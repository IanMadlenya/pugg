         Lola Flores, one of Spain's most popular singers and the star of many film musicals of the 1950's and 60's, died today at her home outside Madrid. She was 72.         She died after a long struggle with breast cancer, her family said.         Her body was transferred to the Villa Cultural Center here to lie in state, as thousands of mourners stood in line to pay their last respects.         Known as "Lola of Spain," or "The Pharaohness" after a role she played in one of her films, Miss Flores came to represent popular flamenco and Spanish folk singing for generations of Spaniards and millions of fans in Latin America. In a message of condolence to her family, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia said, "Spain has lost one of the greatest artists of this century."         Dolores Flores Ruiz was born in 1923 in the southwestern Andalusian town of Jerez de la Frontera. At age 10, she began to sing in local bars and taverns. She won national fame in the 1940's, singing with the popular flamenco artist Manolo Caracol, and landed her first film contract at 17.         She is best remembered for playing ethnic dancing and singing roles, and was often cast as a gypsy or a Mexican peasant. Her most famous films were "Estrella de la Sierra Morena" ("Star of Sierra Morena") of 1952 and "Maria de la O" (1958).         Miss Flores was convicted for tax fraud in 1991, fined 14 million pesetas ($112,000) and sentenced to 16 months in prison, but was released on probation. ("I don't understand about paperwork," she said in her own defense.) Last year the Spanish Government awarded her a gold medal for her life's work.         She is survived by her husband, Antonio Gonzalez, a gypsy flamenco guitarist; two daughters, and a son.       
         Willette Craine Murray, a founder of La Famille restaurant in Harlem, a fixture for Southern food and Sunday-night jazz, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 82.         Her husband, Earle, said she died of a heart attack.         From the time Mrs. Murray and her sister, the late Viola James, opened their restaurant with their husbands, Oswald Craine and Ben James, in 1958, the fresh corn bread, fried chicken, braised short ribs, black-eyed peas and string beans drew crowds to the restaurant, on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street.         When the restaurant was sold in 1989, La Famille, which opened with seating for 40, had spread into three dining rooms, where 300 people could dine while listening to jazz bands that Mrs. Murray helped make a Sunday night fixture.         For Mrs. Murray, a native of Charlotte, N.C., who came to New York in 1933, owning and operating a business on 125th Street was a triumph. One of the first black women to work on 125th Street, she had to march on picket lines in the 1930's to win her first job, washing glasses at a dime-store lunch counter.         She later worked as dining room hostess and assistant banquet manager at the old Theresa Hotel.         Mrs. Murray, whose sister and first husband died many years ago, is survived by Mr. Murray.       
         Elizabeth Montgomery, the pert actress who enchanted television audiences as the star of the long-running comedy series "Bewitched," died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 57.         Last month, Ms. Montgomery underwent surgery for the removal of what was characterized at the time as a small malignant tumor. Her family would not disclose the type of cancer.         "Bewitched," a top-rated ABC situation comedy set in suburbia, ran from 1964 to 1972. Its green-eyed star played Samantha, a witch and the wife of an advertising executive who tried to suppress her supernatural talents yet often resorted to sorcery to solve problems.         The comedic twist was that her efforts to shun witchcraft were strongly resented by her kin. They included Samantha's mother, Endora, played by Agnes Moorehead, and the trouble-making Serena, a look-alike cousin also played by Ms. Montgomery. The clue to Samantha's impending sorcery was a twitch of her nose. The witch's perplexed husband, Darrin, was played first by Dick York and then by Dick Sargent.         "Bewitched" was Ms. Montgomery's first and only television series. After the series ended, she had a successful career as a star in made-for-television movies. One of them, "Deadline for Murder," was broadcast by CBS last week. In it, the actress portrayed the reporter Edna Buchanan, whom she had played in "The Corpse Had a Familiar Face" in 1994.         Ms. Montgomery was born on April 15, 1938, her publicity agent said. Her father was the actor and director Robert Montgomery. Her mother, Elizabeth Allen Montgomery, was an actress.         A native of Los Angeles, she graduated from the Spence School in New York City and attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. After three years of intensive training, she made her television debut in the 1950's television playhouse series "Robert Montgomery Presents," of which her father was the producer and host.         In the 1950's and 60's, she also appeared in films, including "The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell" (1955), with Gary Cooper, and "Johnny Cool" (1963). She was narrator of "The Panama Deception," a documentary about the American invasion of Panama, which won an Academy Award in 1993.         Her television movies often won critical praise. Among them were "A Case of Rape" (1974), "The Legend of Lizzie Borden" (1975) and "Black Widow Murders: The Blanche Taylor Moore Story" (1993).         She is survived by her husband, the actor Robert Foxworth, and three children from an earlier marriage to William Asher, the producer of "Bewitched." Her first husband was the actor Gig Young.       
         Mabel Olsen Phillips, who was president of the United Nations Delegations Women's Club from 1971 to 1973, died on Monday at Arlington Hospital in Virginia. She was 75 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said a daughter, Miriam P. Eley.         Mrs. Phillips worked with a number of social and philanthropic organizations around the world as the wife of a career American diplomat, Christopher H. Phillips.         She was elected president of the cultural, philanthropic and social organization in 1971 while her husband was the Deputy Permanent United States Representative, from 1969 to 1973.         Besides her husband and her daughter, of San Francisco, she is survived by another daughter, Victoria P. Corbett of Manhattan; a son, David W., of Mountain View, Calif., and five grandchildren.       
         Anne Homer Doerflinger, a writer whose stories appeared in numerous magazines, died on Tuesday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. She was 87 and lived in Convent Station, N.J.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Writing under the name Anne Homer, Mrs. Doerflinger contributed more than 100 short stories to The Ladies Home Journal, The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle and other magazines.         Mrs. Doerflinger, a 1929 graduate of Smith College, was the daughter of Louise Homer, a noted Metropolitan Opera contralto.         She is survived by her husband, William; three sons, Thomas, of Summit, N.J., Jonathan Warner of Pelham, N.Y., and William Warner of Buffalo; a daughter, Ann Resmond of San Francisco; a sister, Katherine Homer Fryer of Manhattan, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mildred Finger Haines, who helped shape fashion tastes for four decades as a top buyer for department stores and a consultant to clothes makers and retailers, died on Saturday. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was a heart attack, family members said.         From the late 1940's through the late 1960's, Mrs. Haines, known throughout her career as Mildred Finger, was a buyer of ready-to-wear at Macy's, Ohrbach's and Bergdorf Goodman, and one of New York City's most often cited taste makers. At Bergdorf's, in particular, she was noted for bringing European styles to American consumers.         She later became vice president of Charles of the Ritz, headed fashion merchandising for Yves St.Laurent and became an independent consultant, with clients like the Limited and Arthur D. Little.         Suffering from multiple sclerosis, she retired in 1986. In succeeding years, she frequently contributed her knowledge of the fashion industry to the oral history projects of the American Jewish Committee and the Fashion Institute of Technology.         Mrs. Haines is survived by her husband, Robert; two sons, Matthew and Daniel, both of Manhattan; a sister, Bella Finger Kleinman of the Bronx; a daughter-in-law, Francine Kane of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Joan Thayer Hupper, Miss Joan of "Romper Room" in New York City from 1957 to 1961, died last Friday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         For the New York production of "Romper Room," Mrs. Hupper kept a changing cast of six toddlers busy for an hour playing games and learning. The program was broadcast on weekdays.         Mrs. Hupper was born in Rockville Centre, L.I., and graduated from Goucher College with a major in psychology.         She is survived by her husband, Joel H. Hupper; a daughter, Anne Gans of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a son, David of Sudbury, Mass.; a sister, Marjorie Fernald of Brunswick, Me., and a grandson.       
         Kathryn Haeseler Stone, a former Virginia legislator who challenged school segregation and a reapportionment plan that penalized urban voters, died last Friday at her home in Alexandria, Va. She was 88 and had been a longtime resident of Arlington, Va.         Elected to the Virginia Legislature five months before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. the Board of Education in 1954, she became an early promoter of school desegregation. She was among those who argued that the state keep open its public schools and resist the spreading move to privatize schools as a means of resisting integration.         Mrs. Stone was also one of four plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging Virginia's reapportionment plan that reached the Supreme Court in 1964. The suit was joined with similiar efforts in other states that argued that the plans drawn by rural-dominated state legislatures were unfair to more heavily-populated areas. The Court's decision forced the redrawing of districts to balance the representation of urban and rural voters.         A Democrat, she retired from the Virginia House in 1966.         Born in Lisbon, Iowa, she received undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Iowa in 1927 and 1932. With her husband, Harold A. Stone, she undertook in the late 1930's a study of some 25 county and town governments. With Donald K. Price, the Stones wrote two books published by the Public Service Administration in 1940, "City Manager Government in the U.S." and "Case Studies in City Manager Government."         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Paul of Orwell, Vt.; two daughters, Suzanne Stone of Narbeth, Pa., and Joanna Stone of North Leverett, Mass.; a sister, Virginia M. Miller of Chula Vista, Calif.; five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Vivian Cadden, a New York writer and magazine editor, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cardiovascular disease, her family said.         A former senior editor of Redbook and McCall's magazines, she became the founding editor of Working Mother in 1978. She retired as its editor in 1990 but continued to write for the magazine.         She contributed to publications including Life, The Nation, Mademoiselle and Parents. Her articles often dealt with political matters, and she interviewed national and international figures.         She was born in the Bronx, graduated from Vassar College in 1938 and studied economics at Columbia University.         Her husband, Joseph E. Cadden, died in 1980. She is survived by two daughters, Joan, of Gambier, Ohio, and Wendy, of Falls Creek, N.M.; a son, Frank, of Manhattan; a brother, Bernard Liebman, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and one grandson.       
         Margaret Chase Smith, a flinty, independent Maine Republican who made history as the first woman to win election to both houses of Congress and the first whose name was advanced for the Presidency at a national convention, died yesterday at at her home in Skowhegan, Me. She was 97 years old.         A spokeswoman from the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan said she had died of complications from a stroke eight days earlier that had left her in a coma.         A red rose was Mrs. Smith's trademark, a stalwart conscience, her beacon. She was known as the "conscience of the Senate."         In four terms in the House, from 1941 to 1949, then four in the Senate through 1975, Mrs. Smith won friends and earned foes across a wide political spectrum. She could number among her enemies such polar opposites as the Communist-hunting Joseph R. McCarthy and the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev. The formidable Mr. McCarthy referred sneeringly to Mrs. Smith as a "Snow White," and Mr. Khrushchev saw her as "the devil in the disguise of a woman."         Mrs. Smith said her life in politics was her only life. "I have no family, no time-consuming hobbies," she said late in her Senate career. "I have only myself and my job as United States Senator."         But she also had a sense of humor.  In 1952, when asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: "I'd go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I'd go home."         Though Mrs. Smith seemed to many people a champion of women's rights, she said she did not regard herself as a feminist. "I was treated fairly in the Senate, not because of equal rights but because of seniority," she said in a 1975 interview.         In her dedication to her work, she answered 2,941 consecutive Senate roll-calls, a series broken only when she underwent a hip operation in 1968. In time, she became the ranking Republican on the Armed Services and Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committees, and served as well on the Appropriations Committee.         Never anything but a Republican, Mrs. Smith was hardly the dyed-in-the-wool variety. Party regulars could never take her vote for granted. She voted as she saw fit.         In the 1950's, Mrs. Smith alienated McCarthy by joining with six other Republican senators in making a "declaration of conscience" in which she took the measure of McCarthy's sensationalist, inquisitorial methods in trying to suppress Communism.  "I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horseman of calumny -- fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear," Mrs. Smith said. McCarthy responded by referring to her and the six other senators as "Snow White and the Six Dwarfs."         Khrushchev was understandably restrained when Mrs. Smith, a consistent advocate of a strong military, criticized President John F. Kennedy because she thought he lacked the will to use nuclear weapons and concluded that such restraint weakened America's struggle against the Soviet Union. When Mr. Khrushchev heard of Mrs. Smith's stance, he said he thought it had beaten "all records of savagery."         But Mrs. Smith replied: "Mr. Khrushchev isn't really mad at me. I am not that important. He is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech."         Shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy called Mrs. Smith a "formidable political figure" against whom he would not like to campaign. The morning after his death, she went into the Senate chamber before it convened and laid a red rose on Kennedy's old desk.         As a member of Congress she supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, much to the dismay of her more conservative colleagues. Over the years, she angered fellow Republicans by supporting Federal aid to education in 1948, by voting against Lewis L. Strauss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's nominee for Secretary of Commerce in 1959, and by opposing President Richard M. Nixon's unsuccessful nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement F. Haynsworth in 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in 1970.         She was a strong supporter of civil rights and, again irritating some Republican colleagues, an early advocate of Government-financed medical care for the elderly.         Margaret Madeline Chase was born on Dec. 14, 1897, in Skowhegan on the Kennebec River in central Maine. Her father, George Emery Chase, was the town barber and her mother was the former Carrie Murray.         As the eldest of six children in a family of modest means, Margaret was expected to work -- and that she did even as a schoolgirl; she was skillful enough to shave her father's customers when he was busy or away from the shop.         After graduating from Skowhegan High School in 1916, she held jobs for which a college education was not always required: telephone operator, circulation manager for a weekly newspaper, grade-school teacher and eventually a woolen mill executive.         In 1930, at the age of 32, she married Clyde H. Smith, who was 22 years her senior and co-owner of the local newspaper. Mr. Smith, who was prominent in local Republican circles, ran for office and in 1937 was elected Representative from Maine's Second Congressional District.         In 1940, seriously ill after suffering a heart attack, Mr. Smith asked Maine voters to continue his policies by electing his wife to succeed him. After his death, she was chosen to fill his unexpired term in a special election and was elected in her own right later that year.         In 1948 Mrs. Smith entered the Republican senatorial primary and received more votes than her three male opponents combined. In the general election she easily defeated her Democratic rival, Dr. Adrian Scolten.         She said she considered taking her maiden name back after her husband's death, adding: "My name was Chase. It's a good New England name. I liked it. But legally I was Smith."         She quickly grew in stature as a senator and was mentioned as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1952 and again in 1968. In 1964 Mrs. Smith announced her candidacy for President and ran in the New Hampshire primary that year. She drew more than a dozen votes at the Republican National Convention, which was controlled by the conservative forces backing Barry Goldwater.         She seemed unstopable until 1972, when William D. Hathaway, a 48-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress, defeated her in her campaign for a fifth Senate term. She was 74 at the time and seemed increasingly frail, riding the Capitol corridors on a small yellow cart and carrying a cane. There were rumors that her health was fragile, but she remained robust for many years.         In her later years she was no less independent but grew weary and wary of militants.         In 1970, 20 years after she had denounced McCarthy's scare tactics, she said that those on the radical left who advocated violence were easily the equal to the menace she had perceived from the radical right two decades earlier. "We had a national sickness then from which we recovered," she said. "We have a national sickness now from which I pray we will recover."         But, true to form, she also attacked those in the Government who, she believed, had overreacted to the anti-war demonstrators.         Mrs. Smith did not remarry after the death of her husband. She is survived by a sister, Evelyn Williams of Skowhegan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Jean Muir, the British fashion classicist whose design career spanned more than 30 years, died on Sunday in London at the London Clinic. She was 66.         She died of breast cancer, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.         Often referred to as the doyenne of British fashion, Miss Muir, as she insisted everyone call her, designed starkly simple clothes that were timeless and elegant. A perfectionist who tried on everything she designed, she was best known for matte jersey dresses, supple suedes, featherlight punched leathers and cashmere sweaters.         She considered herself a dressmaker first and foremost, yet employed tailoring techniques to achieve the controlled flow of fabric that gave her jersey dresses their signature fit. The shoulders were small, the waist slightly raised and the skirt fluid. It was a shape that particularly suited her petite figure. The dresses were nearly always in the somber black and navy blue she preferred and wore almost exclusively.         Miss Muir developed a personal style that changed very little. For most of her life, her reddish brown hair was cut into a straight bob, her face was chalky white and her lipstick the color of black currants. Her London apartment was entirely white, down to the white rubber flooring. She was frequently quoted as saying, "When you find something that suits you and never lets you down, why not stick with it?" It was a statement that applied equally well to herself and to the clothes she designed, which were instantly identifiable as Jean Muirs and never followed the vagaries of fashion.         "Jean was unique and original and irreplaceable," said Geraldine Stutz, the former president and owner of Henri Bendel in New York, which carried Miss Muir's clothing from the early 60's until the late 80's. The clothes can now be found at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Linda Dresner.         "You can say unique and irreplaceable," Ms. Stutz added, "but in Jean's case it is literally and historically true. For years, other designers tried to copy the Jean Muir look and failed. The only ones who didn't try were the French, who called her 'la reine de la robe,' the dress queen."         Yet, Miss Muir never had formal design training. Born in London and of Scottish descent, she attended boarding school in Bedfordshire, where she was taught sewing and knitting. At 11 she started to make clothes for herself and at 19 went to work in the stockroom at Liberty, the London store. She eventually became a sketcher in the store's made-to-measure department, and she went to Jaeger as a designer in 1956.         In 1962, she became the designer for Jane & Jane, a company of young Londoners who, along with designers like Mary Quant, helped to shake up the staid British fashion world. That was when she caught the eye of Jean Rosenberg, the foresighted buyer who brought her to Bendel's.         In 1966, she formed Jean Muir Ltd. in partnership with her husband, Harry Lueckert, a former German actor she had married in 1955. In her own business she was able to develop the style of clothing that appealed to women as diverse as Princess Alexandra, Lady Antonia Fraser, Glenda Jackson, Lauren Bacall and Joanna Lumley, the co-star of the British comedy "Absolutely Fabulous," who once worked as a Jean Muir model.         She won many fashion awards, including election to the British Fashion Awards Hall of Fame last year, and was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1984. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1973. She served on the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1979 to 1983 and became a trustee the next year.         Miss Muir, who had no children, is survived by her husband. She will be buried at Lorbottle, her estate in Northumberland, 15 miles from the Scottish border. A memorial service will be held at a later date.       
         Dr. Janine Andre-Schwartz, an immunologist and specialist in electron microscopy, died on April 26 at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 62 and lived in Brookline, Mass.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman at the center, where she was a medical researcher in the division of hematology/oncology.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz was also an associate professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. She had been on the staff of both institutions for 26 years. Working with the electron microscope, she contributed to research on immunological disease.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz did much of her research in collaboration with her husband, Dr. Robert S. Schwartz, now deputy editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Andre-Schwartz is survived by a son, Louis-George Schwartz of New York City; two sisters, Francoise Poutiers of Bordeaux, France, and Claude Andre of Paris, and a brother, Jean-Pierre Andre, also of Paris.       
         Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.         Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929.         "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."         As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."         She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."         Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.         In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.         In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."         In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."         The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.         Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Ann M. Lingg, who wrote articles and books about music and musicians, died on Tuesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lingg, who was born in Austria and earned a doctoral degree in musicology in Vienna, moved to New York City in 1938. In the 1940's and 50's she wrote about music for a number of national magazines. She was also the author of several books about musicians, including "Mozart" (1946) and "Mephisto Waltz: The Story of Franz Liszt" (1951) and, for younger readers, "John Philip Sousa" (1955). She collaborated with Ruth Slenczynska, a pianist, on "Music at Your Fingertips" (1961), a book of practical advice for young musicians. She was also a frequent contributor to Opera News magazine and to Aria, a publication of the Metropolitan Opera Guild.         Ms. Lingg's husband, Erwin C. Lessner, died in 1959.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Ermina Stimson, an illustrator, art director and fashion editor during 36 years with Women's Wear Daily, died on Tuesday at her home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 93.         Ms. Stimson, who began her career at Women's Wear Daily as an illustrator in 1930, was appointed fashion editor in 1960, a job she held for six years before retiring.         She was born in Stratford, Conn., and graduated from Smith College in 1923. She then moved to Paris, where she worked for several fashion publications.         Her first husband, George Kinnell, died in 1937. Her second, Capt. Joseph Goble of the Royal Navy, was killed in World War II. She is survived by her son, George Kinnell of Canyon, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Beryl Jackson of Avon, England, and a grandson.       
         Sally Moffet, a stage and television actress, died on Monday at her home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. She was 63.         The cause was lung cancer, said George Dessart, her companion.         Ms. Moffet appeared on Broadway in "The Young and the Fair" (1948), "The Member of the Wedding" (1950) and "Desk Set" (1955). Her Off Broadway credits included Dylan Thomas's "Under Milk Wood" and Tennessee Williams's "Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot." She also appeared at a number of regional theaters and acted in summer stock companies.         On television, Ms. Moffet had roles in productions by "Studio One," "Armstrong Circle Theater" and "Philco Television Playhouse."         Ms. Moffet's husband, the actor Mike Kellin, died in 1983.         In addition to Mr. Dessart, she is survived by her mother, Sylvia Field of Fall Brook, Calif.; three stepbrothers, James Truex of New York City and Philip and Barry Truex of California; three sons, Harold Dozier of West Nyack, N.Y.; Aaron Dozier of Los Angeles, and Brendan Dozier of San Diego; a daughter, Shauna Kellin of West Nyack, and two grandchildren.       
         Alice Manheim Kaplan, an art collector and a leading supporter of the arts in New York City, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Kaplan was involved with New York City civic groups and with many museums throughout her life. In 1982 she received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture.         She was born in Budapest in 1903, and two years later her family moved to New York City, where she grew up. She attended Teachers College of Columbia University but left school to marry in 1925. Years later, she resumed her studies and received a master's degree in art history from Columbia University when she was 63.         For 10 years, from 1967 to 1977, she was the president of the American Federation of the Arts, where she developed many traveling exhibitions and produced an educational film, "The Art of Seeing." She also served on many boards, including those of the Museum of American Folk Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         She headed the advisory council for the department of art and archeology at Columbia University. She was also a member of the visiting committee of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University and served on visiting committees at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was on a committee to save Cooper Union Museum, now the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum.         With her husband, J. M. Kaplan, a financier who founded the J. M. Kaplan Fund in 1945, she was instrumental in the campaign to save Carnegie Hall when it was threatened with demolition in 1960. She was married to Mr. Kaplan for 62 years, until his death in 1987.         Although she insisted throughout her life that she wasn't a collector, Mrs. Kaplan was known for her extraordinary eye and flair. She often bought artworks before the artists were discovered.         On one occasion, browsing through an antique shop, she spotted a neo-classical drawing and bought it for $200. When she returned home and began researching the drawing, she discovered it was a long-lost preliminary study for Jacques Louis David's "Oath of the Horatii," which hangs in the Louvre.         Mrs. Kaplan also bought works by artists like the American painter Ammi Phillips and the Austrian artist Egon Schiele before they were well known. She discovered Schiele's work quite by accident. When she got off the elevator of the Fuller Building on the wrong floor one afternoon, she spotted some drawings by the artist, which she promptly bought. "That's how the collection grew," she once said. "Often the result of chance and circumstance rather than a systematic approach."         Mrs. Kaplan was known for her great style as a hostess, entertaining at her homes in New York City and East Hampton, L.I. In her spare time she was also a portrait painter and pianist.         She is survived by two brothers, Paul E. Manheim of New York City and Frank J. Manheim of London; a sister, Louise Espy of Manhattan; three daughters, the former State Parks Commissioner Joan K. Davidson, Elizabeth K. Fonseca and Mary E. Kaplan, all of Manhattan; a son, Richard D. Kaplan of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Julia Adler Foshko, the last surviving member of a generation of Adlers who began their theatrical careers on stage with their parents in the Yiddish theater, died yesterday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 97 and  had been a resident of the Actors Fund Home in Englewood for many years.         Although she was eventually eclipsed by her younger siblings, Stella and Luther, Miss Adler, the middle of the five children of Jacob and Sarah Adler, the founding stars of the American Yiddish theater, had her moments in the spotlight.         Among other Broadway roles in the 1920's, she played Shylock's daughter, Jessica, in the David Warfield production of "The Merchant of Venice," and was cast by David Belasco as the star of "Rosa Machree."         Her last Broadway appearance was in the 1939 revival of the Clifford Odets play "Awake and Sing!" in a part originated by her sister Stella in the initial  production four years earlier. "Julia Adler," wrote Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times, "improves a little upon Stella Adler's playing."         She later toured with her brother Luther in "Tovarich," which appeared at the City Center in 1952.         Like her brothers and sisters -- including two older full siblings, Frances and Jay, and three still older half siblings, Abe, Charles and Celia Adler, born from her father's two previous marriages and an intervening liason in Russia --  Miss Adler began her career early.         The Adler children were generally thrust on stage as toddlers, but Julia, who was born on July 4, 1897, almost broke the record. According to family legend, she arrived moments after her mother had completed a matinee performance in Philadelphia.         There were a lot of Adler mouths to feed, but, fortunately, there were a lot  of parts to go around.         In 1930, the family, including Julia and her mother, Sarah, took 9 of the 10  roles of a George Jessel production, "Millions." The Adlers graciously allowed the director, Joseph Schoenhold, to play the 10 part.         Miss Adler's older siblings, Frances and Jay, died many years ago. Luther, died in 1984 at the age of 81, and Stella, who operated a celebrated Method acting school in New York City, died in 1992 at the age of 91.         Miss Adler, whose husband, Joseph Foshko, the artist, died many years ago, is survived by a daughter, Judy Sure, of Nantucket; three grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
         Anne Ratner, a music patron who kept alive the idea of the music salon, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Ratner put on concerts by first-rate artists in the living room of her Riverside Drive apartment. Among those who appeared, often more than once, were the Emerson and Juilliard Quartets, the singers Arleen Auger and Cecilia Bartoli and the pianists Richard Goode, Jeffrey Kahane and Andras Schiff. Appearance at these evenings became somewhat of a status symbol among musicians, and they often served as showcases for emerging talents.         Ms. Ratner, who organized these evenings by herself, asked each person in the small audiences for at least $30, but personal profit was not on her mind. Ms. Ratner was born in Russia and reared in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She studied the piano and in 1929 married Hyman Ratner. After her husband died in 1960, she taught at the League Center for Seriously Disturbed Children in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The salon concerts -- up to 18 per season -- developed through her work at the center and served as benefit events for the center and for Camphill Village, a community in Copake, N.Y., for mentally handicapped adults.         She is survived by two daughters, Molly Finn of Manhattan and Judy Pitt of Leonia, N.J.; two sisters, Rebecca Jarmon of Forest Hills, Queens, and Mina Gudeon of Sunrise, Fla.; a brother, Saul Kamen of North Hills, L.I., eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Claire Sterling, an American author and correspondent based in Italy, who was known for her writings on terrorism, assassination and crime, died yesterday in a hospital in Arezzo, Italy. She was 76 and lived in outside of Cortona, near Arezzo.         She had cancer of the colon, her husband said.         Mrs. Sterling was based in Italy for more than 30 years and traveled widely. Her most recent book, "Thieves' World: The Threat of the New Global Network of Organized Crime" (1994, Simon & Schuster), was praised by Stephen Handelman, of the Harriman Institute of Advanced Soviet Studies at Columbia University, as making "a significant contribution to post-cold-war debate" by affirming "that the growing interdependence among nation-states and financial institutions has made it easier for crime syndicates to cooperate across national boundaries."         In an earlier book, "Octopus: the Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (1990), she examined the Sicilian Mafia and charged gangster-chieftains based in Palermo with creating a multinational empire with the United States as its longtime main target.         In her 1984 book "The Time of the Assassins," Mrs. Sterling examined the attempt by a Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981. She contended that Mr. Agca had "come to Rome as a professional hit man, hired by a Bulgarian spy ring." She presented what she called "massive proof that the Soviet Union and its surrogates have provided the weapons, training and sanctuary for a worldwide terror network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic society."         Mrs. Sterling's contention about a Bulgarian role in the attack was disputed, but writing in 1991, she maintained that Italian courts in 1988 had "expressed their moral certainty that Bulgaria's secret service was behind the papal shooting."         She also attracted wide attention with her 1981 book "The Terror Network," which traced connections among terrorist groups around the globe. William Abrahams, who edited the book for Holt, Rinehart & Winston, said that while she was writing it, the Italian Government posted a guard at her house to protect her.         A decade later, the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis reported that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration, had held up a copy of "The Terror Network" before a group of official intelligence experts and had "said contemptuously that he had learned more from it than from all of them."         Mrs. Sterling's first book was "The Masaryk Case" (1969), about Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister who was reported to have leaped to his death in 1948 from a window of his Prague apartment. She concluded that he had been killed by Soviet or Czechoslovak Stalinists to keep him from defecting to the West.         In her decades abroad, she also wrote articles for The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, The Reporter magazine, Life, Reader's Digest, Harper's, The New Republic, The Washington Post, International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.         Mrs. Sterling was born Claire Neikind in Queens, received a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College, and worked for a time as a union organizer among electrical workers.         In 1945 she received a master's degree from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, which awarded her a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.         She went on to work in Rome for what she described in a 1981 interview as "a fly-by-night American news agency." She learned Italian, and when the agency went out of business, she returned to the United States and joined the staff of The Reporter magazine, which began publication in early 1949.         Mrs. Sterling recalled that when she applied for the Reporter job, Max Ascoli, the magazine's Italian-born publisher and editor, said, "If anybody's going to write about Italy around here, it's me." So because of her union experience, she became the labor editor.         In 1951, she married Tom Sterling, a writer. She remembered that "Max Ascoli's wedding present to me was a six-month assignment in Rome."         Mrs. Sterling's six-month assignment lasted 17 years, ending only when The Reporter ceased publication in 1968. By then, the Sterlings were accustomed to life in Italy, where Mr. Sterling had written some of his more than a dozen books. So Mrs. Sterling, keeping Italy as her base, began writing her Masaryk book.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Luke, of Cortona; a daughter, Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; two grandchildren, and a sister, Ethel Braun of Manhattan.       
         Claire K. Tholl, whose recommendation to preserve more than 200 stone houses led New Jersey and the Federal Government to include many of them on a list of protected historic buildings, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 69 and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Tholl was trustee emeritus of the Bergen County Historical Society, a title created for her. She also had been a member of the county's Historic Site Advisory Board since 1969. It was for the board that she conducted a survey of sandstone structures dating as far back as the 1600's.         "The board decided that our stone houses were being threatened with demolition, so funding was acquired and she did the stone house survey in 1979 and 1980," Ruth Van Wagoner, director of the county Office of Cultural and Historic Affairs, said yesterday. "More than 200 were placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, and about 190 were placed on the National Register."         Among the buildings shielded as a result of the survey by Mrs. Tholl was the 282-year-old Steuben House, a mansion of Bergen County sandstone in Dutch Colonial style in River Edge. The mansion was used as a headquarters by George Washington in 1780 and was given to Gen. Friedrich von Steuben as a reward after the Revolutionary War as a reward for being Washington's drillmaster. It was saved by the state from demolition in 1928 through eminent-domain proceedings.         A native of Hackensack, Claire Koch Tholl studied engineering and naval designing at Stevens Institute of Technology and graduated in architecture from Cooper Union in 1947.         She began her historic research in 1944, after working as a draftsman and in boat design, technical illustration and cartography. She later added architectural photography to her interests.         By 1960 she was studying old houses. She advised the restorers of Steuben House, Old Stone Church in Saddle River and Ringwood Manor in Ringwood, among many others.         She also was knowledgeable about early cooking methods and utensils and the kind of foods favored in the past, and the farms that produced them. For the Bicentennial year 1976 she wrote about the foods of the past in the introduction of an illustrated collection of regional and historic recipes.         Mrs. Tholl is survived by two daughters, Lisanne Fogel of Bellingham, Mass., and Andrea Dente of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Robert, of Morristown, N.J., and James, of Queensbury, N.Y., and five grandchildren. Her husband, Edward, an architect, died in 1967.       
         Sylvia Laibman Horwitz, a world traveler, an author and a founder of two schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Paul Horwitz.         When the guns stopped firing in Europe in 1945, Mrs. Horwitz was part of one of the first boatloads of American civilians headed for Italy to join spouses on special assignment on the war-ravaged continent. Her husband, Louis Horwitz, a social worker, was working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in the resettlement of refugees.         She quickly found that the disarray of postwar Rome extended to newcomers as well as to survivors. There was no school for English-speaking children, so she helped start one and served as its first director. The Overseas School of Rome is still in operation. She had already helped found the Downtown Community School, a private elementary school in Greenwich Village, in the early 1940's.         Her tenure in Rome also kindled an interest in archeology.         When her husband was posted in Tunisia, she began to explore the past of her new home and the site of ancient Carthage. Study there and later in Tiberias inspired her third book, "The Find of a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Evans and the Discovery of Knossos" (Viking, 1980). It celebrated the discoveries of one of history's greatest amateur archeologists, Arthur Evans, who uncovered evidence of a Minoan civilization in Crete dating back to 3500 B.C.         She also wrote the books "Toulouse-Lautrec: His World" (Harper, 1973) and "Francisco Goya: Painter of Kings and Demons" (Harper, 1974).         She was born in Newcastle, Pa., and grew up in Cleveland. She graduated from Case Western University in 1932 and moved to Manhattan, where she was a copywriter. Later, she was a teacher at the New School for Social Research.         Her husband died in 1979. In addition to her son, of Concord, Mass., she is survived by a sister, Natalie Barr of Lamoine, Me., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Wednesday about Sylvia Laibman Horwitz of Manhattan, an author and founder of two schools who died on June 18, misidentified the college she attended. Mrs. Horwitz graduated in 1932 from Flora Stone Mather College for Women, not from Case Western Reserve University. The women's college later became part of a university that helped form Case Western Reserve University in 1967.       
         Mary Raffa, the mother of Matilda Cuomo, former First Lady of New York, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I.         She was 91 and lived in Lake Success, N.Y.         Mrs. Raffa was born in Sicily and came to New York City in 1928.         Her husband, Charles, died in 1988. In addition to Matilda, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by another daughter, Nancy Mazzola, of Montville, N.J.; three sons, Frank, of Lake Success; Sam, of Syosset, L.I., and Joseph, of San Diego, 15 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.       
         Rema Hort Mann, a cable television executive, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 30.         The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hort Mann was the licensing manager for Cablevision in Woodbury, L.I., handling market programming, licensing and negotiations for pay-per-view events. Previously, she was an independent consultant with National Economic Research Associates in White Plains and a senior consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co. in Manhattan.         She graduated from Tufts University in 1986 with a degree in computer science. In 1991, she received an M.B.A. in corporate strategic planning from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.         Mrs. Hort Mann is survived by her husband, Billy Mann; her parents, Susan and Michael Hort of Scarsdale, N.Y.; her grandparents, Dr. Selig and Blanche Strax of Queens; two brothers, Andrew and Peter, of Manhattan, and a sister, Shoshana, of Scarsdale.       
         Esther Rome, co-author of the best seller "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and women's health advocate for more than 25 years, died at her home in Somerville, Mass., on Saturday. She was 49.         The cause was breast cancer, said a friend, Judith Norsigian.         Ms. Rome argued that issues of cosmetic surgery, eating disorders, body image and sexually transmitted diseases as they affected women belonged in the social- and economic-policy arena as much as in the medical world. She was instrumental in fostering the public debate over toxic shock syndrome and its link to the use of tampons in the early 1980's.         A decade later, she served as a consumer advocate on the Food and Drug Administration committee that investigated the potential hazards of silicone breast implants. The committee's work led to a partial ban on implants and Ms. Rome led a support group for women with implants who had health problems.         Until days before her death, she was working on her latest book, "Risking Health for Love," with her co-author, Jane Hyman, that examines the health risks of choices that women make, covering breast implants, sexually transmitted diseases and domestic violence.         Ms. Rome was among 12 young professional women who were not medical experts but who were concerned about health issues who gathered in a lounge at M.I.T. in 1969 to exchange the information about doctors and other health topics. The group later formed the Boston Women's Health Book Collective.         A year later, the women published a collection of papers challenging long-held approaches to medical treatment of women. The papers addressed a range of topics including childbirth and rape. Called "Women and Their Bodies," it was a 75-cent newsprint guide to the physical and psychological makeup of women. In 1971 they changed the name to "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and the book inspired a grass-roots, consumer-advocacy movement, becoming a bible to a generation of young women.         In college dormitories and apartments across the country groups of female baby-boomers, hungry for the kind of information their mothers did not always have, gathered to discuss the book. They formed support groups and grappled with women's health issues made more immediate by the availability of birth-control pills and the legalization of abortion.         The book was attacked as pornographic by the Moral Majority and other conservative groups and it was banned from some schools. By 1973 it had sold more than 350,000 copies. Now in its third edition, it has sold nearly three million copies in the United States and has been translated into 14 foreign languages, including Hebrew, Swedish and Greek, said a spokeswoman for its publisher, Simon & Schuster.         Ms. Rome was born in Norwich, Conn. She graduated from Brandeis University in 1966 and received a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1968.         She is survived by her husband, Nathan; two sons, Judah and Micah, both of Somerville; two brothers, Aaron Seidman of Brookline and Abe Seidman of Beverly Hills, Calif., and a sister, Sara Levine of Dallas.       
         Elizabeth Flower, professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a standard history of philosophy, died on Monday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She was 80 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said Prof. Gary Hatfield, chairman of Penn's department of philosophy, from which she retired in 1985.         Dr. Flower, whose affiliation with the university dated from her student days, was the author with Murray G. Murphey of the two-volume "History of Philosophy in America" (Putnam, 1977). She herself was honored in 1988 with a volume "Values and Value Theory in Twentieth Century America: Essays in Honor of Elizabeth Flower" (Temple University Press), edited by Professor Murphey and Ivar Berg.         Among her multitude of students, many of whom now teach around the country, was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He attended her first graduate seminar, Ethics and Philosophy in History.         "Martin Luther King's contribution to the discussion was solid and articulate," she recalled later. "Interestingly, questions of discrimination did not seem to have come up, but questions of peace and of conflict, of moral order and the effectiveness of a moral stance -- as in Gandhi -- were much in the air. And in all this his thought was already vigorous and well forged."         Dr. Flower's teaching and writings were credited at Penn with having advanced the field of ethics. Many of her doctoral students went on to work in the ethics and philosophy of law.         Professor Hatfield said she had carried on the Pragmatist school of philosophy in the United States.         Elizabeth Farquhar Flower was born in Atlantic City. She received her Ph.D. at Penn in 1939, two years after she started her academic career as an assistant instructor. She received her promotion to full professor in 1974.         Dr. Flower is survived by her husband, Prof. Abraham Edel; a stepdaughter, Deborah Edel of Manhattan, and three stepsons.       
         Lana Turner, who built a successful movie career on her first screen appearance as a teen-age "sweater girl," died yesterday. She was 75 and lived in Los Angeles.         "She just took a breath and she was gone," her daughter, Cheryl Crane, was quoted as saying in Daily Variety, a trade newspaper. Miss Turner, who had been treated for throat cancer, apparently died of natural causes, a police spokeswoman, Ramona Baety, confirmed to The Associated Press.         Miss Turner was discovered in 1937 by a reporter as she sipped a soda in a Hollywood ice cream parlor while cutting a secretarial class at her high school. The encounter led to her first film role, in "They Won't Forget." Wearing a skintight sweater and skirt, she sauntered along a street, spoke not one line, was murdered in the first reel and began a quick climb to stardom.         Her best performance was that of an unfulfilled wife who persuades a drifter to kill her husband, in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946). Other major roles were a rebellious student in "These Glamour Girls" (1939), a shallow performer in "Ziegfeld Girl" (1941) and an alcoholic actress in "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952).         Recalling "The Bad and the Beautiful," John Houseman, the producer, said he and Vincente Minnelli, the director, had agreed Miss Turner "was capable of brilliant individual scenes, but seemed to lack the temperament or the training to sustain a full-length performance."         "This made our episodic film just right for her," Mr. Houseman said.         Mr. Minnelli recalled using "many ruses and subterfuges" to extract a major performance from Miss Turner, adding, "As she got more into the picture her nervousness disappeared, and she effectively made the character's transition from tramp to glamour queen."         The actress, a star at MGM for 17 years, was a quintessential product of the Hollywood studio system. She recalled in 1969: "It was all beauty and it was all power. Once you had it made, they protected you; they gave you stardom. The ones who kept forging ahead became higher and higher and brighter and brighter and they were stars. And they were treated like stars. We had the best."         Her stormy personal life, peppered by many marriages and publicized romances, was as lurid as many of her films, but her identity as a sex symbol served to insulate her career from scandal's consequences. The most sensational incident occurred in 1958 when her lover, Johnny Stompanato, threatened to disfigure her and was stabbed to death with a carving knife by her 14-year-old daughter, Cheryl Crane. A jury exonerated her daughter with a finding of justifiable homicide.         Miss Turner was born on Feb. 8, 1920 in Wallace, Idaho, and was named Julia Jean Mildred Frances Turner. Her father, John, was a miner. The family soon moved to San Francisco, where her parents separated and her father was mugged and murdered. Her mother, Mildred, became a beautician and moved to Los Angeles, where the girl lived for a while in a foster home before returning to her mother.         Her discovery in a soda shop led to an interview with Mervyn LeRoy, the director and producer, who advised her to chose a catchy first name and began guiding her career. She chose Lana and began appearing in films, including "Love Finds Andy Hardy" (1938), "Calling Dr. Kildare" (1939) and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." She studied with a dramatic coach and soon co-starred successfully with such leading M-G-M actors as Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable and Robert Taylor.         Her acting was often barely passable, but she was convincing in love scenes and in some melodramas. Her films included "Green Dolphin Street" (1947), "Cass Timberlane" (1947), "The Three Musketeers" (1948), "The Merry Widow" (1952), "The Rains of Ranchipur" (1955) and "Diane" (1956).         Miss Turner was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 for her portrayal of a neurotic mother in the film adaptation of Grace Metalious's novel "Peyton Place." In many later movies, including remakes of "Imitation of Life" (1959) and "Madame X" (1966), she played heroines racked by sacrifice and suffering.         On television, her most ambitious effort was "The Survivors," a lavish, prime-time soap opera based on the Harold Robbins novel about a sordid banking family. Later, she toured in several plays, including the comedy "Forty Carats."         Miss Turner's 1982 memoir, "Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth," focused on her eight marriages and many romances. The memoir also recalled a suicide attempt, two abortions, three stillbirths, alcoholism and her religious awakening in 1980.         Miss Turner was married to and divorced from Artie Shaw, the band leader; Stephen Crane, a restaurateur (they were married and divorced twice); Bob Topping, a sportsman; Lex Barker, an actor whose roles included Tarzan; Fred May, a businessman and rancher; Robert P. Eaton, a businessman, and Ronald Dante, a nightclub hypnotist.         She is survived by her daughter.       
         Ellen Jay Garrison, the widow of the Manhattan attorney Lloyd K. Garrison and a featured performer in the Woody Allen film "Zelig" at the age of 83, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Mrs. Garrison was born in Boston and attended the Brearley School. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1920. In the 1950's she served as president of Women United for the United Nations. A direct descendant of John Jay, she was a longtime trustee of the John Jay Homestead in Bedford, N.Y.         Her husband was a New York lawyer and civil rights advocate who served on numerous Federal agencies and commissions in the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations and was president of the New York City Board of Education in the mid-1960's. He died in 1991.         Mrs. Garrison, who had never acted, caught the attention of the critics with her performance as Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the eccentric psychiatrist whose younger self was played by Mia Farrow. During the film, she delivers a series of monologues ruminating on her tempestuous relationship with Zelig. She was recommended for the role by a friend who knew the film's casting director.         She is survived by two daughters, Clarinda, of Vierset-Barse, Belgium, and Ellen S. Kean of Weston, Conn.; a son, Lloyd, of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Vera Aberle Ries, whose living room was lined from floor to ceiling with one of the country's richest private collections of early children's books, died at her home in Forest Hills, Queens, on Monday. She was 86.         Mrs. Ries's husband, Ludwig, began the collection in 1958 with trips to New England villages to rummage at antique stores and thrift shops. Mrs. Ries continued the search after his death in 1968, working mainly through catalogues.         The collection boasts about 3,000 books published between 1600 and 1850, many of them bearing childish scrawls and dogeared pages. Among the books were a moth-eaten first American edition of "Little Goody Two Shoes," a 1780 Bible no bigger than a man's thumb, New England primers, books with paper dolls and collections of fairy tales, along with standbys like "Robinson Crusoe" and "Alice in Wonderland."         "The wonderful thing about this kind of collecting," Mrs. Ries once said, "is that you are giving life to books that otherwise would have rotted away in an attic somewhere."         Born in Frankfurt, Mrs. Ries received a law degree from the University of Frankfurt and arrived in Forest Hills with her husband in the late 1930's. She did not practice law but joined her husband in a window-display business. Together, they worked at some of New York's most fashionable department stores.         Mrs. Ries is survived by her daughter, Dr. Jane Ries Pitt Socolow of Princeton, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Johana Harris, a pianist, composer and teacher and the widow of the composer Roy Harris, died on June 5 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 82.         Mrs. Harris, whose original name was Beula Duffey, was born in Ottawa on Dec. 31, 1912. In the early 1920's she studied with Henry Puddicombe, a student of Liszt, and at his suggestion she moved to New York in 1924 to study with Ernest Hutcheson at the Juilliard School. A year later, at the age of 17, she joined the Juilliard faculty as an assistant.         She married Roy Harris in 1937, and it was his idea to change her first name to Johana, in tribute to Johann Sebastian Bach.         Mrs. Harris began recording for RCA Victor soon after her marriage, and immediately caught the attention of the record world with the first recording of the difficult Busoni arrangement of the Bach Chaconne. She also recorded most of Beethoven's solo and chamber works, works by her husband, by Schoenberg, Debussy and Piston, and the Ginastera Piano Sonata, which was composed for her in 1952. All told, she made more than 100 recordings.         She was a member of the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles until 1993, and continued to perform until April 1994.         Mr. Harris died in 1979. Mrs. Harris is survived by her second husband, Jake Heggie of San Francisco; two sons, Shaun Harris of Livermore, Calif., and Dan Harris of Indio, Calif; three daughters, Patricia Connelly of Santa Monica, Calif., Maureen Forman of Palm Desert, Calif., and Lane Murray of Tahoe City, Calif., and a brother, Norman Duffey of Lakeland, Fla.       
         Dr. Beatrix T. Gardner, a psychologist who with her husband, Dr. R. Allen Gardner, taught a chimpanzee sign language in the 1960's and the 1970's, died while traveling with her husband in Padua, Italy, on June 5. She was 61 and lived in Reno.         Reached yesterday at the University of Nevada in Reno, where he and his wife had worked as a team, her husband said the cause of death was a central nervous infection. He reported her death this week.         In the 1970's the couple announced that by raising a chimpanzee, Washoe, in the manner of a human child they had taught the ape to communicate using signs similar to those widely used by deaf human beings.         Since then, other researchers have also reported success in training chimpanzees to communicate without depending on speech, as by pushing specific buttons on a keyboard. At the time of the Gardner announcement, Dr. Peter R. Marler of Rockefeller University termed their work "brilliant and exciting."         That such animals actually learned a "language" has, however, been challenged. Among the skeptics is Dr. Herbert S. Terrace, a Columbia University psychologist, who has argued that his chimpanzee experiments have shown that an ape cannot, in any meaningful way, connect "words" into sentences.         Beatrix Tugendhut Gardner was born on July 13, 1933, in Vienna and was living in Poland at the time of the Nazi invasion. The family escaped to Brazil and lived for six years in a suburb of Sao Paulo before moving to the United States.         Dr. Gardner, whose first name was sometimes written Beatrice,earned a bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College and a master's degree at Brown University. She received a doctorate in zoology at Oxford University in England in 1959. She studied the stickleback, a fish whose male builds a nest for his mate. She returned to the United States and taught at Wellesley College, where she met Dr. Gardner, who was studying rats.         They learned of the adverse behavioral effect on rhesus monkeys reared in isolation and ultimately decided to investigate the role of parent-child relationships in the upbringing of chimpanzees. They married in 1961, moved to the University of Nevada in 1963, and in 1966 began trying to teach Washoe, a 10-month-old female ape, to use signals from Ameslan, the American Sign Language.         In 1967, when Washoe was 15 months old, they reported early results to a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York. They said Washoe had learned signs for hundreds of words.         The Gardners reported that the chimpanzee created expressions like "water birds" for a pair of swans and "open flower" to gain admittance to a flower garden. Washoe even seemed to be teaching sign language to a young companion. The Gardners did similar tests with four more chimpanzees: Moja, Pili, Tatu and Dar.         Skeptics suggested that these claims could be a product of inadvertent coaching or wishful thinking.         Other than her husband, Dr. Gardner had no immediate survivors.         But the chimpanzee project continues. Washoe just celebrated her 30th birthday. She lives in Ellensburg, Wash., at the Chimpanzee and Human Communications Institute, said Deborah Fouts, who with her husband, Roger, is co-director of the institute.       
         Lana Turner, who built a successful movie career on her first screen appearance as a teen-age "sweater girl," died on Thursday. She was 75 and lived in Los Angeles.         "She just took a breath and she was gone," her daughter, Cheryl Crane, was quoted as saying in Daily Variety, a trade newspaper. Miss Turner, who had been treated for throat cancer, apparently died of natural causes, a police spokeswoman, Ramona Baety, confirmed to The Associated Press.         Miss Turner was discovered in 1937 by a reporter as she sipped a soda in a Hollywood ice cream parlor while cutting a secretarial class at her high school. The encounter led to her first film role, in "They Won't Forget." Wearing a skintight sweater and skirt, she sauntered along a street, spoke not one line, was murdered in the first reel and began a quick climb to stardom.         Her best performance was that of an unfulfilled wife who persuades a drifter, played by John Garfield, to kill her husband in the screen adaptation of James M. Cain's gritty novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946). Other major roles were a rebellious student in "These Glamour Girls" (1939), a shallow performer in "Ziegfeld Girl" (1941) and an alcoholic actress in the thrall of a megalomaniac Hollywood producer (Kirk Douglas) in "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952).         Recalling "The Bad and the Beautiful," John Houseman, the producer, said he and Vincente Minnelli, the director, had agreed Miss Turner "was capable of brilliant individual scenes, but seemed to lack the temperament or the training to sustain a full-length performance."         "This made our episodic film just right for her," Mr. Houseman said.         Mr. Minnelli recalled using "many ruses and subterfuges" to extract a major performance from Miss Turner, adding, "As she got more into the picture her nervousness disappeared, and she effectively made the character's transition from tramp to glamour queen."         The actress, a star at MGM for 17 years, was a quintessential product of the Hollywood studio system. She recalled in 1969: "It was all beauty and it was all power. Once you had it made, they protected you; they gave you stardom. The ones who kept forging ahead became higher and higher and brighter and brighter and they were stars. And they were treated like stars. We had the best."         Her stormy personal life, peppered by many marriages and publicized romances, was as lurid as many of her films, but her identity as a sex symbol served to insulate her career from scandal's consequences. The most sensational incident occurred in 1958 when her lover, the reputed mobster Johnny Stompanato, threatened to disfigure her and was stabbed to death with a carving knife by Miss Crane, who was 14 at the time. A jury exonerated Miss Crane with a finding of justifiable homicide.         Miss Turner was born on Feb. 8, 1920, in Wallace, Idaho, and was named Julia Jean Mildred Frances Turner. Her father, John, was a miner. The family soon moved to San Francisco, where the Turners separated and Mr. Turner was mugged and murdered. Mildred Turner became a beautician and moved to Los Angeles, where the young Julia lived for a while in a foster home before returning to her mother.         Her discovery in a soda shop led to an interview with Mervyn LeRoy, the director and producer, who advised her to chose a catchy first name and began guiding her career. She chose Lana and began appearing in films, including "Love Finds Andy Hardy" (1938), "Calling Dr. Kildare" (1939) and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1941). She studied with a dramatic coach and soon co-starred successfully with such leading MGM actors as Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable and Robert Taylor.         Her acting was often barely passable, but she was convincing in love scenes and in some melodramas.  Miss Turner was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 for her portrayal of a neurotic mother in the film adaptation of Grace Metalious's novel "Peyton Place." In many later movies, including remakes of "Imitation of Life" (1959) and "Madame X" (1966), she played heroines racked by sacrifice and suffering.         On television, her most ambitious efforts were "The Survivors" (1970), a lavish prime-time soap opera based on the Harold Robbins novel about a sordid banking family, and "Falcon Crest" (1982-83), a series about a rich and greedy winery-owning family. She also toured in several plays, including the comedy "Forty Carats."         Miss Turner's 1982 memoir, "Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth," focused on her eight marriages and many romances. The memoir also recalled a suicide attempt, two abortions, three stillbirths, alcoholism and her religious awakening in 1980.         Miss Turner was married to and divorced from Artie Shaw, the band leader; Stephen Crane, a restaurateur (they were married and divorced twice); Bob Topping, a sportsman; Lex Barker, an actor whose roles included Tarzan; Fred May, a businessman and rancher; Robert P. Eaton, a businessman, and Ronald Dante, a nightclub hypnotist.         Her daughter is her only survivor. More Than Just A Pretty Figure         Lana Turner made her debut as a pinup girl, but went on to establish her acting credentials in such films as "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "Peyton Place." Here are some of the films in which she appeared. They Won't Forget 1937  Love Finds Andy Hardy 1938  Ziegfeld Girl 1941  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1941  Honky Tonk 1941  Johnny Eager 1942  Slightly Dangerous 1943  The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946  Green Dolphin Street 1947  Cass Timberlane 1947  The Three Musketeers 1948  A Life of Her Own 1950  The Bad and the Beautiful 1953  Peyton Place 1957  Imitation of Life 1959  By Love Possessed 1961  Madame X 1966  Bittersweet Love 1976  Witches' Brew 1978         Correction:  July 20, 1995, Thursday         An obituary on July 1 about Lana Turner referred incorrectly to her first role, in the 1937 film "They Won't Forget." The role was not large, but Ms. Turner did speak a few lines.       
         Louise Reinhardt Smith, a discerning collector of modern art and a prized supporter of the Museum of Modern Art since 1957, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Ms. Smith was one of the last of the strong-willed and independent-minded collectors whose activity was indispensable to the Museum of Modern Art at a time when there was still much new ground to be broken for its core collections.         Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, said yesterday: "Louise Smith brought to art a real, true love. She cared nothing for the social status or the public attention that it could bring. The only people she wanted around her were those who felt for art the way she did.         "Disregarding the safe and the sure, she was drawn to the tough and the difficult in art. Living with the tough pictures in her collection -- the redoubtable Picasso 'Woman Dressing Her Hair' of 1940, for one -- she developed over the years a friendship with them that was deeply moving to witness".         Mrs. Smith's many gifts to the Museum of Modern Art are the subject of an exhibition, "Masterworks From the Louise Reinhardt Smith Collection," which opened at the museum on May 4 and runs through Aug. 22. With the exception of two paintings -- one by Claude Monet, the other by Georges Braque -- that she bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, everything in the show will now be part of the Modern's permanent collection. Matisse, Degas, Kandinsky and Seurat are among the major artists represented in the exhibition.         Louise Reinhardt Smith was born in Dallas on March 14, 1904. The daughter of Sidney Reinhardt and Alice Blum Reinhardt, she attended Washington University and the College of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. In 1964, at the age of 60, she obtained her bachelor's degree from New York University.         For many years she wrote short stories for Ladies' Home Journal and other publications and in 1945 received the O. Henry Award. During her marriage to Bertram Smith, an investment broker in New York City, she kept registered Guernsey cows at the couple's farm in the Berkshires. After her husband's death, she began her long association with the Museum of Modern Art and its international council. She was made a trustee of the museum in 1965 and a trustee for life in 1993.         She is survived by a daughter, Ann Smith, and two grandsons, Bertram and Nicholas Nikola; all of Patterson, N.Y., and a sister, Alice Harrington of San Diego.       
         Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London. She was 53 and had homes in London, Santa Monica, Calif., and Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was breast cancer, said John Taylor Williams of Palmer & Dodge, the family's legal counsel in Boston.         Margaret Keswick Jencks hailed from a family that has lived and done business in China for nearly 140 years. She was born in Cowhill, Scotland, but spent much of her early life in post-revolutionary China.         She became known in the United States with the appearance of her book "The Chinese Garden" (1978), which was richly embellished by her own photography.         "Miss Keswick's is no ordinary garden tour," a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, "but a first-rate job of intellect, intelligently illustrated."         The book was reissued in paperback by St. Martin's Press in 1986 and remains in print.         Miss Keswick's father, Sir John Keswick, was a major trader at the head of the Scottish company Jardine Matheson. He spoke Chinese and became a trusted friend of Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong's most influential advisor.         In 1982, she edited "The Thistle and the Jade," a history of Jardine Matheson on its 150th anniversary. She also contributed to the "Oxford Garden Companion" and to books by her husband, Charles Alexander Jencks, a post-modernist architect and professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Architecture.         For many years she was the chairwoman of the Keswick Foundation, based in Hong Kong. She established the first cancer hospice there and extended the foundation's work to China. Most recently she created a cancer-care center in Edinburgh, where she was undergoing hospital treatment.         She was educated at Oxford University, where she studied Middle English, and at the Architectural Association in London. After "The Chinese Garden" was published, she lectured widely in the United States.         She was also in demand as a garden designer, collaborating with Frank Gehry, the architect, and Claes Oldenburg, the artist.         She is survived by her husband; a son, John; a daughter, Lily Clare; two stepsons, Cosmo and Justin Jencks, all of London, and her mother, Clare Lady Keswick of Portrack, Scotland.       
         Nell Michel Sawyer, a volunteer for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and other New York institutions, died on Monday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. A lifelong resident of Manhattan and Southampton, she was 50.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Sawyer's husband, David H. Sawyer, a media and political consultant, died at 59 on July 2 while under treatment for a brain tumor.         Mrs. Sawyer, a graduate of Briarcliff College, was the daughter of Barbara and Clifford Michel, an investment banker and senior partner in Loeb, Rhoades & Company and Kuhn Loeb & Company.         She was a board member of the American Ballet Theater. She was also a past chairwoman of the special projects committee at Sloan-Kettering and a longtime volunteer at the Buckley, Taft and Episcopal schools.         She is survived by three sons, Andrew McFarland, Gavin McFarland and Luke Sawyer, all of Manhattan; a brother, Clifford Michel of Gladstone, N.J., and a sister, Julienne Michel of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Virginia Mae Morrow, the Colorado woman whose hypnosis-induced recollections created a sensation in the 1950's, died on July 12 at a hospice outside Denver. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Richard, said.         According to Mrs. Morrow's own recollections, she had died before, after falling down a flight of stairs in Ireland in 1864, when she was known as Bridey Murphy.         Whether Mrs. Morrow really had a past life as Bridey Murphy, or even if there was a Bridey Murphy who lived the life Mrs. Morrow so vividly described in a thick Irish brogue during in taped hypnotic sessions in 1952 and 1953, has been the subject of intense emotional debate for more than four decades.         The debate began when her story was first told in articles by William J. Barker in The Denver Post in 1954, and it engaged a far wider audience when "The Search for Bridey Murphy" was published by Doubleday in 1956 and made into a movie the same year.         The book was by Morey Bernstein, the amateur hypnotist who had elicited the recollections in Pueblo, Colo. It became a best seller and was reissued in 1965 with additional material by Mr. Barker, but has been out of print for several years.         Whether Mrs. Morrow's account was dismissed out of hand or accepted as proof of reincarnation, Bridey Murphy became a 1950's phenomenon rivaling the Hula-Hoop. There were Bridey Murphy parties ("come as you were") and Bridey Murphy jokes (parents greeting newborns with "Welcome back").         The book triggered an interest in reincarnation and the use of hypnosis to regress a subject to early childhood, and perhaps beyond. It also spawned efforts to debunk Mrs. Morrow's recollections.         The notion that the book was an out-and-out hoax never gained much credence for several reasons. Mr. Bernstein, for example, was a wealthy and highly respected Pueblo businessman who had been experimenting with hypnosis for years.         His hypnosis sessions with Mrs. Morrow, which began on a lark after a party, were conducted in front of respected witnesses who vouched for the apparent authenticity of Mrs. Morrow's regression.         Also, Mrs. Morrow, then a 27-year-old mother of two known as Ginny Tighe, seemed an entirely guileless subject. She insisted that her real name not be used in the book, which called her Ruth Simmons, and then shunned virtually every opportunity to cash in on the Bridey Murphy phenomenon.         Efforts to debunk Bridey Murphy focused on the assumption that her detailed recollections an Irish life a century earlier were simply an outpouring of long-forgotten childhood memories.         In the 1965 edition, Mr. Barker took on the debunkers point by point. Yes, for example, as a child in Chicago Mrs. Morrow had lived across the street from a woman named Bridey (a common diminutive of Bridget), but so what? Mrs. Morrow said she had never known the woman's first name.         As for the visiting aunt of Scotch-Irish extraction who supposedly regaled her with tales from Ireland, the woman was born in New York and had no special interest in Ireland, and Mrs. Morrow was 18, not an impressionable toddler, when she was around.         Mrs. Morrow, whose original name was Reese, was born in Madison, Wis., on April 27, 1925, and raised by an aunt and uncle in Chicago. After studying at Northwestern University, she went with a friend to Denver, where she got a job and met her first husband, Hugh Tighe, who was later transferred to Pueblo.         They later moved back to the Denver area and were divorced.         Whatever the explanation of her highly detailed recollections, the one person who seemed immune to the debate was Mrs. Morrow.         As for all the fuss she had kicked up, she once said, "If I had known what was going to happen I would never have lain down on the couch."         In addition to her husband, of Englewood, Colo., Mrs. Morrow is survived by the three children from her first marriage, Marilou Butler of Valdosta, Ga., Nanci Lee of Hong Kong and Teri Francis of San Jose, Calif.; two stepchildren, Pam Zimmer of El Cajon, Calif., and Randy Morrow of Littleton, Colo., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Susan McAllister Swap, an educator and writer who focused on involving parents in their children's schools, died last Thursday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 50.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         Dr. Swap joined the faculty of Wheelock College in Boston in 1977 and taught courses in child development, special education, consultation and parent studies. A past chairwoman of the department of professional studies, she was a professor of education and psychology.         Most recently she directed the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, and the Center on College-School-Community Partnerships, two research programs at Wheelock.         She wrote articles about home-school partnerships and promoting the academic success of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Her books in print are "Managing an Effective Interview Program" (Teachers College, 1984), "Parent Involvement and Success for All Children: What We Know Now" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), "Schools Reaching Out and Success for All Children: Two Case Studies" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), and "Developing Home-School Partnerships: From Concept to Practice" (Teachers College, 1993).         Born in Bridgeport, Conn., she graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College and earned her Ph.D. in education and psychology at the University of Michigan. She taught at Tufts University before moving to Wheelock.         Dr. Swap is survived by her husband, Walter; a son, Clifford; a daughter, Alison, all of Winchester; her parents, John and Pauline McAllister of Fairfield, Conn.; two sisters, Joan Howard of Winterville, Ga., and June McAllister of Stratford, Conn., and a brother, Jef McAllister of Great Falls, Va.       
         Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a philanthropist and widow of Samuel Bronfman, founder of the Seagram Company, died yesterday at her home in Montreal. She was 98.         At her death, she was honorary president of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation, which supports a variety of charitable and community causes. A patron of the arts, she and her husband founded the Samuel Bronfman Collection of Canadian Art. She created a special fund for the Montreal Musem of Fine Arts to encourage young artists through the purchase of their work.         She was active in many organizations, including Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, the National Council of Jewish Women and the Organization for Rehabilitalation through Training.         Born in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, she studied at Havergal Ladies' College in Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba before marrying Mr. Bronfman in 1922. Two years later, the couple moved to Montreal, where Mr. Bronfman opened his first small distillery and built the company into a beverage and distilled spirits empire.         Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a daughter, Phyllis Barbara Lambert of Montreal; two sons, Edgar M. of Manhattan, the chairman of Seagram, and Charles R. of Montreal, co-chairman; 11 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1971.       
         Dr. Ethel Emerson Wortis, a physician long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at the San Simeon Nursing Home in Greenport, L.I. A former resident of New York City, she was 93 and lived in Southold, L.I.         For nearly three decades, she was associated with the Women's City Club of New York, holding various offices, including that of president in the 1950's. She was a past president of the Women's Medical Association of New York City and was active in the League of Women Voters, the Women's Prison Association and the Society of Friends.         Dr. Wortis was born in New York City, the daughter of Dr. Haven Emerson, a former City Commissioner of Health. She graduated from Radcliffe College and, in 1927, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.         Early in her career, she worked as a doctor at the Bronxville School in Bronxville, N.Y. She was later visiting physician at Goldwater Memorial Hospital, on Roosevelt Island, and, in the 1970's, a doctor in the Suffolk County Outreach Unit's mobile health clinic. She retired just over 10 years ago.         Dr. Wortis is survived by two sons, Michael, of Burnaby, British Columbia, and Ethan, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Ruth Cooke of Kennett Square, Pa.; a brother, John H. Emerson of Arlington, Mass., and four grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. S. Bernard Wortis, died in 1969 after 35 years of marriage.       
         Margot Wittkower, one of the first women to practice interior design in Europe and the widow of the art historian Rudolf Wittkower, died on July 3 at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Mrs. Wittkower, whose original name was Margot Holzmann, was born in Berlin in 1902. After establishing herself as a designer in Berlin, she left for London with her husband in the 1930's. She continued her work there, specializing in apartment interiors and furniture design. The Wittkowers were especially drawn to neo-Palladian architecture, and she eventually became an authority on the subject.         She also collaborated with her husband on a number of books and articles and was co-author, with him, of two books: "Born Under Saturn" (1963) and "The Divine Michelangelo" (1964).         She is survived by a grandson and two great-grandchildren.       
         Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala. By her own reckoning she was about 85.         When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.         Mrs. Logan, the 14th of 16 children, was born on a farm in Marengo County, outside Sweet Water, about 120 miles north of Mobile.         On the surface, her life was little different from those of other black women of her era in southern Alabama. As a child she picked cotton, sewed and ironed to make money for her family. And for all her infectious optimism and perpetual good cheer, even as a "granny," as midwives were known in the South, Mrs. Logan, the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, was hardly unique.         In 1910, about half of the births in the United States were assisted by midwives, and the percentage was far higher in the rural south. Their clients were generally so poor that even Mrs. Logan, who delivered virtually every child born in the predominantly black Mobile suburb of Prichard from 1931 to 1984, had to supplement her income by working as a maid.         What ultimately set Mrs. Logan apart was not her work, but her compelling sense that hers was a story that had to be told. Or, as she put it, "I just got so much experience in here that I just want to explode."         Although she was barely literate, Mrs. Logan said she was so determined to tell it she would be prepared to "scratch it out" herself.         That proved unnecessary when a family she worked for introduced her to Katherine Clark, a young Harvard graduate who came to Mobile in 1984 to teach English at the University of South Alabama and is now a professor of English at the University of New Orleans.         "As soon as I met her, I knew there was a book in her," Professor Clark said yesterday, recalling that she had taped 100 hours of Mrs. Logan's recollections before editing them into what became "Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story" (Dutton, 1989).         The book, still in print as a Plume paperback, was widely praised both for its vivid accounts of Mrs. Logan's life told in her distinctive vernacular and for her unflinchingly optimistic spirit in the face of pervasive adversity.         "Motherwit" made Mrs. Logan something of a folk hero, and two years ago she was represented along with Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Frank, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Joan Didion and other feminist luminaries in "The Norton Book of Women's Lives" (Norton, 1993).         Although lay midwives were outlawed by the state of Alabama in 1976, Mrs. Logan had attained such stature in Mobile that she was allowed to continue her practice under a permit from local authorities until 1984, when she received an abrupt notice telling her there was no longer a need for her services.         Mrs. Logan, who had delivered babies for almost two decades before receiving a state license in 1949, retired from her profession, but refused to abandon her calling. Despite all the advances in medical services to the poor, she knew that midwives were too often not the alternative to hospitals, but to husbands.         "They're not going to stop me from doing the gift that God give me to do," she said. "I don't be going there on no license. I be going there as a friend to help that husband deliver his baby."         Mrs. Logan, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Roosevelt Logan; a son, Johnnine Watkins of Moss Point, Miss; a sister, Louise Blackman of Pensacola, Fla.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Sylvia Weinberger, who used a sprinkling of matzoh meal, a pinch of salt and a dollop of schmaltzmanship to turn chopped liver into a commercial success, died on July 23 at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 89 and had lived in Boca Raton, Fla.         Mrs. Weinberger started making chopped liver for a luncheonette she and her husband, Irving, had opened in 1944 on the Grand Concourse at 169th Street in the Bronx. She ended up presiding over a $2 million-a-year operation as the proprietor of the semi-eponymous Mrs. Weinberg's Chopped Liver. She once said her name had been shortened because of typographical necessity when her first labels were printed: "My whole name wouldn't fit."         According to her son Richard, Mrs. Weinberg's had become the leading brand of chopped liver at kosher counters from New York to Chicago by the time she retired in 1989. But when it began, it was all Mrs. Weinberger could do to make it acceptable on the Grand Concourse.         At that time, store-bought chopped liver was almost an oxymoron, something to be smuggled home in a plain brown wrapper because no self-respecting Jewish homemaker was likely to admit that she did not have enough bedrock mother love or culinary skills to make it herself.         "I used to give it away," Mrs. Weinberger once said.         Never mind that chopped liver is the metaphorical butt of a Jewish retort ("What am I, chopped liver?"). In many Jewish homes, it is both a staple and a delicacy, one whose proper preparation has been described as the culinary test that divides Jewish moms from Jewish mothers.         Mrs. Weinberger's version apparently passed the test. After much wheedling and cajoling by Mrs. Weinberger, her chopped liver caught on -- so much so, Mrs. Weinberger once recalled, that when she put up a sign, "Mrs. Weinberger's chopped liver with a smile," "People used to say, 'Keep the smile, just give me the liver.' "         As the product became more popular, Mr. Weinberger started soliciting supermarkets in the Bronx. But when the first big order came in, for two cases, his wife was somewhat unprepared.         "We didn't have any boxes or cases," she said. "We delivered the individual containers in plastic bags."         Mrs. Weinberger, a Hungarian refugee, came to the United States in 1937 with two young sons to join her husband. She helped support the family by working as a seamstress while her husband worked in a laundry until they had saved enough to buy the luncheonette.         They sold it in 1955 to manufacture chopped liver full time. Other kosher products, all based on Mrs. Weinberger's recipes, were later added to the Mrs. Weinberg's Food Products line. The family sold the manufacturing company, but Mr. Weinberger continues to be the distributor.         In addition to Richard, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., Mrs. Weinberger is survived by another son, Sidney, of Boca Raton, and six grandchildren.         Correction:  August 3, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Sylvia Weinberger, who founded Mrs. Weinberg's Chopped Liver, misstated the given name of one of her sons. He is Fred Weinberger, not Richard.       
         Gail Beckenstein Sovern, a former investment analyst for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and legal librarian for the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, died on Tuesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 39 and lived in Kew Gardens, Queens.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Jeff Sovern. She was the daughter-in-law of Michael I. Sovern, president emeritus of Columbia University.         Ms. Sovern graduated from Brandeis University. She received a master's degree from Columbia's School of Library Service and an M.B.A. from New York University.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Murray and Shirley Beckenstein of Bellevue, Wash.; two daughters, Lindsay Madeline and Melanie; and a sister, Randi Fisher of London, Ont.       
         Jolie Hammer Kinsolving, a government affairs adviser and a former deputy borough president of Manhattan, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. A resident of the Upper East Side, she was 62.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She went to work for City Council President Sanford Garelik in 1970, often representing him on the Board of Estimate. Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton named her his deputy in 1974.         In 1978, she became an aide to Robert F. Wagner Jr., then chairman of the City Planning Commission and later deputy mayor. Since leaving government in 1985, she worked for the Manhattan law firm of Rosenman & Colin.         She is survived by her husband, Charles M. Kinsolving Jr.; a son, Ronald Hammer of Darien, Conn.; a brother, Dr. Richard Brockman of Manhattan; a sister, Susan Brockman of Manhattan; her stepmother, Elizabeth Brockman of Manhattan, and one grandson. Her marriage to Gordon Hammer ended in divorce.       
         Marcia Cayne, president of the Association of Reform Zionists of America and a member of the Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations, died on Saturday at Tarzana Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 57 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, the association said.         Born Marcia Liebert in Brooklyn, Ms. Cayne moved to Southern California in 1970 and became active in the Zionist association on the local level in 1981, shortly after it was formed. She was elected president of the organization's Pacific-Southwest Region in 1987 and president of the association in 1993.         The association has chapters in more than 600 Reform synagogues and promotes Reform activities in Israel. It seeks equality for all Jewish denominations in Israel, where religious life has traditionally been dominated by strict Orthodox Judaism.         Ms. Cayne was associated with many Jewish causes. She was a trustee and member of the executive committee of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and was active in groups like the World Zionist Organization and the American Zionist Movement.         She was a delegate to the World Zionist Congress in 1987 and 1992 and was chairwoman of several Congress committees. She was also a member of the Zionist General Council.         Not long after her election as president, she became a leading defender of a gay synagogue in New York, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, which the American Zionist Youth Foundation suddenly shut out of the 1993 Salute to Israel Parade. She called the exclusion "a shameful surrender to the forces of right-wing orthodoxy" that had diminished the cause of Jewish unity.         The congregation and its supporters among Reform organizations celebrated Israel's independence separately in a midtown synagogue that year.         Ms. Cayne is survived by her husband, Maurice Cayne; a daughter, Naomi Finerman of San Rafael, Calif., and a brother, David Liebert of Carlsbad, Calif.       
         Carol Fox Sulzberger, the wife of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, and an active volunteer with foundations and social-service organizations, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, L.I. She was 68.         The cause of her death was cancer.         Mrs. Sulzberger was a director of the New York City Police Foundation. At one time, she also served on the boards of the National Urban League, the New York Urban League, WAIF/International Social Service, the Girl Scouts of Greater New York and the Cooperative Education Association.         "She carried a very heavy schedule without talking a lot about it," a friend, Margaret Greenfield, said yesterday. "She did a lot of good works in a very quiet way."         Mrs. Greenfield and another friend of many years, Sydney Gruson, said friends would remember Mrs. Sulzberger as a woman who jealously guarded the time she spent with her family, her antiques hunting and her passion for the company and conversation of intimates. "She had a wry sense of humor," Mr. Gruson said. "And she was the most direct, honest woman I have ever known."         An avid reader of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger especially championed its coverage of fashion and the arts.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Estelle and David Fox. Mr. Fox had been president of Jay Thorpe, a New York women's specialty store that has since closed.         Educated at the Dalton School, she was a graduate of Goddard College in Vermont. In her youth, she spent a number of years with her family in Paris.         In addition to her husband of 39 years, she is survived by two daughters, Cathy, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Cynthia, of New York City, and two stepchildren, Karen, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Arthur Jr., the publisher of The Times, and seven grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family said that in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the New York City Police Foundation at 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10105.       
         Mary Polak Oenslager, a philanthropist who supported the city's cultural institutions and helped causes from women's health to the visually impaired, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         She endowed programs at several institutions that provide health care for women, like the Maternity Center Association on East 92d Street and Long Island College Hospital. The victim of an eye condition that left her nearly blind in midlife, she recovered her sight in one of the first cornea transplants and became a founder of Recordings for the Blind and a sponsor of blind university graduates.         Among her beneficiaries were the New York Philharmonic and its Free Concerts in the parks program, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History.         She was the widow of Donald M. Oenslager, a theatrical designer, who died in 1975. She and her husband gave their collection of prints of theaters, costumes and stage sets to the Pierpont Morgan Library, of which she was a Fellow in Perpetuity. She also was a Conservator of the New York Public Library.         Mrs. Oenslager is survived by her brother-in-law, Malcolm G. Chace Jr. of North Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Singer Kaplan, a pioneer in the field of sex therapy and founder of the country's first clinic for sexual disorders established at a medical school, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Kaplan was considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods.         She agreed with others in the field that sexual difficulties often had superficial origins. But she held that, in case an unconscious conflict lay at the root of the disorder, it could indicate deep emotional problems and require the therapist to resort to more analytical means.         Consequently, her approach was seen as psychosexual therapy, to distinguish it from sex therapy. And her arrival on the scene manifested the way psychoanalysts gradually adapted to new sex-therapy techniques.         Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice.         Working as a clinical professor of psychiatry, she became the founder, in 1970, of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, one of the country's most prominent psychiatric clinics and part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center complex. She remained its director until her death.         Born Helen Singer in Vienna on Feb. 6, 1929, she came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen in 1947. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Syracuse University in 1951 and earned a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1952. She got a Ph.D in psychology in 1955 at Columbia.         In 1959, she received her medical degree from New York Medical College, where she completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis in 1970.         She trained in clinical psychology at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics in Montrose, N.Y., and the Bronx, interned at Bronx Hospital and completed her training as a fellow of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College-Metropolitan Hospital Center.         There the first phase of her professional teaching career unfolded as she developed and coordinated a basic behavioral science program for psychiatric residents as well as a freshman medical course in psychiatry. She also developed and taught a required course in psychopharmacology.         From 1960 until she established her program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, she was an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and an associate attending psychiatrist at Metropolitan, Flower and B.S. Coler Hospitals. At Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center she also served as chief of psychosomatic and consultation services, co-director of the Behavior Therapy Unit, chairman of the Behavioral Science Teaching Program and director of a program for women residents with children.         She established new programs, including one to train the psychiatric and obstetrics-gynecology staff in human sexuality.         She was appointed a professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1970. Aside from directing her program at the Payne Whitney, she was in charge of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry and curriculum development until 1976.         Her human sexuality program included an outpatient clinic for the evaluation and treatment of psychosexual disorders. This generated clinical materials for postgraduate training courses for enrolled physicians and mental-health professionals. Dr. Kaplan was in charge of all education and training programs in human sexuality for Cornell medical students and psychiatric residents at the Payne Whitney.         Dr. Kaplan was credited with 110 publications and 127 lectures and presentations taking in the full range of her specialty.         Several of her books remain in print. These include "New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions" (Random House, 1974), "Disorders of Sexual Desires and Other New Concepts and Techniques in Sex Therapy" (Brunner-Mazel, 1979), "The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects" (Brunner, 1983), "The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy" (Brunner; 2d ed., 1987), "How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation" (Brunner, 1989), and, with Donald F. Klein, "Sexual Aversion, Sexual Phobias and Panic Disorder" (Brunner, 1987).         Dr. Kaplan is survived by her husband of 15 years, Charles P. Lazarus; two sons, Dr. Phillip Kaplan and Dr. Peter Kaplan, a daughter, Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio, all of the Upper East Side; a brother, Frank Singer of California, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 23, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Saturday of Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, omitted a survivor. She is Sofie Kane of Manhattan, Dr. Kaplan's mother.       
         Honeychile Wilder is dead, and if the "21" Club is not in actual mourning, the venerable former speak-easy on West 52d Street was closed for vacation last week when word got around that one of its most memorable former patrons had died on Aug. 11 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Her original name was Patricia Wilder, and at her death at the age of 76, she was officially known as Princess Alexander Hohenlohe. But from the moment she hit town in the 1930's and took New York by storm, the woman from Georgia who called everybody Honeychile was never called anything but that herself.         Even after she married the Austrian prince and became a celebrated international hostess, she was known as Princess Honeychile.         By her own account, within a day of her arrival in New York in 1934 she had been hired as a showgirl and was appearing with Bob Hope at the Palace Theater.         The gig led to a lifelong friendship, a number of appearances on the Bob Hope radio show, some forgettable movie roles, a series of unforgettable encounters at New York nightclubs and eventually to a series of celebrated liaisons, including a dalliance with King Farouk.         "She was a character," said her friend, Susie Schneider, who reported that the Princess, a longtime resident of Marbella, Spain, had died of lymphoma.         She may not have been the actual prototype of Truman Capote's "Breakfast at Tiffany's" heroine, Holly Golightly, as some said. If she was not, it was probably because Mr. Capote was only 16 years old in 1941 when Miss Wilder was charging New York night life with her special brand of electricity.         There was hardly a night the slender dark-haired beauty with the affecting Southern drawl couldn't be found at the Colony or the Monte Carlo for dinner, followed by stops at the Stork Club, the Cafe Pierre and El Morocco, and she had lunch at "21" so often that the bartender created a Honeychile drink in her honor (a whiskey sour made with honey rather than sugar).         As she later recalled those halcyon days, Conde Nast would send his limousine to take her to black-tie dinners at his town house; George Gershwin asked her to sit next to him at the piano while he was composing Porgy and Bess, and she used to go bar-hopping with Walter Winchell and his pal J. Edgar Hoover.         She had a well-chronicled affinity for millionaires, one that would probably have raised fewer eyebrows if their wives had been more understanding. One who apparently was not was Beverly Paterno, whose husband was the heir to a real estate fortune, calculated at the time as worth 63 million 1941 dollars.         What was said between the two women at the Cafe Pierre on the night of Feb. 22, 1941, was not recorded, but Honeychile's riposte made headlines the next day: she peppered her rival with a flurry of rights and lefts, then doused her with a pitcher of water.         Although she said she had attended a finishing school in Charlottesville, Va., there was some evidence that it did not ruin her speech patterns. As she once told an interviewer, "Everybody was my friend, but I wasn't in love with nobody."         That apparently changed when she met Prince Alexander. The Prince died 11 years ago.         After her husband's death, the Princess, who lived in a small house in Marbella (where a wealthy Hohenlohe cousin owns the Marbella Club) spent much of her time visiting rich friends around the world.         She is survived by a brother, Henry Wilder, of Macon, Ga.       
         Adele Simpson, an important player in the postwar fashion movement, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 91.         Mrs. Simpson took French couture and gave it an American ready-to-wear interpretation. Her color-coordinated dresses and jackets and well-cut coats in fine fabrics found favor among well-heeled women of her time in search of classic clothes that did not cost a month's rent.         Mrs. Simpson's popularity spanned more than three decades, from the late 1940's through the 1970's. Her coming of age as a designer mirrored the development of American sportswear, which was defining itself and growing in importance as the mass-market technology that followed World War II left its mark on fashion.         Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon and Barbara Bush were among those who wore her designs, and her collections were available in some of the nation's finest stores, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and Saks Fifth Avenue.         "She made clothes for ladies," said Helen O'Hagan, a fashion publicist who once worked at Saks. "They were beautifully made and designed. It wasn't advanced, but that wasn't who she was after."         Mrs. Simpson was born Adele Smithline in New York City, the fifth daughter of Latvian immigrants. In 1927, she married Wesley Simpson, a textile executive.         At 21, after completing design studies at Pratt Institute, she replaced her older sister Anna as head designer for Ben Girshel, then an important Seventh Avenue manufacturer. A few years later, she went to work for Mary Lee, another Seventh Avenue manufacturer. In 1949, she bought the company and renamed it Adele Simpson.         As was the practice of the day, she traveled regularly to Paris to gather inspiration and copy French designs.         Mrs. Simpson was the recipient of numerous fashion accolades, including the Coty American Fashion Critics award in 1947.         For the wedding of President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci, in 1966, Mrs. Simpson designed for the mother of the bride a wrinkle-resistant yellow silk street-length coat, matching princess-line dress and hat. This ensemble, with it color coordination and clean, practical lines, was typical of Mrs. Simpson's concept of fashion.         She continued designing into her 70's, retiring in 1985. Her daughter, Joan Raines, and son-in-law, Richard Raines, ran the business after her retirement. In 1991, the family sold the business to Barron Peters, a clothing company in Lowell, Mass., which has since filed for bankruptcy and discontinued the Adele Simpson line.         Mrs. Simpson's husband died in 1976.         In addition to her daughter, Joan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Simpson is survived by a son, Jeffrey, also of Manhattan, and three grandsons.       
         Alice Greenough Orr, who broke horses as a youngster on a Montana ranch, delivered mail through snowdrifts on horseback as a teen-ager and later reigned for two decades as the rodeo queen of the bronc riders, died on Sunday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 93 and a member of both the Cowboy and the Cowgirl Halls of Fame.         In a career that took her from the wilds of Montana to Madison Square Garden and the capitals of Europe, Mrs. Orr was always at home on a horse. If it was bucking, so much the better.         When she was a child growing up on a ranch near Red Lodge, Mont., her father regularly gave her wild horses, knowing that by the time they got tired of trying to dislodge his tenacious daughter, they would be tame enough for regular people to ride.         In time, her skill would lead to four world saddle bronc championships and make her a star attraction on rodeo tours in the United States, Australia and Europe.         Although bronc riding was her specialty, she and her little sister, Marge Henderson, excelled at virtually every rodeo event from trick riding to bull riding. Together with their brothers Bill and Turk, they became known as the Riding Greenoughs. Like Turk, a legendary bronc rider who died in June at the age of 89, Mrs. Orr also did occasional stunt work for the movies.         Her skill brought her considerable attention. On one European tour in the 1930's she had tea with the Queen of England, and, without benefit of sword, rode fighting bulls into Spanish arenas before dismounting and leaving them to the matadors.         Mrs. Orr, who once said she had been "born liberated," dropped out of school to take over a 35-mile rural mail route at the age of 14. She kept the route for three winters and two summers and had her heart set on a career as a forest ranger until the return of servicemen from World War I closed off such employment opportunities for women.         After the failure of her marriage to Ray Cahill, which produced two children, Mrs. Orr was working in a rooming house in 1929 when she read an advertisement for bronc riders for a wild west show, the precursor of modern rodeos.         She and her sister answered the advertisement and were hired on the spot.         Early competitors were sometimes shortchanged by tour operators, at least until 1936, when Mrs. Orr and others formed what is now known as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.         In the 1940's she and her second husband, Joe Orr, operated their own rodeos, with Mrs. Orr providing exhibitions of saddle bronc riding, a specialty that rodeo experts say requires so much more skill and finesse than bareback riding that it no longer exists as a competitive event on the women's rodeo circuit.         Mrs. Orr retired from rodeos in 1954, but continued to accept occasional movie assignments until she was 80. She climbed into the saddle for the last time in 1992 when she rode in a parade in Red Lodge, where few of those who lined the route could remember the time when it was a girl on horseback who delivered the mail.         In addition to her sister, also of Tucson, she is survived by a son, Jay Cahill of Grandview, Mo.; 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Niuta Titus, whose philanthropy fostered culture and medical research, died on Tuesday in Gstaad, Switzerland, while on vacation. Mrs. Titus, who lived in Manhattan, was 82.         With her husband, Roy V. Titus, the former chairman of the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics empire, who died in 1989, Mrs. Titus supported endeavors like the film program at the Museum of Modern Art, biochemistry at Duke University and ophthalmological research at the Wilmer Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.         She was the president of the Roy and Niuta Titus Foundation, an honorary trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, a director of the Children's Blood Foundation, president of the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem, a member of the international board of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and honorary director of the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which is devoted to the health, education and welfare of women and children.         Many film buffs in New York have pursued their passion at institutions supported by Mr. and Mrs. Titus. Among them were the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the Film Forum as well as the Museum of Modern Art. In 1976, at a time of pressing financial problems for the museum, Mr. Titus and his wife donated $1 million to renovate its 37-year-old auditorium and for its endowment. Six years later, the couple sponsored a second theater, and the auditoriums are named for them.         Despite her high-visibility projects, Mrs. Titus was not a public figure. She enjoyed the company of friends and, in particular, liked a good game of bridge.         She was a member of the Regency Whist Club and the Cavendish Club, a private bridge club, where she met Mr. Titus after she had been widowed twice. They were married in 1960. Twenty years later, they were both still playing bridge at the club.         Mrs. Titus was born in Lithuania, where she grew up. Before World War II, she lived in Paris with her first husband, Benno Slesin, the general manager for Europe for Warner Brothers.         She came to the United States in 1940, and after Mr. Slesin died in an airplane crash in 1947, she marriedBernard Miller, a cutlery manufacturer in England. He died in 1953.         Mrs. Titus is survived by two children of her first marriage, Louis E. Slesin of Manhattan, and Suzanne Slesin Steinberg of Manhattan, an assistant editor in the Home section of The New York Times; and three grandchildren.       
         Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, to which she gave dozens of paintings collected over the years by her and her second husband, Samuel A. Marx, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         The couple came to own what was among the most distinguished collections of modern art in private hands. The collection included the most outstanding collection of early works by Matisse outside Russia, the museum said.         Mrs. Schoenborn became a museum trustee in 1953 and served on the program and drawing comittees. She was a founding member of the museum's international council in 1954.         She was born in Denver. Her father was David May Sr., the founder of May Department Stores, who started his chain in Leadville, Colo. As a young woman, she hoped to study journalism at Columbia University but her father would not permit her to attend.         Forty-four of her paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in a 1965 exhibition, "The School of Paris: Paintings From the Florene May Schoenborn and Samuel A. Marx Collection." Mr. Marx, a successful Chicago architect, died in 1964.         Mrs. Schoenborn donated many important paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints to the museum. The core of her contributions consisted of five paintings by Matisse: "Moroccan Garden" (1912), "Woman on a High Stool" (1914), "Artist and Goldfish" (1914), "Variation on a Still Life by De Heen" (1915) and "The Moroccans" (1915).         The gallery showing Matisse works from the museum's permanent collection was named the Florene May Schoenborn Gallery in 1986.         Her first marriage, to Martin Straus, an advertising executive, ended in divorce. Her third husband, Wolfgang Schoenborn, a developer who helped to turn the old Pacific port of Acapulco into a fashionable resort, died in 1986.         She is survived by five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 1, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, misstated the number of paintings she gave to the museum. Her gifts included five paintings by Matisse and drawings, sculptures and prints by many other artists, not dozens of paintings.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Phyllis Brooks, a popular film and stage actress in the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in Cape Neddick, Me. She was 80.         Miss Brooks, a native of Boise, Idaho, started her career as an artist's model in New York, posing for the magazine illustrator James Montgomery Flagg and others. Hollywood discovered her in 1934 as the "Ipana toothpaste girl," and she appeared in Sidney Toler's Charlie Chan series and the Shirley Temple films "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Little Miss Broadway." Unhappy with her roles, she tried her luck on Broadway, and succeeded with the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber play "Stage Door" (1936) and the hit Ethel Merman musical "Panama Hattie" (1940).         Miss Brooks, who was engaged at one time to Cary Grant, married Torbert H. Macdonald, a wealthy former college football star and hero of World War II, in 1945. He and John F. Kennedy had been college roommates at Harvard.         The Macdonalds settled in Malden, Mass., where Mr. Macdonald was elected to Congress in 1954. He served 11 straight terms, until his death in 1976.         Miss Brooks was active in promoting her husband's political career and that of Kennedy, who was their elder son's godfather. While she declined to move to Washington, she was a frequent hostess on the social scene, especially after Kennedy became President.         She is survived by two sons, Torbert Jr., of York, Me., and Brian, of Salem, Mass.; two daughters, Laurie, of Everett, Mass., and Robin, of Kennebunk, Me.; a brother, Norman Brooks of Cushing, Me., and eight grandchildren.       
         Ida Lupino, an earthy, intelligent movie actress who created a luminous gallery of worldly wise villainesses, gangster's molls and hand-wringing neurotics, died on Thursday night at her home in Burbank, Calif. She was 77 years old.         Miss Lupino had cancer and had recently suffered a stroke, Mary Ann Anderson, her former secretary, said yesterday.         The actress was also celebrated for directing eight provocative and socially relevant feature films and scores of episodes of many long-running television series, including "The Untouchables," "Have Gun, Will Travel" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         In the course of more than 50 films, Miss Lupino was a spiteful Cockney in "The Light That Failed" (1939), a crazed wife in "They Drive by Night" (1940), a loyal girlfriend in "High Sierra" (1941), an escaped convict in "The Sea Wolf" (1941) and a steely murderer in "Ladies in Retirement" (1941).         In later roles, she was a depraved warden in "Women's Prison" (1955), a sob-sister columnist in "While the City Sleeps" (1956) and the world-weary mother of a rodeo star in "Junior Bonner" (1972). Vincent Canby of The New York Times called "Junior Bonner" "a superior family comedy" made to order for both Steve McQueen and Robert Preston, but wrote "the loveliest performance is that of Miss Lupino."         In the early 1950's, she directed and helped write successful low-budget movies on such sensitive issues as illegitimacy ("Not Wanted"), rape ("Outrage") and pathological murder ("The Hitch-Hiker").         On television, she regularly starred in a dramatic anthology, Four Star Playhouse, from 1952 to 1956. In 1957 and 1958 she produced "Mr. Adams and Eve," a situation comedy about married film stars, in which her co-star was Howard Duff, her third husband. Many of the episodes dealt comically with their real-life experiences.         Ida Lupino was born in London on Feb. 4, 1918, during a German zeppelin bombing. Her paternal forebears were traveling players and puppeteers in Renaissance Italy. Later generations migrated to England in the 17th century. Her father, Stanley Lupino, was a noted comedian, and her mother, Connie Emerald, was an actress who was also descended from a theatrical family. A cousin, Lupino Lane, was an internationally popular song-and-dance man.         As a child, she improvised and acted scenes with her younger sister, Rita, in a small theater their father had built for them in their London garden. Her roles included Juliet, Camille and even Hamlet. At the age of 13, she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At 15, she made her film debut in a Lolita-like role in "Her First Affaire." She made five more movies in Britain in 1933, then signed a contract with Paramount Pictures in Hollywood and played a dozen more sugary ingenues over the next five years.         The turning point came with "The Light That Failed," in which she forcefully played a vengeful prostitute who betrays an artist going blind (Ronald Colman). That performance and her next one, as a demented murderer in "They Drive by Night," won her a long-term contract at Warner Brothers.         Over the next decade, critics increasingly hailed Miss Lupino as one of the great film actresses. Her favorite role was in "Ladies in Retirement," as a stolid housekeeper who kills her overbearing employer so she can use the house as a sanctuary for her two insane sisters. The New York film critics honored her as the best actress of 1943 for her portrayal in "The Hard Way" of a ruthless woman who propels her younger sister to stardom and destroys everyone in her way.         Miss Lupino gracefully disguised the intense effort she put into shaping her roles, displaying an economy of motion and an ease in using precisely on-target gestures and intonation. She insisted she was not a born actress, saying: "I study and work hard. I take a script and mull over it and underline the bits I want to emphasize. When I go on the set, I know exactly what I want to do and how I want to do it."         In 1949, Miss Lupino and Collier Young, a movie executive and producer who was then her husband, founded Filmakers, an independent production company, for which she directed candid films with feminist themes. One of the most popular was "The Bigamist" (1953).         The energetic Miss Lupino called directing the most demanding work in films, requiring tactful but firm handling of many temperaments and giving clear instructions to a usually all-male, often skeptical crew. Though she spent many hours at what was then a man's calling, she was unstintingly feminine in bearing and manner, observing, "I'm not the kind of woman who can bark orders."         Miss Lupino was petite, standing only 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 112 pounds. She had auburn hair and violet eyes framed by half-inch-long lashes. Her leisure pursuits included skin diving, writing short stories and children's books, and composing music. One work, "Aladdin Suite," was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.         She was married to (and divorced from) the actor Louis Hayward (1938 to 1945) as well as Mr. Young (1948 to 1951). She and Howard Duff were married in 1951 and divorced in 1983. He died in 1990.         Miss Lupino is survived by a daughter, Bridget Duff, and a sister, Rita Lupino.       
         Gloria Wills Landes, a former Broadway showgirl who capped a brief, effervescent career by founding and directing an acclaimed school for aspiring teen-age actors and playwrights, died on Friday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 69.         Mrs. Landes was the director of the SUNY Youth Theater in Purchase, N.Y., until she became ill last year. She had breast cancer, her family said.         If Gloria Wills's days on Broadway had been a Busby Berkeley musical, she would have been the star's funny and bubbly best friend, the one who has her moments in the spotlight but gives up a promising career to marry a rich businessman.         Mrs. Landes's career lasted only three years, but by the time she left a Broadway-bound show in Philadelphia in 1948 to marry Jack Landes, a wealthy silver importer, she had something to tell her grandchildren.  Like hundreds of other stage-struck singers, dancers and actors who have passed through Broadway's revolving door over the years, she had a scrapbook proving that she had been a part of a great tradition.         She may have spent more time auditioning than performing, but she was a Brooklyn girl who could belt out a song, and her persistent auditions at least made an impression on Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers once said she had auditioned for every part in "Oklahoma!" except the villain, Jud Fry.  If she missed a week trying out for the part of Ado Annie, the "girl who can't say no," Hammerstein would ask if she had been sick.         She may not have been a star, but the critic Walter Kerr once called her "one of the funniest things on Broadway," and she had her share of brushes with destiny and Broadway cliches.         In 1945, for example, she was in the chorus of "Carousel" when she discovered new meaning in the old theater good-luck wish of "break a leg." A featured singer got sick, and her understudy, rushing in to replace her, fell down the dressing room steps and actually broke a leg. Mrs. Landes, then all of 19 years old, spent the next six weeks singing "You'll Never Walk Alone."         Then there was the birthday party for "Oklahoma!" She did a comic version of Agnes de Mille's famous second-act ballet that left Miss de Mille in stitches and persuaded Rodgers and Hammerstein to cast her as Beulah, the campus vamp, in the musical "Allegro" in 1947.         That led to a part in the revue "Make Mine Manhattan," with Sid Caesar, but Mrs. Landes, who had doubts about the part and her future in the theater, left the show in Philadelphia to accept what she decided was a better offer: to marry Mr. Landes and live happily ever after.         That is more or less what she did. Several months after she was married, Cole Porter asked her to be Bianca in "Kiss Me Kate," but she was pregnant by then with the first of her four sons.         Unlike many other short-term performers who end up in the suburbs, Mrs. Landes found a second act. After performing in summer stock, she established a school for teen-age performers that was absorbed by the State University of New York at Purchase, where she taught a generation of young actors and playwrights, including Matt Dillon.         Mrs. Landes's husband died in 1989. She is survived by her sons, Mark of Potomac, Md., Dan of Brooklyn, Robert of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Peter of San Rafael, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Herbery Wolfson of Wilmington, Del.       
         Brigid Brophy, a novelist, critic, essayist and crusader for myriad causes ranging from better royalty payments for writers to better treatment for animals, died on Monday at a nursing home in Lincolnshire, England. She was 66 and had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years.         Miss Brophy was the author of 4 plays, 7 novels and 14 other books, but she is just as well known for her most successful campaign, for lending rights for authors. In 1979, her efforts resulted in a law that for the first time allowed authors to receive royalty payments from the British Government every time their books were checked out of a public library.         But Miss Brophy also campaigned -- even from her sickbed -- for the rights of women, of prisoners and of animals. She was a vice president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, and no animal escaped her sympathy. She even became active in an anti-angling campaign, and at one point sent a letter to the fishing correspondent of The Daily Telegraph in which she compared anglers to "thugs who beat up old-age pensioners for fun" and quoted Lord Byron's remark that fishing was "the stupidest of pretended sports."         Brigid Antonia Brophy was born in 1929 in London, the only daughter of the Anglo-Irish novelist John Brophy. She was educated at St. Paul's Girls' School and later at Oxford, where she excelled as a scholar but was soon expelled because of drunken, raucous behavior. She was acting, she later wrote, "in the belief that I had more to learn by pursuing my personal life than from textual emendation, with the result that the authorities could put up with me for only just over a year.         "I came down at the age of 19 without a degree and with a consequent sense of nudity which I have never quite overcome."         In 1954, before she was even 30, she burst onto the literary scene when her novel "Hackenfeller's Ape," about an ape at the London Zoo and its increasingly close relationship to the professor observing its mating habits, won the Cheltenham Literary Festival First Prize for a first novel. Her novels are known for their imagination and acerbic wit, and include "The Snow Ball," in which the characters attend a ball dressed as figures from "Don Giovanni"; "Flesh," which she described as "an almost distressingly cold-blooded little story," and "In Transit," set, claustrophobically, in an airport transit lounge.         But she also developed a reputation as a sharp thinker and fierce intellectual who liked a good fight, and her nonfiction books tended to have provocative, often mischievous points of view. In 1967, for instance, she was one of the authors of "Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without," an attack on a number of classic books including "Jane Eyre," which was likened by the authors to "gobbling a jar-full of school-girl stick-jaw." She also championed the writing of Ronald Firbank in "Prancing Novelist" (1973), subtitled "A Defense of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank."         Miss Brophy, who spoke freely in her early years about her bisexuality and often referred to marriage as "an immoral institution," nonetheless married in 1954. Her husband, the art historian Michael Levey, shared her delight in literature and the arts. He became director of the National Gallery in 1973 and was knighted eight years later.         In a tribute to Miss Brophy in The Independent on Tuesday, her literary agent, Giles Gordon, described her as a "deeply shy, courteous woman" who wrote delightful thank-you letters and kept to rigorous standards in her work. "Woe betide the 'editor' who tried to rewrite her fastidious, logical, exact prose, change a colon to a semi-colon (or vice-versa), or try to spell 'show' other than 'shew,' slavish Shavian that Brophy was," Mr. Gordon wrote.         In 1979, Miss Brophy's physical problem was diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which steadily worsened until she was housebound and had to use a wheelchair. She remained at home, looked after by paid companions, friends and her husband, who in 1987 quit his job to help care for her. But she continued to work with all the energy her illness would allow. In 1987 she published "Baroque 'n' Roll," a collection of essays in which she outlined, with lucidity and detail, the debilitating toll her condition had taken on her. Eventually, her condition deteriorated so badly that she had to move into the nursing home where she died.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Kate.       
         Katharine B. Day, the widow of Clarence Day, author of "Life With Father" and other books, died on Aug. 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         After her husband's death in 1935, Mrs. Day acted as the technical adviser for the Broadway production of "Life With Father" in 1939 and contributed heavily to its sequel, "Life With Mother," in 1948. Both plays were created by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, working from Day's reminiscences of his youth in New York City in the 1880's. Mrs. Day also served as an adviser for the 1947 film adaptation of "Life With Father."         She is survived by a daughter, Wilhelmine; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Eileen Chang, a popular novelist and short story writer whose finely honed psychological studies and precise language won her acclaim as a giant of modern Chinese literature, was found dead on Friday in the Los Angeles apartment where she had lived as a virtual recluse. She was 74.         Friends said that Miss Chang, known to Chinese readers as Chang Ai-ling, had died of natural causes several days before her building manager discovered her body after becoming alarmed that she had not answered her telephone.         Miss Chang, a native of Shanghai, was at once a beloved figure who had a huge devoted following in Taiwan, Hong Kong and in other Chinese communities around the world and a lionized author whose works, particularly her early short stories, were hailed as classics by literary critics.         News of her death drew front-page tributes in Taiwan and Hong Kong.         "She was a rarity," said Dominic Cheung, a poet and professor of East Asian languages at the University of Southern California.         Had it not been for the political division between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, he said, she would have almost certainly won a Nobel Prize.         As it was, until recently her works had been suppressed in mainland China, largely because two of her most widely known novels, "Rice Sprout Song" (1954) and "The Naked Earth" (1956), both of which appeared in both Chinese and English, were unsparing in their criticism of Communists.         For all that, Miss Chang was largely apolitical in her life and in her works, many of them bitter love stories that captivated readers in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where several of her books and stories were made into movies. The films included "Love in a Fallen City" (1990), "The Rouge of the North" (1991) and "Red Rose, White Rose" (1995).         C. T. Hsia, a retired professor of Chinese at Columbia University who once called Miss Chang "the most gifted Chinese writer to emerge in the 40's," compared her favorably yesterday with such widely acclaimed writers as Katherine Mansfield, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty and especially Flannery O'Connor and Franz Kafka.         Like both O'Connor and Kafka, he said, she tended to be "a bit odd and lonely."         Loneliness was a theme of her life. According to her friends, Miss Chang's insights into human emotions, especially those of women in the throes of thwarted romance, were grounded in her experiences with a cruel father who abandoned her mother and her first husband, Hu Lan Cheng, a Chinese writer who collaborated with the Japanese in World War II and later betrayed Miss Chang with another woman.         Her second husband, Ferdinand Reyher, a friend of Bertold Brecht's whom she met at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, died in 1967.         Miss Chang, who was forced by the Japanese invasion to abandon her college education in Hong Kong, enjoyed a measure of popular success after returning to Shanghai, but her works were dismissed as mere romances until her 1943 novella, "The Golden Cangue" (named for a form of restraint resembling the stocks used in colonial America), established her literary reputation.         Miss Chang, who returned to Hong Kong in 1952 and moved to the United States three years later, was such a recluse that she refused to meet the steady stream of prominent editors who sought her out.         Even her editor in Taiwan had to communicate with her by fax, sometimes waiting days for a reply because she used a machine at a neighborhood grocery store.         Last year she was persuaded to accept a major literary award in Taiwan, but, typically, she refused to accept it in person.         Instead she sent a group of photographs of herself dating back to the 1930's but including one recent likeness in which she looked so improbably young that she took the precaution of posing with a newspaper showing the date.         There are no survivors.       
         Frances Webb Roosevelt, a portrait artist who was the mother-in-law of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 78 and lived on the Roosevelt estate, Sagamore Hill, in Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Roosevelt was the widow of President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Quentin Roosevelt.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said Ilene Hoffer, a spokeswoman for Governor Weld.         Mrs. Roosevelt was a native of Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1939. She married Quentin Roosevelt in England in April 1944, two months before her husband, an Army captain, participated in the D-Day invasion. During the war, Mrs. Roosevelt, a Red Cross worker, drew pictures of soldiers on postcards that they later sent home to their families.         After the war, the family moved to Shanghai and lived there until Quentin Roosevelt died in a plane crash near Hong Kong in 1948. Mrs. Roosevelt then moved with her children to Sagamore Hill.         A well-known portrait artist in Oyster Bay, Mrs. Roosevelt taught art at C. W. Post College in Brookville, L.I. During the late 1940's and early 1950's, she worked as a courtroom sketch artist for several newspapers and covered the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, the American diplomat who had been accused of spying for the Soviet Union.         Mrs. Roosevelt is survived by three daughters, Susan Roosevelt Weld of Boston, the wife of Governor Weld; Anna Curtenius Roosevelt of Chicago, and Alexandra Dworkin of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ann S. Belcher, an ear, nose and throat specialist who practiced in the same Manhattan building for more than two-thirds of a century, died at her home in Seattle last month at 100.         For 68 years, from 1924 to 1992, Dr. Belcher's office at 20 East 53d Street attracted patients ranging from neighborhood shop clerks to corporate executives, several generations of Rockefellers and Jacqueline Onassis.         "She believed in treating the whole person," said her daughter, Suzanne Bunzel, noting that her mother was known for the accuracy of her wide-ranging diagnoses beyond her specialty.         Dr. Belcher, whose maiden name was Seligman, was born in Keyport, N.J., on July 6, 1895, and began aiming for a medical career five years later, when she was impressed by two aunts, both physicians, who were visiting from Germany.         She received her undergraduate and medical degrees from Cornell, where she met her husband, Harold, a general practitioner who died in 1988.         Dr. Belcher always found time to indulge her passion for the stock market. Until she was stricken by a gastrointestinal infection two days before her death on Aug. 11, her daughter said, she called her broker every day.         Despite a recent interest in high-technology issues, her favorite was Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Warren E. Buffett, whose greeting on her 100th birthday in July included a request for a stock tip.         Beside Mrs. Bunzel of Los Angeles, Dr. Belcher is survived by another daughter, Kate Webster of Bainbridge Island, Wash., six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Katherine Locke, who appeared on Broadway and in films, died on Tuesday at her home in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 85.         Ms. Locke made her stage debut in 1928 in "The Joy of Serpents" at the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village. She followed that with bit parts in "Firebird" (with Judith Anderson), "Halfway to Hell" and "If a Body."         Her big break came when she was cast opposite John Garfield in Arthur Kober's 1937 Broadway comedy, "Having Wonderful Time." She went on to play Ophelia to Maurice Evans's Hamlet in 1938 and appeared with Franchot Tone and Lee J. Cobb in a 1940 adaptation of "The Fifth Column," Ernest Hemingway's play about the civil war in Spain.         Her screen credits include "The Seventh Cross" (1944), "The Snake Pit" (1948) and "People Will Talk" (1951).         She is survived by her husband, the writer and producer Norman Corwin; a daughter, Diane Corwin Okarski of Spokane, Wash., and a son, Anthony, of Thousand Oaks.       
         Helen K. Nearing, who with her husband, Scott Nearing, wrote about leaving the congested streets of Manhattan to find peace and happiness through hard work and self-sufficiency on a New England farm, died on Sunday in an automobile accident near her home in Harborside, Me. She was 91.         Mrs. Nearing, whose husband died at 100 in 1983, had continued to live alone in the farmhouse they built 40 years ago overlooking Penobscot Bay. She was killed when a car she was driving struck a tree, said Eliot Coleman, a friend who lives on a neighboring farm.         Between them, Mrs. Nearing and her husband wrote more than 50 books during their half-century of homesteading, including "Living the Good Life" and "Continuing the Good Life," written initially in pamphlet form and then published by Schocken in 1954 and 1970, respectively.         Although written shortly after the Depression, both books became primers for thousands of urbanites who dropped out of the corporate world in the early 1970's and headed for the quiet countryside.         Followers describe the Nearings as the "senior gurus" of the back-to-the-land movement.         "Materialism does not produce happiness," Mrs. Nearing told those who came to tour her Forest Farm and marvel that, in an age of mass communications, she still made do without radio or television.         "She gave in and had a telephone installed about 10 years ago so she could keep in touch with all her friends around the world," said Mr. Coleman, who with his wife, Barbara Damrosch, is host of a cable television series called "Natural Gardening."         A lifelong vegetarian, Mrs. Nearing also did not take aspirin or use a credit card. Instead, she helped to restore the soil of her farm, build a stone farmhouse and outbuildings and plant an organic garden. In her pantry, she filled barrels with flour and sugar, much like New England dwellers a hundred or more years before her.         "In November, the rafters in our big country kitchen are hung with braids of onions and shallots, with ears of dried corn, with drying herbs (mint, tarragon, thyme, parsley, celery, sage and lovage)," she once wrote in a letter to The New York Times.         "Of bottled canned goods in the kitchen cellar, we have 160 quarts of vegatable soup and tomato juice, 132 quarts of rose hips, 80 quarts of applesauce, 146 quarts of raspberries, and jars and jars of jam," she wrote.         Mrs. Nearing drew a parallel between the people who immigrated to New England in the 1700's and "the many young people of today who find no satisfactory way to exercise or develop their talents and interests in modern city or suburb."         "They are willing and eager to clear their land, build their homes, dig and cultivate their own gardens and subsist on their own work," she said. "They are finding out that it is possible to live daily self-sufficient lives even in the middle of the 20th century."         Believing in the adage "waste not, want not," she wrote about all her experiences, providing New Age homesteaders with 10- and 20-year projects leading toward "the good life."         "The Maple Sugar Book," which she wrote with her husband and which was published by Schocken in 1950, told not only of the art and history of sugaring but also of the practical details of sugar making.         Another primer, "Building and Using Our Sun-Heated Greenhouse," published in 1971 by Dutton and now out of print, told of how to grow vegetables year-round in New England without artificial heating.         Among the books that Mrs. Nearing wrote alone were "Wise Words on the Good Life" (Schocken, 1983) and "Simple Food for the Good Life" (Stillpoint, 1983), which she described as "an anti-cooking book that advocates fresh raw foods and minimal cooking."         Her latest work, to be published this month by Tilbury House, "Light on Aging and Dying," is a collection of quotations inspired by the death of her husband 12 years ago.         Mrs. Nearing, who was born in Ridgewood, N.J., graduated from Ridgewood High School, then traveled extensively aboard, studying the violin, which she gave up for gardening when she married Mr. Nearing.         The Nearings began their long journey in search of the good life in 1932, when Mr. Nearing, a professor of economics, left the academic world and moved far away from New York City and the Depression to the wilderness of Vermont, where they built their first farm.         Twenty years later, feeling crowded by a nearby ski lift and growing tourism, they headed for Maine.  They kept a car and a pickup truck but permitted no machines on the farm that were not run by human or animal power.         According to the Nearings' wishes, an education and retreat center is to be established on Forest Farm after their deaths. The nonprofit center, to be called the Good Life Center, is to be administered and financed in part by the Trust for Public Land of Boston, an organization that preserves rural sites and crafts.         The Social Science Institute, formed in 1953 to print political and economic pamphlets written by Mr. Nearing, will become part of the Good Life Center.         Mrs. Nearing is survived by a sister, Alice Vaughan of Dorset, Vt.; a niece, Barbara Tuttle, and a nephew, C. B. Vaughan, both of Dorset, and a stepson, Robert Nearing of Troy, Pa.         A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. on Sunday, Oct. 1, at the Brookville Community Center in South Brookville, Me.       
         Dorothy Robinson Kidder, a philanthropist who founded a program to feed the homeless while continuing her family tradition of support for the arts, died of cancer on Monday at her home in Washington, her family said. She was 78.         Mrs. Kidder was a great-granddaughter of Eben D. Jordan, the founder of the Jordan Marsh department store company and The Boston Globe.         She was a major contributor to dance programs at the Kennedy Center, to the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She contributed to a number of charitable causes through the Hopeful Fund, which she founded to support programs and services for the homeless in Washington.         Born in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., Mrs. Kidder was raised in New York City and Paris. In 1938, she married Randolph Appleton Kidder, a member of the Foreign Service.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Kidder is survived by her son, Michael R. Kidder of New Hampshire, and five grandchildren.       
         Joanne Toor Cummings, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died yesterday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, according to the family.         Mrs. Cummings and her husband, Nathan Cummings, the founder of the Consolidated Foods Corporation, who died in 1985, were longtime collectors. The Cummingses gave more than 600 pieces of pre-Columbian works to a gallery bearing his name at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Their apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue was filled with an array of sculpture by Giacometti and Manzu and paintings by Matisse, Gauguin and Degas.         They also made substantial contributions to the Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York Hospital, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and other hospitals.         Mrs. Cummings was born in Chicago, the daughter of Harriet Toor and Harold Toor, former chairman of the United States Shoe Corporation.         She graduated in 1953 from Connecticut College, to which she and her husband donated the Joanne and Nathan Cummings Art Center and endowed a scholarship for needy students. She served as a trustee of the college from 1981 to 1991.         She also received a master's degree from Columbia University's School of International Relations. She was a member of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy for 19 years, and its senior vice president since 1991.         Mrs. Cummings was involved in a wide variety of philanthropies. She was a life governing member of the Chicago Art Institute and a patron of the American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, New York City Opera, Metropolitan Opera and Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She is survived by a sister, Suzanne Toor Karpas of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and Manhattan.       
         Charlotte Appleton Kidder Ramsay, a philanthropist and wildlife conservationist, died on Saturday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 53.         Her death, which her husband, William Ramsay, said was caused by an aneurysm, occurred two days before that of her mother, Dorothy Robinson Kidder, who died of cancer at age 78.         Mrs. Ramsay was a member of the advisory council of the African Wildlife Foundation and founder and chairwoman of the Jordan Conservation and Research Center, an organization dedicated to training African wildlife researchers.         Born in Australia, where her father, Randolph A. Kidder, was on assignment in the Foreign Service, Mrs. Ramsay was the great-great-granddaughter of Eben D. Jordan, founder of the Jordan Marsh department stores and The Boston Globe.         Her first marriage, to E. Joseph Luskey, ended in divorce in 1983.         She is survived by her second husband, Mr. Ramsay, a scientist and writer whom she married in 1988; a daughter, Ann Luskey Weir, and a son, Randolph Kidder Luskey, both of Washington; her father and a brother, Michael Randolph Kidder of Spofford, N.H.       
         Ina Bradley, a lifelong supporter of theater arts in Connecticut, died on Sunday at Norwalk Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Westport, Conn.         Mrs. Bradley, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., served on the board of directors of the Westport Country Playhouse and fought to save the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn.         Mrs. Bradley was also active in radio and television as a weekly panelist on "What in the World," a quiz show, for WTIC-TV in Hartford and as a writer and producer of her own television interview show for WICC-TV in Bridgeport.         She sat on the board of Connecticut Public Television and was the chairman of the program advisory board of WTIC. For the last four decades, she wrote a column, "Fancy Free," for The Fairfield Citizen-News, a weekly newspaper.         Her husband, J. Kenneth Bradley, the Republican state chairman for Connecticut for many years, died in 1969. She is survived by two daughters, Deborah Bradley Donnelly of Roxbury, Conn., and Bonnie Bradley Anderson of Westport; a son, James Peters Bradley of Fairfield, and six grandchildren.       
         Diana Chin Hsu, a veteran Chinese journalist, novelist and poet whose writings on love, suffering and tragedy are read throughout Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, died on Wednesday in Queens. She was 77.         The cause of death was stomach cancer, according to her son, Hugh H. Mo, a lawyer in New York.         As a reporter for Chinese newspapers during World War II, Ms. Hsu covered the Chinese resistance against the Japanese and her articles were widely read in the Far East. But Ms. Hsu gained wider popularity after she escaped Communist China with the three youngest of munists executed her husband, Mo Tze Shin, the director of Chiang Kai-shek's secret police force, the Shanghai Bureau of Criminal Investigation.         Her book "Mao Zedong Killed My Husband" was a best-seller in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.         In 1954, at the invitation of Chiang Ching-kuo, a son of Chiang Kai-shek who later became President of Taiwan, Ms. Hsu visited Taiwan and joined the Government newspaper, China Daily News, where she covered international politics. In 1960, Ms. Hsu became a special foreign correspondent for the paper in New York.         Ms. Hsu traveled through Asia and Europe, eventually settling in New York, and was eventually reunited with her eight children.         She went on to write seven novels, all with anti-Communist themes. Attempts by the Chinese Government to undermine her only enhanced her popularity.         In 1985, the Chinese community in New York was in an uproar when Ms. Hsu and her son, Mr. Mo, who was serving as a Deputy Police Commissioner in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, accepted an invitation from the Chinese Government and visited the mainland. Today, some pro-Taiwan Chinese have not forgiven them.         "Maybe the old generation can't sit down and break bread," Mr. Mo said after his trip to China in 1985. "But the ideological split doesn't involve me."         Ms. Hsu is survived by four daughters, LiYa Mo, Li Qun Mo and Li Guo Mo, all of New York City, and Li Min Mo of Cambridge, Mass., and two other sons, Lin H. Mo and Chi Mo of New York, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Dickson, an American-born musical comedy performer who captivated British audiences in the 1920's and 30's and became a member of the country's theatrical and social elite, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 102.         Until her friend Michael Thornton, the British biographer, tracked down her birth certificate, it had been assumed that Miss Dickson was born on July 20, 1900, the date given in a standard reference work.         But that would have made her a mere 14 in 1914, when as a Chicago debutante she scandalized North Shore society by dropping out of Madame Young's finishing school to form a dance team with Carl Hyson, a wealthy young man who later became her husband.         Before the season was over the pair claimed a long-distance tango record by dancing the equivalent of 22,000 miles at clubs in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York.         A 1900 birth date would also have meant that Miss Dickson was only 16 on Feb. 20, 1917, when she opened as a featured dancer in "Oh Boy!," a Jerome Kern hit that ran for 463 performances at the Princess Theater in New York.         Although she became a Ziegfeld girl and appeared in other Broadway shows, including Kern's "Rock-a-Bye Baby" in 1918, it was not until she got to England in 1921 as the lead in the London company of "Sally" that she became a star. Playing the part made famous by Marilyn Miller in New York a year earlier, Miss Dickson introduced the Kern standard "Look for the Silver Lining" to British audiences, and was a darling of the West End from then on.         She and the show were so successful that Kern and P. G. Wodehouse wrote another one especially for her. "The Cabaret Girl" ran for 361 performances at the Wintergarden Theater there.         It was during the "Cabaret Girl" run that Miss Dickson made one of her most important British conquests, a lasting friendship with Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who was so enchanted with Miss Dickson that she took her fiance to a performance. The fiance, then the Duke of York, eventually became King George VI. The former Lady Elizabeth is the Queen Mother of Britain.         At a birthday lunch Miss Dickson gave at her home in 1980, the Queen Mother demonstrated her own musical-comedy talents by singing a "Cabaret Girl" tune, "Dancing Time." She sent roses for Miss Dickson's 100th-birthday celebration two years ago.         Miss Dickson appeared in many other London productions, including a 1925 revival of "Peter Pan." She also became friends with Noel Coward and other theater luminaries. When she filed for divorce from Mr. Hyson in 1935, it was reported that Miss Dickson was expected to marry a British peer. In fact she never remarried.         Although her career had faded considerably by the 1940's, Miss Dickson re-emerged as a founder of the London Stage Door Canteen, which entertained thousands of Allied troops during World War II.         Her last theater roles were in "Red Letter Day" and "As Long as They Are Happy," in 1953, and she made her last stage appearance in 1980 during a 75th-anniversary celebration of "Peter Pan."         A dedicated Christian Scientist who made daily walks from her Eaton Square apartment to a reading room until she was well into her 90's, Miss Dickson remained a familiar and sprightly figure in London.         In addition to Miss Quayle, she is survived by her daughter, Lady Quayle, the widow of the actor Anthony Quayle; two other grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 29, 1995, Friday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about Dorothy Dickson, a former musical comedy star, referred incompletely to one survivor. She is the actress Jenny Quayle, a granddaughter.       
         Annie Kriegel, a French ex-Communist who was a historian and analyst of Communism, died on Aug. 26 in a Paris hospital. She was 68 and lived in Paris.         She had cancer, said the French newspaper Le Figaro, which reported her death on Aug. 28.         Professor Kriegel had retired from academic work after teaching at the University of Paris-Nanterre from 1969 into the 1990's.         As a teen-ager, she was active in the Resistance against the Nazi occupation of her country. She became prominent in the postwar French Communist Party but resigned in 1957.         Her 1972 book, "The French Communists," was hailed in The New York Times Book review by an American historian of France, Robert O. Paxton of Columbia University, as "the most probing single work on the French Communist Party, and perhaps on any Western Communist party." She wrote more than a dozen books, beginning in 1964.         A British historian of France, Douglas Johnson, wrote in The Independent on Friday that Professor Kriegel was respected as an individual force among French intellectuals.         Professor Johnson -- whose French-born wife, Madeleine, roomed with Professor Kriegel in the 1940's -- said the explanation for her "remarkable career is to be found in her wartime experience" and gave this account:         "Coming from a Jewish-Alsatian family and having passed idyllic school days in the Marais district of Paris, she encountered the anti-Semitic legislation of the occupation and then the infamous roundup of Jews on 16 July 1942.         "As the men were forcibly separated from the women and children, she heard screams which she said contained all the pain that life and death provide. She sat on a bench and wept. 'It was on that bench that I left my childhood,' she afterwards said."         Then she escaped Paris and joined a Communist Resistance group. After the war she studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Sevres, held posts in teaching and related fields and wrote for Le Figaro.         Annie Becker Kriegel was born in Paris. Her marriage to Guy Besse ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband of 40 years, Dr. Arthur Kriegel; and four children, Maurice, Danielle, Irene and Emmanuel.       
         Mary Alice Barney Kean, who was long prominent in the historical preservation field, died on Monday at her 223-year-old home, Liberty Hall in Union, N.J. She was 93.         At her death, Mrs. Kean (pronounced cane) was president of the Elizabethtown Historical Foundation in New Jersey. She became the first female trustee of the New-York Historical Society and remained a trustee from 1967 to 1984. Liberty Hall was built for her ancestor William Livingston, New Jersey's first Governor after the American Revolution.         From 1956 through 1960, she was the president general -- the ranking officer -- of the Colonial Dames of America, a Manhattan-based society whose members trace their ancestry to Colonial times. The Colonial Dames own the site on East 61st Street that includes what is now the Abigail Adams Smith Museum, which once stood on an estate owned by President John Adams's daughter Abigail and her husband.         In addition, Mrs. Kean was a governor of the New Jersey Historical Society, which gave her an award for her historic-preservation work. She was active in preservation projects as far afield as Virginia.         Over the years, she was also president of the New York Chapter of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, a directress general of the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames and a trustee of St. Bernard's School in Manhattan and of Cooper Union.         Mr. Kean died in 1949, at 60. He was president of the National State Bank, the Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Company and the Elizabethtown Water Company, all in Elizabeth, N.J. Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, is his nephew.         Mrs. Kean is survived by a daughter, Mary Alice Raynolds of Lander, Wyo.; two sons, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Stewart, of Union, N.J., 9 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Gladys M. Dorman, a lawyer who served 20 years on the New York City Board of Higher Education, died on Thursday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 84.         As a girl growing up in Flatbush, Miss Dorman, who continued to use her maiden name throughout her professional career, became well acquainted with the law.         Her father, Benjamin Dorman, a leading figure in the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, worked his way up through the court system to become chief clerk of the Surrogate's Court in Brooklyn, where Miss Dorman practiced as an estate planner and wills litigator for more than 30 years. She was a partner of Raphael & Dorman with her husband, Benjamin R. Raphael, a Brooklyn Law School classmate whom she married in 1939. He died in 1992.         For all the family precedent, Miss Dorman, who received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1931, intended an academic career. But after she obtained a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1933, she switched to the law when a post she had been promised as an instructor at Brooklyn College evaporated in Depression economics.         She obtained her degree in 1936, and four years later was one of the first seven women elected to the Brooklyn Bar Association. In 1966, she became the first woman to serve as a trustee.         Miss Dorman's service on the Board of Higher Education, the governing body of the city colleges, began with an interim appointment by Mayor William O'Dwyer in 1949.         Miss Dorman was a member of the board's executive committee and chairwoman of the board's Brooklyn College administrative committee.         She is survived by two sons, both lawyers, Stephen M. Raphael of Brooklyn and Allan H. Raphael of Oak Park, Ill.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Mary M. Kaufman, a retired lawyer whose practice included cases involving Communism and Nazism, as well as defending the poor, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt division of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 82 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaufman retired about 1980, after having worked in Manhattan for almost all her career. Some of her other cases involved antiwar activities. She practiced mainly without partners.         In 1951, she was in a Federal courtroom as a defense lawyer when Dashiell Hammett, the writer, and W. Alphaeus Hunton, secretary of the Council on African Affairs, were convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison.         She asked Judge Sylvester Ryan to release Mr. Hunton in her custody or set bail, but he refused.         Judge Ryan had found Mr. Hammett and Mr. Hunton guilty for refusing to name contributors to the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which the Attorney General had designated as a Communist subversive front. Mrs. Kaufman's clients included the bail fund as well as Mr. Hunton.         In the preceding two years, the civil rights group had posted $500,000 or more bail for Communists accused of criminal conspiracy or involved in deportation cases, and it had forfeited more than $100,000 because of bail jumping.         In the 1940's, Mrs. Kaufman worked for the National War Labor and Wage Stabilization Boards, and she was a prosecutor at a war-crimes trial in Nuremberg.         She was born Mary Metlay in Atlanta, but grew up mainly in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, she received her law degree from St. John's University and was admitted to the bar in 1937. She became an original member of the National Lawyers Guild in that year.         Her marriage to Frederick Kaufman ended in divorce. Her second husband, Paul Albert, died last year.         Surviving are a son, Michael, of Beacon Falls, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Janice Albert of Rome and Marilyn Albert of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Mira Barer-Hopkins, a former deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, died on Saturday at a Manhattan apartment she had been subletting while undergoing medical treatment. She was 44 and lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         Dr. Barer-Hopkins, known professionally as Dr. Mira Barer, had pancreatic cancer and was in New York City for treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, The Miami Herald reported yesterday.         At her death, she was the director of the Broward County, Fla., Department of Natural Resource Protection, but she had not worked since January. She took the post in 1991.         Dr. Barer-Hopkins was with the New York Department of Environmental Protection from 1981 to 1991. She began as supervisor of the Office of Environmental Impact, which was responsible for assessing the impact of land-use proposals on wetlands, beach erosion, air, noise and water quality.         She went on to head the department's Hazardous Materials Bureau with the title of assistant commissioner. Later, she was deputy commissioner for environmental management.         She was a native New Yorker, born in Brooklyn, and received a Ph.D. in marine biology from City University.         She is survived by her husband, James M. Hopkins; her mother, Helen Barer of Cranbury, N.J., and her brother, Sol, of Westfield, N.J.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Judy Dearing, a costume designer for scores of musicals, dances and plays, as well as a dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at New York Hospital.         She was 55 and lived in Manhattan. Her family said the cause of death was acute pneumonia.         Ms. Dearing began her career dancing with Miriam Makeba and acting with the Negro Ensemble Company. But she devoted much of the last 20 years to designing costumes for a wide range of theater arts. In 1985 she won an Obie for her World War II uniforms for Charles Fuller's drama "A Soldier's Play."         As a dancer, Ms. Dearing made her own costumes, a skill she said she had learned as a child. In 1976, she was hired by Oz Scott, the director of Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"; she was given $100 to create costumes for the show's seven performers.         Her penny-pinching solution was to buy a long bolt of inexpensive crepe-back satin from which she made seven dresses dyed seven different colors.         She went on to design costumes for "Checkmates," "The Legacy of Williams and Walker," two shows now on Broadway, "Swinging on a Star" and "Having Our Say," and a production of "Porgy and Bess" that is now on tour.         She also designed costumes for "Shimada," "Once on This Island" (for which she received a Tony nomination), "The Poison Tree," "What the Wine Sellers Buy," "Death and the King's Horsemen," "The Mighty Gents," and "Lamppost Reunion."         Her Off Broadway credits include "Moms," "Ma Rose," "Trick" and "Split Second."         For the New York Shakespeare Festival, her credits included "The Forbidden City," "Jonah," "The Dance" and "The Railroad."'         Her costumes for the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater included "Nubian Lady," "Inside" and "I See the Moon."         Woven through her highly colorful and original designs was a folkloric look. She used printed kente cloth, Dutch cotton prints, raw silk and chiffon with metallics. "A costume has to be natural," she said in an interview in 1990silk and chiffon with metallics. "A costume has to be natural," she said in an interview in 1990. "Everything has to be set up to look natural."         Ms. Dearing grew up in Manhattan and graduated from City College, where she majored in mathematics and science. She began her career in the theater as a dancer. She married John Parks, another dancer, and collaborated with him on a number of concerts. She also performed with the Sun Ock Lee Dance Company.         Ms. Dearing was also a professor of design at Howard University.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Aissatou Parks of Manhattan; her mother, Elizabeth Dearing of Tuskegee, Ala.; her father, Charles, of Manhattan; two sisters, Carole, of Tuskegee, and Bianca, of Manhattan; and two brothers, Charles, of Tuskegee, and Andre, of Manhattan.       
         Before she made her Metropolitan Opera debut last Saturday in the title role  of Bizet's "Carmen," Denyce Graves kept telling herself that the Met was simply  another opera house. After all, she had already sung the role at the Vienna State Opera, at the Bastille Opera in Paris and at Covent Garden, 21 productions in the last two years alone.         "I tried to think of this as just another engagement," she said recently, "but nobody would let me do that."         She was referring not only to managers and the news media, but also to her family, friends and former teachers from the tough southwest Washington neighborhood where she grew up, a gritty area near a sewage treatment center and an automobile impoundment lot. More than 50 of her relatives and former neighbors traveled to New York by chartered bus for her Met debut; some 50 more  came by train and car.         For years, most people at home saw Ms. Graves as "some sort of space alien,"  she said, what with her exotic notions of becoming an opera singer. But "a Met debut was something they understood," she said, and the tumultuous standing ovation she got on Saturday night "really clinched it for them." She sings the role again this afternoon and on Wednesday and next Saturday.         Ms. Graves knows that her personal story is the kind of inspirational saga Americans love: a television crew from "60 Minutes" covered her Met debut. "This was not just a move for myself, but for my people, my family," the 30-year-old mezzo-soprano said. "I realize now that what I say affects my family, so I've become more protective of their feelings, my mother's in particular. It's not just my story; it's hers."         Ms. Graves was the second of three children. Her father, an alcoholic, abusive man, left the family when her mother was pregnant with their third child. The children did not see him for again for 18 years, when he turned up, unannounced, at the high school graduation of Ms. Graves's younger sister. By then he had become a minister. They have not heard from him since.         Left alone with three children to raise, Ms. Graves's mother found work as a  clerk-typist at the University of the District of Columbia. (Today, Mrs. Dorothy Graves Kenner, her name from a second marriage, is registrar.) She was out of the house before the children were up, and gone most of the day. "When she got home, we had to have dinner ready," Ms. Graves said. "We did the cooking, dishwashing and cleaning in rotating one-week shifts."         Yet her mother provided a rich, if regimented, family life. Participation in  their fundamentalist Baptist church was mandatory. Ms. Graves sang in the choir  and helped out at Sunday school. At home, her mother dedicated each night of the week to some educational project: one night the children would present oral book reports or speak on assigned topics (like birds, flowers or geography). Thursday was music night, when the family performed gospel as an impromptu vocal group at churches and meeting halls. Popular music of any kind was banned in the house, though Ms. Graves listened to some illicit Michael Jackson on the radio when she was alone. "My mother worked so hard," Ms. Graves said. "She didn't want her babies to be lost to the streets, like so many."         At school, Ms. Graves's singing was encouraged by a strong-willed music teacher, Judith Grove. "I adored her," Ms. Graves said. "I thought she hung the  moon." Ms. Grove directed her to the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, a public high school in Washington. She was accepted immediately. There, she received private voice lessons and attended her first opera: a dress rehearsal for Beethoven's "Fidelio," on a school expedition to the Kennedy Center.         After high school, Ms. Graves made great progress under Helen Hodam, a renowned voice teacher, first at Oberlin Conservatory, and then at the New England Conservatory. In Boston, she took side jobs to support herself: cleaning dormitories, working as an all-night hotel desk clerk. When she decided to enter the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions, she had all the makings of a finalist: a lustrous mezzo-soprano voice and a striking stage presence. But her  performance was charged with a special determination. "I had to win," she said.  "I was four months behind in my rent. I couldn't pay for the rented dress I was wearing." Ms. Graves won.         The pressure took its toll. After the competition, her voice failed her. The  problem later turned out to be a treatable thyroid condition. But her performance at the finals in New York City was "a disaster," Ms. Graves said. Demoralized, she quit singing and took a secretarial job.         Yet the word of her promise had spread. The Houston Grand Opera called to invite her to participate in its program for young artists. She declined. When they called twice more, her friends prevailed on her to accept. ("It was a sign, like something meant to be," she said.)         Since then, her success has come steadily. One of her big supporters is Placido Domingo, who sang Don Jose to her Carmen at Covent Garden. They first met in Houston when Ms. Graves sang Emilia in a production of Verdi's "Otello."  "What impressed me immediately about her, aside from her obvious vocal and physical beauty, was an aura of the dramatic about her," Mr. Domingo said recently.         "As Carmen," he continued, "she is so good that the world might want her exclusively for this role. That would be a shame, because she has very much to offer in other parts." In his capacity as future artistic director of the Washington Opera, Mr. Domingo has invited her to sing two other leading roles, which have not yet been announced.         In developing her approach to this signature role, Ms. Graves avoided listening to recordings of celebrated Carmens from the past. Moreover, she counts herself lucky to have done her first Carmen in a modern-dress production  at the Minnesota Opera.         "I didn't want to do a traditional Carmen," she said. "Carmen is an unapologetic modern woman, a woman of the 90's. She speaks constantly about her  freedom, but she is no whore. Her spirit is free. She is attracted to Don Jose precisely because he isn't interested. When she realizes she truly loves him, she becomes afraid and treats him badly. Love means losing your freedom. I think she is essentially a very sad person."         Vocally, she finds the role gratifying, but frustrating. Unlike the other characters, Carmen has no defining "stand-and-deliver aria," as Ms. Graves put it, which makes portraying her true character a challenge. "Carmen sings songs,  but these are set pieces involving other people," she said. Carmen's most famous song, the "Habanera," is a "dramatic miscalculation," according to Ms. Graves, wrongly inserted by Bizet into the score after the premiere at the insistence of the first Carmen, Celestine Galli-Marie. "It's an awkward introduction to Carmen," Ms. Graves said. "In the original version, she enters, sings her few insinuating lines, then leaves, like a black cat crossing the stage. That's much more in character."         Her recent performances include Adalgisa in "Norma" at Zurich, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" at La Scala, and Dalila in a concert performance of "Samson et Dalila" with the Chicago Symphony under James Levine. She is looking  forward to performing Marguerite in Berlioz's "Damnation of Faust" in Houston and Bonn ("I adore that music"), and hopes someday to sing Blanche in one of her favorites, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites."         The sudden attention has left Ms. Graves excited but unaffected. Greeting a visitor in her hotel suite, she curled up on the couch in an oversize sweatshirt and casually stirred gobs of honey into her tea with a dinner knife when no teaspoon was handy. As she relaxed next to her husband, David Perry, an importer of fine classical guitars, she seemed content with the way her life has turned out.         "Perhaps this should be the last interview about the past," Mr. Perry suggested. "From now on, the future will be the story." Ms. Graves nodded quietly.       
         Genora Johnson Dollinger, who rallied support for the hard-fought strike that gave the United Auto Workers union its foothold at the General Motors Company in 1937, died on Wednesday at Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 and had lived in Los Angeles since 1966.         Mrs. Dollinger was 23 when she organized the Women's Auxiliary of the U.A.W. and the Women's Emergency Brigade to feed and shield 2,000 strikers occupying a crucial Fisher Body Division plant in Flint, Mich. The strike began on Christmas Eve 1936 and ended 44 days later with the company's recognition of the union as bargaining agent for its work force.         The strike crippled General Motors, and its settlement proved a stellar event for the whole labor movement because it gave new stature to unions representing industrial workers.         Mrs. Dollinger's first husband, Kermit Johnson, was the only member of a citywide strike committee actually employed at the Fisher plant chosen for the strike. When spirits flagged during the long confrontation, her resolve stiffened the will of the "sitdowners."         Her women's auxiliaries went house-to-house to calm worried mothers and wives and gain their support. They also collected cash and food for their soup kitchens. And she had her women's brigade, wielding clubs, marching up and down the iron main gate and barricade to put their bodies between Pinkerton agents and their men inside.         In an interview with Studs Terkel for his most recent book, "Coming of Age" (New Press, 1995), she recalled how she and four of her unarmed lieutenants once stalled the police.         "Beating an unarmed woman was a different story in those days," she said. "We looked up and here came the emergency brigade, the Red Berets. We called ourselves that because of our red berets, red arm bands with white letters: EB. They were carrying the American flag and singing 'Solidarity Forever' and 'Hold the Fort'."         She said she was blacklisted in Flint and moved to Detroit and a job at the Briggs Manufacturing Company, a Chrysler supplier. She became a leader in a militant unit of the U.A.W. and was dismissed and rehired after thousands of Briggs workers went on strike for her.         Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., she grew up in Flint and, by age 18, was a charter member of the Flint Socialist Party. The party later turned into a catalyst for the strikes, which were widely denounced as Communist inspired.         Mrs. Dollinger continued as a union organizer. She fell victim to a lead-pipe attack in a wave of anti-union violence that included the shootings of Walter and Victor Reuther, both veterans of the 1937 strike at G.M.         She was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Michigan Women's Historical Center in Lansing last year.         Besides her husband of 51 years, Sol Dollinger, Mrs. Dollinger is survived by their son, Ronald, also of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren. Her first marriage ended in divorce.       
         Helen Vlachos, a publisher who closed her newspapers and fled Greece rather than submit to censorship under the military junta that ruled from 1967 to 1974, died on Saturday, Reuters reported yesterday from Athens, quoting officials at the press ministry. She was 85.         Ms. Vlachos was a legend in Greek journalism whose popularity rose in the late 1940's when she began writing a column in her father's respected daily paper, Kathimerini, in which she regularly criticized the Government.         In 1951, she took over Kathimerini and Messimvrini, another daily newspaper, as well as the weekly picture magazine Eikones, but closed them all in 1967 when a group of army colonels seized power, instituted censorship and mandated Government-friendly daily reports.         Because she was a cheerfully outspoken member of the right, anti-Communist rebels counted on her to back their coup and were shocked when she closed the high-circulation dailies.         They were even more disturbed when she openly mocked them in the Italian press, calling them "a circus," and commenting, "They can't tell me how to run newspapers anymore than I can tell them how to run their tanks."         Such wisecracks resulted in charges of "insulting authorities," and she was placed under house arrest in 1967. Although she faced several years in jail had she been brought to trial, she often made light of the situation in the press, and once said that were she ever imprisoned, she hoped it would be noted that her favorite dish was meatballs.         The same year, she made a daring escape from Athens to London that involved dying her hair black to match a fake passport and hiding out in a cramped bordello while her husband, Costas Loundras, tapped around their Athens flat in her high-heeled shoes to trick the guards into believing that she was still under their arrest.         From London she continued to aggressively pressure the government to lift restrictive policies against the press.         She returned home shortly after the junta fell in 1974, reopened her newspapers and was elected to Parliament as a member of the conservative New Democracy party. She published Kathimerini until 1987, when she sold her media holdings.         Ms. Vlachos was born in Athens on Dec. 18, 1911, and was sent abroad to be educated. When she returned to Greece, she went to work for her father as a bookkeeper, and became a reporter in 1935. During her career, she covered everything from Greek earthquakes to the Far East to Mussolini in Libya.         Her father, George, had already set a precedent for political opposition through the press -- he was jailed by a series of Greek Governments for his discourse, and refused to cooperate with Nazis when they took over one of his papers in 1941.         Ms. Vlachos chronicled her career and the adventure of her escape in her book "The House Arrest" (Gambit, 1970). In it she wrote: "The most thrilling aspect of this decision was that it was taken by the most conservative of men, by Costa, who with undue haste had drifted into middle age, silently condemning any kind of youthful flutter, choosing severe clothes, discouraging any tendency toward eccentricity, avoiding noisy parties, disliking on me anything conspicuous, insisting on my keeping my hair white."         Information about survivors was not available.       
         Clelia Benjamin Delafield, a philanthropist and founding president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, died on Tuesday in Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. A former resident of New York City and Sarasota, Fla., she was 92 and had lived in Baltimore in recent years.         Mrs. Delafield became a member of the center's board in 1946 and remained a member of the Board of Overseers Emeriti at her death. Her family also donated its wooded estate in Riverdale, the Bronx, to Columbia University.         Mrs. Delafield is survived by two daughters, Clelia D. Carey and Cynthia Delafield, both of Baltimore; a son, Walter B., of New York City; two sisters, Mary B. Henderson of Hunter, N.Y., and Yolanda Jaeckel of Sarasota, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband of 49 years, Edward C. Delafield, a banker, died in 1976.       
         Ruth Smallberg, a retired administrator of the Hunter College Library, died on Tuesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Smallberg was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Hunter College, she worked there for nearly 30 years until she retired from her senior library post three years ago. She was also vice president of the Scholarship and Welfare Fund of the Alumni Association of Hunter College and a founding member of the Friends of the Hunter College Library.         She is survived by her husband, Seymour; two sons, Ralph, of Manhattan, and Victor, of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Lois Schmittlinger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, the black honors graduate who needed a backhanded assist from the Supreme Court in 1948 to win admission to the University of Oklahoma law school, died on Wednesday at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 71  and had served for three years on the university's board of regents, the very body that had denied her admission on the basis of her race.         The cause of death was cancer, her daughter, Charlene Factory, said.         By the time Mrs. Fisher applied to the University of Oklahoma law school on  Jan. 14, 1946, the Supreme Court had long held that under the separate-but-equal doctrine, states that sponsored law schools for white students were required to  supply similar training for qualified black students.         Since Oklahoma had no law school for black students, it seemed obvious that the white law school would be required to admit the eminently qualified Mrs. Fisher. An honors graduate of Langston, a state-run black college, she had been  recruited by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to test the state's harsh segregation laws, which, among other things, imposed a fine on any teacher who taught a mixed-race class.         But Oklahoma argued that the state planned to open a black law school someday and kept Mrs. Fisher at bay for more than two years, until January 1948, when the Supreme Court rejected the state's arguments and ordered it to provide her with a legal education.         The court did not specifically order her admission to the university law school, and when Oklahoma tried to satisfy the court by instantly creating a black law school exclusively for Mrs. Fisher, the court turned down her follow-up appeal in February 1948. The court said her original petition had not  addressed the issue of whether the creation of a separate law school for black students would fulfill the state's obligations under the 14th Amendment.         Mrs. Fisher may not have won her immediate point before the Supreme Court, but the arguments raised by her lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, who had denounced the state action as a sham, had a powerful impact on the court as it picked its way  toward the landmark 1954 decision overturning the separate-but-equal doctrine.         And Mrs. Fisher's campaign, which had won wide backing from the state's college teachers and students, had changed the political climate in Oklahoma. With dozens of other black college graduates pressing for admission to Oklahoma  graduate schools, the state swiftly backed down.         Mrs. Fisher was admitted to the law school in June 1949, but under such harsh conditions that any of her fellow students who had not already rallied to her cause were soon won over. She was forced to sit in a raised chair apart from the other students, behind a sign reading "Colored." And she had to use a side door  to the cafeteria and sit at a table separated by a chain from the rest of the room; a uniformed guard was posted to prevent interracial mingling.         But when the guard was not there, Mrs. Fisher later recalled, white students  would climb under the chain to encourage her. "They said, 'Come on, Ada, we've been waiting for you.' "         After Mrs. Fisher graduated in 1951, she worked for a while as a lawyer. She  returned to the university to earn a master's degree in history in 1968, and she joined the faculty at Langston University.         When she was appointed to the seven-member board of regents in April 1992, Mrs. Fisher said she had come full circle.         Mrs. Fisher's survivors all live in Oklahoma City; her husband, Warren, died  several years ago. In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, Bruce; a sister, Helen Huggins; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Gorman Cahill, who became the first Miss America in 1921 and spent the better part of the next seven decades trying to live down the bathing beauty image, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Bowie, Md. She was 90 and had lived her entire life in Washington.         Unlike latter-day Miss Americas, who can assert that it was really their talent or their poise that made the difference, Mrs. Cahill could make no such claim.         In September 1921, when she beat out seven other contestants, including a New York showgirl, the pageant was an unabashed beauty contest. Lest there be any misunderstanding, the organizers billed it both as the Inter-City Beauty Contest and the Atlantic City Bathing Beauty Contest and conducted it on the beach.         To be sure, the swimsuits of the era were demure by modern standards, none more so than Mrs. Cahill's. While some of her rivals violated a local modesty ordinance by appearing barelegged on the beach, she wore dark, knee-high stockings and a chiffon bathing costume with a tiered skirt that came almost to her knees.         A petite, blue-eyed beauty whose long blond ringlets made her a Mary Pickford look-alike, Mrs. Cahill was not only the first Miss America, but also set two pageant records that still stand.         At 5 feet 1 inch and 108 pounds, she remains the smallest Miss America, and with a 30-25-32 figure that was close to the flapper era ideal, the slimmest.         But Mrs. Cahill had a certain advantage. When she won in 1921, she was only 16 years old, and by some accounts, only 15.         When she defended her title in 1922, a year older and more mature, she lost to Miss Ohio, Mary Campbell, who beat her again the next year to become the only two-time winner.         Whatever her age was at the time -- Mrs. Cahill would never discuss the matter -- when reporters from The Washington Herald came to her Georgetown home in the summer of 1921 to notify Margee Gorman that on the basis of a photograph submitted by her parents she had been selected to represent the newspaper in the Atlantic City contest, they found her in a nearby park shooting marbles in the dirt.         (Mrs. Cahill later took great pains to correct what she saw as the implications of the activity. "I was not a tomboy," she said. "I loved all the boys.")         In later years, as the contest grew into a major annual event, Mrs. Cahill, who in 1925 married Vincent Cahill, a real estate broker, sought to distance herself from her role in the pageant, especially the beauty queen label. "My husband hated it," she said. "I did, too."         Even so, three years after her husband's death, she was persuaded to attend the 1960 contest, but she later called the organizers cheap for not reimbursing her for $1,500 in expenses.         She is survived by a brother, William L. Gorman of Fort Myers, Fla.       
         Nancy Graves, an erudite Post-Minimalist artist who combined abstraction with an exacting naturalism, died on Saturday at New N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Avery L. Smith.         A prolific artist who worked in painting, sculpture, printmaking and film, Ms. Graves first made her presence felt on the New York art scene in the late 1960's and 70's, with life-size sculptures of camels that seemed as accurate as a natural history display (down to the real skin). Closer examination, however, revealed myriad distortions of both form and surface, as well as deliberate signs of handwork, so that the ultimate effect was strangely abstract.         Although idiosyncratic, the camels were representative of a widespread effort among younger artists to take Minimalism's emphasis on given facts and forms, as well as new materials, into unexpected areas. Like-minded artists included Eva Hesse, Chuck Close, Bruce Nauman and Richard Serra, to whom Ms. Graves was married from 1965 to 1970.         Nancy Stevenson Graves was born in Pittsfield, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1940, and throughout her life she retained the reserve and dry humor of a quintessential New Englander. Her dual interest in art and science was encouraged by frequent visits to the Berkshire Museum, where her father worked and which had collections devoted to both art and natural history.         After graduating from Vassar College as an English major in 1961, she attended Yale, where she earned bachelor's and master's of fine arts degrees from the School of Art and Architecture in 1964. Grants enabled her to spend the next two years studying in Europe, first in Paris and then in Florence, where the life-size wax studies of an 18th-century anatomist named Susini inspired her to work from natural forms.         She settled on the camel as the first of these forms, and with typical thoroughness spent three months learning carpentry to be able to devise an armature. Working in Fiberglas, latex, marble dust and other unorthodox materials, Ms. Graves moved on to camel skeletons and bones, which she dispersed about the floor or hung from ceilings, and based other works on a variety of archeological and paleontological subjects, including fossils, totems and mummies.         In the early 1970's, she traveled to Morocco, making several films whose repeated sequences of camel herds emphasized the mesmerizing rhythms of their movements.         In 1972 Ms. Graves forsook sculpture for painting, making beautifully colored, ostensibly abstract works that were often based on a wide range of maps and charts, including those of the ocean floor and the surfaces of Mars and the moon. When she returned to sculpture in the late 1970's, she learned the lost-wax process so she could work in bronze, experimenting with unusual patinas that translated her natural forms into a palette of highly artificial hot pinks, blues and yellows.         She gradually expanded her vocabulary to include not only plants, flowers, fish and occasional pieces of the human skeleton but also man-made objects like fans, colanders and tools. These disparate parts were assembled into gracefully balanced sculptures whose elegant linearity recalled the "drawing in space" sculptures of David Smith. At the end of her life, Ms. Graves was incorporating handblown glass into her sculptures and experimenting with poly-optics, a glasslike material that can be cast.         Ms. Graves, whose first New York exhibition was at the Graham Gallery in 1968, has been represented by M. Knoedler & Company since 1980. She exhibited extensively in galleries in the United States and Europe and is represented in museums around the world. Her most recent museum retrospective, organized by the Fort Worth Art Museum, traveled to the Brooklyn Museum in 1987. An exhibition of new hand-painted prints closed on Saturday at the Betsy Senior Gallery in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Mary Bates of Pittsfield; a sister, Judith G. Clarke of Worthington, Mass., and two stepsons, Barrett L. and Carter L. Smith.

         Linda Goodman, whose down-to-earth insights into character traits were credited with bringing astrology out of the occult section and onto the best-seller lists with the 1968 publication of "Sun Signs," died on Saturday at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. She was about 70 and lived in Cripple Creek.         The hospital said the cause was complications of diabetes.         It may have been "the dawning of the age of Aquarius," as the 1960's song put it, but until Mrs. Goodman, a one-time newspaper reporter and sometime radio writer who had picked up an interest in astrology from grocery store booklets, sat down at her typewriter, the rays had not caused a blink in the publishing industry.         Within months after an obscure house named Taplinger brought out "Sun Signs," in 1968, it had become the first book on astrology to make The New York Times Best-Seller List.         Since then, her agent, Arthur Klebanoff, said yesterday, "Sun Signs," and two follow-up volumes, "Love Signs," (1978) and "Star Signs," (1988) have sold more than 30 million copies in 15 languages and continue to sell some 200,000 copies a year.         The $2.3 million paid for the paperback rights to "Love Signs" set an industry record.         What set Mrs. Goodman's books apart was a combination of her sharp insights and her elegant, accessible style.         Writing in the first person and drawing on the lives of celebrities, historical figures and personal friends to illustrate her points, Mrs. Goodman sometimes seemed more psychologist than astrologer.         Whether your sweetheart's streak of, say, stubbornness, came from the stars or childhood experiences, Mrs. Goodman was a master in elaborating how it would play out against your own tendencies as a dreamer.         Mrs. Goodman, whose original name was Mary Alice Kemery, was born in Morgantown, W. Va., on a date she gave as April 19 in a year she would never disclose.         "I once asked my grandfather, and he wouldn't tell me either," her son Michael Goodman said yesterday. During an interview a few years ago, Mrs. Goodman was more forthcoming, putting her age "between 435 and 450."         The date made her a triple Aries, and Mrs. Goodman, a five-foot-or-so dynamo fit the astrological profile to a T. "She was pushy," her son said.         A writer since childhood, Mrs. Goodman worked as an itinerant newspaper reporter, radio writer and occasional broadcaster. After reading "Letters from Linda" on a radio program, her son said, she adopted the name Linda.         Mrs. Goodman, whose early marriage to William Snyder ended in divorce, began writing "Sun Signs" in New York after an announcing job that had been promised her second husband, Sam Goodman, fell through.         Although her astrology has been called textbook as opposed to mystical, Mrs. Goodman developed a distinct mystic streak. "Star Signs," for example, draws on both numerology and reincarnation.         And when the New York authorities ruled that her 18-year-old daughter, Sarah Snyder, had committed suicide in 1973, Mrs. Goodman, citing her daughter's astrological chart among other evidence, refused to believe that the body identified by her husband was Sarah's.         She later spent so much time trying to find her daughter that she was forever running out of money, at one point living for several months on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral.         In addition to her son Michael, who is a resident of Keaau, Hawaii, she is survived by another son, William Snyder of Colorado Springs; a daughter, Jill Goodman, of Manchester, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Viveca Lindfors, the tall, dark and square-shouldered Swedish actress whose towering presence made her a star in dozens of movies and plays, died yesterday  in Uppsala, Sweden. She was 74.         The cause was complications from rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter, Lena Tabori. The actress, who lived in Manhattan, had returned to her home city  in July to tour in the play "In Search of Strindberg," Ms. Tabori said.         Miss Lindfors, who played a scientist in the 1994 science-fiction film "Stargate," stars in the movie "Last Summer in the Hamptons," which opened last  week at the East Hampton Film Festival and is to open next month in New York City and Los Angeles.         The film is about one of Miss Lindfors' favorite activities: spending time with relatives in the Hamptons when not working on stage or before a camera, Ms. Tabori said.         Ms. Lindfors, whose full name was Elsa Viveca Torstensdotter Lindfors, trained at the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm for three years before starting to make films in 1940. Her father, Torsten, was a publisher of art books; her mother, Karen, a painter.         Miss Lindfors appeared in many plays in Sweden and was considered that country's leading film attraction before leaving in 1946 for the United States,  where her auburn hair and elegant features led more than one observer to proclaim her an actress of Garboesque beauty.         Her American screen debut was two years later in "Night Unto Night," with Ronald Reagan. The director was Don Siegel, who would become her third husband.         Her early starring roles in American movies included parts in "Adventures of  Don Juan" (1948), with Errol Flynn; "No Sad Songs for Me" (1950), with Margaret  Sullavan, and "Four in a Jeep" (1951), with Ralph Meeker, for which she won the  "Best Actress of the Year" International Film Award.         She won a Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for her 1962 performance in "No Exit" and the Special Award at the Venice Film Festival for the 1960 movie "Weddings and Babies."         Her 1955 Broadway debut in the title role of "Anastasia," a drama about a woman claiming to be the missing daughter of Czar Nicholas 2d, won her immediate acclaim from critics and an award from the Drama League.         One critic called her acting in that play "electrifying." In an interview, Miss Lindfors said she had brought her performance to a peak by torturing herself with memories of how she felt upon the death of her brother two years earlier, "so that I could find the feelings of Anastasia."         Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times, "As Anastasia, longing desperately for the consolation of reunion with a blood relative, Miss Lindfors  is all grace, softness and humility."         Miss Lindfors appeared in plays by Shakespeare, Brecht, Tennessee Williams and others. In 1966, she was a founder and artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.         Her television appearances included parts in the series "The Defenders" and "The Nurses." She also had starring roles in televised productions of the Dostoyevesky novel "The Idiot" and the Thornton Wilder story "The Bridge of San  Luis Rey."         Among her other well-known films are "The Spinning Family" and "In Paradise," both made in Sweden before she came to the United States, and the American movies "To the Victor" (1948), "This Side of the Law" and "Dark City" (1950), "The Story of Ruth" (1960), "An Affair of the Skin" (1963), "Coming Apart" (1969), "The Way We Were" (1973), and two 1978 films, "Girlfriends" and "A Wedding."         In 1990, Miss Lindfors was attacked by a man who slashed her face with a razor as she walked in Greenwich Village. Her wounds required 28 stitches.         Miss Lindfors married and divorced four times. Her husbands were Henry Hasso, a Swedish cinematographer; Folke Rogard, a Swedish attorney; Mr. Siegel, the director, and George Tabori, a Hungarian writer, producer and director.         In addition to her daughter, whose father was Folke Rogard, she is survived by two sons, John Tabori of Washington, whose father was Henry Hasso, and Kristoffer Tabori of Los Angeles, whose father was Don Siegel, and four grandchildren.       
         Beverly Gary Kempton, a freelance writer and former journalist, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 65.         Her husband, the columnist Murray Kempton, said the cause was complications after hip surgery.         A native of Douglaston, Queens, Mrs. Kempton worked for the NBC "Today" show before joining The New York Post, writing profiles and covering the Castro revolution in 1959. She later worked for the Peace Corps in Washington.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Christopher, of Manhattan.

         Lillian Fuchs, a renowned violist, composer, teacher and keeper of musical tradition, died yesterday morning at the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         Lillian Fuchs Stein was "one of the best string players in America," Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1962, and she went on to become one of the most respected string teachers in the world. She taught from 1962 to 1991 at the Manhattan School of Music, from 1964 to 1990 at the Aspen Music Festival and School, and from 1971 to 1993 at the Juilliard School, where she was an emeritus member of the faculty until her death.         Ms. Fuchs was born in 1903 in New York. She took up the piano at an early age, and she and her brother Joseph were taught violin by their father.         "I just developed quietly because nobody paid any attention to me even in my family," she told The Strad magazine in 1986. "They were always fussing over Joseph. I didn't mind at all. I was delighted to be left alone."         She studied violin with the noted Franz Kneisel at the New York Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, and graduated with highest honors in 1924.         Ms. Fuchs made her New York debut on the violin in 1926, but soon shifted her concentration to viola. She collaborated often in performance with her brother Joseph and her other brother, Harry, a cellist. She played in a number of chamber groups, notably the Perole String Quartet and the Musicians Guild, and appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Casals Festival Orchestra.         Ms. Fuchs was the first violist to perform and record the six Bach suites written for solo cello. "The measure of an artist is the silence he or she can inspire," Ross Parmenter wrote in The Times in 1948 of her performance of the Sixth Suite. "The silence for her performance was so intense that someone rattling cellophane in the back of the hall was an irritation to almost the whole audience."         Ms. Fuchs was an important teacher of chamber performance as well as of the viola. Her first pupil, she said in the 1986 Strad article, was "this boy from the West Coast": Isaac Stern. She also taught Pinchas Zukerman, and encouraged him to play viola as well as violin.         As a composer, she won several awards during her student years, and later wrote mainly for the viola.         Ms. Fuchs's husband, Ludwig Stein, died in 1992. She is survived by her brother Joseph; her daughters, Barbara Stein Mallow, a cellist, of Leonia, N.J., and Carol Stein Amado, a violinist, of Merion, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Services are to be held on Sunday afternoon at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.         Correction:  October 10, 1995, Tuesday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the violist and teacher Lillian Fuchs misstated the day of her death. She died on Thursday, not Friday.       
         Lillian Nassau, the doyenne of New York antiques dealers and one of the first in America to see a market in Art Nouveau and Art Deco, died early yesterday at her home in New York. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Nassau held forth in a forest of Tiffany lamps in her two shops, first on Third Avenue and 56th Street and, from 1968 until her retirement in 1982, on East 57th Street. For more than 35 years, her galleries were gathering places for collectors and museum curators from around the world.         They came seeking the 20th-century decorative arts she stocked and the expertise she provided, both on the market and on the history of these objects. She was the first to handle the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany, and became his greatest champion in the revival that began in the mid-1950's and continues today. She paid $176 for her first leaded bronze-and-glass lamp by Tiffany in 1956; before her death Tiffany lamps were selling for more than $1 million.         She was also among the first to stock the works of the giants of early 20th-century European design: Rene Lalique's jewelry and glassware, Georg Jensen's silver, Emile Galle's vases and lamps and the furniture of Josef Hoffmann, Louis Majorelle and Carlo Bugatti.         In the 1970's Mrs. Nassau's clients included Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Barbra Streisand, Andy Warhol, Warner Leroy, all the Beatles and members of Led Zeppelin and Blood Sweat and Tears. Edgar J. Kaufmann Jr., the architectural historian, started collecting Tiffany flower-form vases there in the 1950's. And David Geffen bought most of his Tiffany lamps there in the 1970's, selling them in 1984 at Christie's in New York for two to five times what he had paid. Sydney and Frances Lewis of Richmond, who were Mrs. Nassau's customers from the 1960's until she retired, donated most of their Tiffany, Art Nouveau and Art Deco objects to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond..         And after Mrs. Nassau retired, no dealer took her place as the dominant merchant in the field. She remained a recognized authority, often consulted by curators and collectors.         Retirement was difficult for her at first, said her son, Paul, who took over the shop. "She wanted to keep running the business from home," he said. "But she was always available to talk, and until a few years ago, when she became ill, always gave me good advice."         Lillian Brinberg was born in Warsaw. She arrived with her family in New York when she was 2 years old. She attended public schools and went to Columbia University for a few years, hoping to become a newspaper reporter. Instead, she was married in 1920 to Harry Nassau; they were divorced in the late 1930's.         Mrs. Nassau became a dealer in 20th-century decorative arts in 1945, opening the shop on Third Avenue at 56th Street, her first. By then, she had spent a decade in the antiques business, buying and selling gold and jewelry door to door on Long Island, during the Depression. She also worked in a furniture store in Manhattan where she learned about antiques.         She often recalled that as she came into the business, dealers were taking unpopular Tiffany lamps and knocking out the glass flowers and trees, to sell the metal for junk. By the mid-1950's, the revival in Tiffany glass had begun, and Mrs. Nassau was in the vanguard of dealers handling this material.         Among her donations to institutions was a Tiffany mosaic mural that adds a glow to the courtyard of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also gave the Metropolitan her favorite piece of jewelry, a glorious enameled necklace, made about 1900 by Lalique.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband Dr. Leo S. Palitz and a sister, Pauline Sorkin, all of New York; two grandchildren, and five great-grandsons.       
         Eleanor Aller Slatkin, a cellist admired in her own right and as part of a celebrated musical family, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         Ms. Aller was born in 1917 in New York. Her father, Gregory Aller, who was a cellist like his father, had immigrated from Russia. Ms. Aller performed in Carnegie Hall at the age of 12 and studied at the Juilliard School.         She played from 1939 to 1968 in the Warner Brothers studio orchestra. She met her husband, Felix Slatkin, a conductor and violinist and the concertmaster of the 20th Century-Fox studio orchestra, at a young artists' competition in the Hollywood Bowl; Mr. Slatkin won.         Their home, in Los Angeles, was a constant haunt of musicians and film stars ranging from Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky to Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra. And their children went on to musical careers as well: Leonard Slatkin, now in his final season as music director of the St. Louis Symphony and soon to become music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, and Frederick Zlotkin, a cellist in New York.         Together, Felix Slatkin and Ms. Aller anchored the renowned Hollywood String Quartet throughout its existence, from 1947 to 1961. The group was valued as much for its promotion of 20th-century music as for its compelling performances of classic repertory, and its recordings from the early LP era are still regarded highly.         "My first strong musical memory is of the Villa-Lobos Sixth Quartet, which my parents were rehearsing," Leonard Slatkin once said.         Ms. Aller remained active professionally after the death of her husband, in 1963. She was chairwoman of the string department at DePaul University in Chicago from 1968 to 1970.         She is survived by her sons and by two grandsons, Daniel Slatkin of Washington and Felix Zlotkin of New York.       
         Ruth Wilmanns Lidz, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.         A clinical professor since 1965, she had continued to work in the department, pursuing her interest in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia. She also remained an active member of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society and the American Psychoanalytic Society.         She was born in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Karl Wilmanns, a professor and director of Heidelberg University's psychiatry department. She left Germany shortly after the Hitler regime came to power and completed her medical education in Switzerland.         During World War II, she was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University before entering psychoanalytical practice in Baltimore and New Haven. At Yale, she became known for her work with schizophrenic and other seriously disturbed patients and for dealing with the emotional factors in adolescent pregnancies.         Dr. Lidz is survived by her husband of 56 years, Theodore Lidz, a Yale professor emeritus of psychiatry, and three sons, Victor, of Villanova, Pa., Charles, of Pittsburgh, and Jerome, of Eugene, Ore.       
         Kate Witte Ericson, an artist who collaborated with her husband, Mel Ziegler, on indoor and outdoor installation works noted for their beauty, complexity and  social awareness, died on Sunday at her home in Milanville, Pa. She was 39 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was brain cancer, her husband said.         Ms. Ericson was born in Manhattan in 1955. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982. She and Mr. Ziegler met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy.         One of their first solo shows, at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1986, consisted of a display of all the wood necessary to raise a house,  with each piece carved with a phrase or adage about house or home. At the end of the exhibition, the wood was sold and used in the construction of a house.         Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler exhibited their work in many shows in the United  States and abroad, including the 1989 Whitney Biennial. Their most recent New York exhibition was in 1993 at the Michael Klein Gallery in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Ericson is survived by her parents, H. A. and Alma Ericson, of Norwalk, Conn., and a brother, Scott, of Arlington, Tex.       
         Minna Lederman Daniel, who edited the influential magazine Modern Music for more than 20 years, died on Sunday at the Kateri Residence nursing home in Manhattan. She was 99.         Beginning in 1924, Modern Music chronicled concert music, jazz, musical theater, film, radio and dance in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Although the magazine, which was published quarterly, occasionally featured articles by distinguished European composers (among them Alban Berg, Bela Bartok and Arnold Schoenberg), its importance stemmed from its serious coverage of new American music.         Virgil Thomson, Aaron Copland, John Cage, Elliott Carter, Roger Sessions and Marc Blitzstein were regular contributors. The young Leonard Bernstein wrote for the magazine, as did Edwin Denby, the dance critic, whose career Mrs. Daniel helped nurture.         Mrs. Daniel in turn wielded considerable influence, Joan Peyser wrote in a 1983 article for The New York Times, and "probably shaped pre-World War II American music more than any single composer did."         Minna Lederman was born on March 17, 1896, in Manhattan. She studied music, drama and dance as a child and later attended Barnard College, from which she graduated in 1917.         In 1923 she helped form the League of Composers with a group of musicians and new-music enthusiasts. "Everybody was terribly upset that the first concerts given by the league had been so badly reviewed," she recalled in 1983. "The critics had absolutely no knowledge. At the time we were receiving those splendid little magazines from abroad -- like La Revue Musicale -- and someone said, 'Let's have a magazine.' So I undertook to do it."         The first issue was published in February 1924. It was originally called The  League of Composers' Review, but the name was changed the following year. When the magazine stopped publication in 1946, brought down by rising costs and ideological dissent within the League of Composers, many critics paid tribute. "It afforded information and informed editorial comment upon contemporaneous tendencies in music not to be found elsewhere," Olin Downes wrote in The Times.         Mrs. Daniel continued to write on music and dance. She edited the anthology "Stravinsky in the Theater" (1947) and contributed to American Mercury, Saturday Review, The Nation and other periodicals.         In 1974 she established the Archives of Modern Music in the Library of Congress, and in 1983 she assembled "The Life and Death of a Small Magazine," a  monograph published by the Institute for Studies in American Music. This compilation of articles, written for Modern Music by some of its most celebrated contributors and held together by Mrs. Daniel's commentary, won the ASCAP Deems  Taylor Award for distinguished music criticism in 1984.         Mrs. Daniel's husband, Mell Daniel, a painter, died in 1975.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Marie Callender, a California woman who started baking pies at home for a delicatessen and turned that into a chain of 146 restaurants and a frozen-entree business, died on Saturday at the Rossmoor Regency Residential Community here. She was 88.         The cause was cancer.         Mrs. Callender got into the food business by chance, answering a delicatessen's help-wanted ad, then making pies for the business at home. The shop owner later persuaded her to start her own baking business and sell him pies.         She, her husband and son set up shop in Long Beach in a rented Quonset hut and began selling pies in 1948. Her only child, Donald Callender, sold the company to Ramada Inn in 1986, when it had annual sales of $175 million. About three-fourths of the restaurants are in California.         Mrs. Callender's husband died in 1984. She is survived by her son and three grandchildren.       
         Anne E. Sullivan, a vice president at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, the New York publishing house, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 53 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She died from internal injuries after being struck by a private bus on Friday afternoon at 23d Street and 10th Avenue, according to the publishing house.         At her death, Ms. Sullivan was the director of contracts and copyrights at the publishing house, overseeing its legal operations. She had spent 14 years with the company.         She was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and graduated from Newton College of the Sacred Heart, which has since merged with Boston College, and Fordham University Law School.         Ms. Sullivan is survived by her husband, Alan H. Bomser; her stepmother, Patricia Sullivan of Bronxville; a brother, Eugene Sullivan of Larchmont, N.Y.,  and two sisters, Jane Burke of Bronxville and Mary Tracy of Boston.       
         Mary Beame, the wife of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, died on Tuesday at the New York Medical Center. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Beame was married to the former New York Mayor, who served from 1974 to  1978, for almost 68 years. The two met as teen-agers at the University Settlement House, which provided social services for poor Lower East Side residents.         They married in 1928, and Mr. and Mrs. Beame lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, for more than four decades, until he became Mayor.         Active in charities, she formed the Jennie Levine Cancer League in memory of  a friend who had died of cancer. She was named Woman of the Year in 1973 by the  National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Edmond, of Hamilton, Ontario, and Bernard, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Johnnie Tillmon Blackston, who encountered one officious welfare inspector too many and used her anger to help change the system, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 69.         Her family said the cause was diabetes.         Mrs. Blackston turned her rage over the indignities of a belittling system into a grass-roots movement that won widespread changes and helped make the plight of welfare mothers a feminist issue. And if she did nothing else, she proved that a single mother on welfare can be a woman to be reckoned with.         A sharecropper's daughter who was born in Scott, Ark., and never made it through high school, Mrs. Blackston was accustomed to running her own life. When things went bad in Arkansas, for example, she packed up her children, left her first husband behind and struck out for California in search of a better life.         Mrs. Blackston, who worked in a Los Angeles laundry to support her six children, was not prepared for what she had to endure when she eventually went on welfare, and the system was not prepared for her.         It was the early 1960's, a time, she soon found, when welfare inspectors routinely poked through recipients' refrigerators, demanded to know where they had got the money to buy television sets and staged midnight raids to make sure  they were not harboring men, a violation of the rules for women receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children.         When Mrs. Blackston, who had been a union shop steward, took offense at such  invasions of privacy, she sat down and sent anonymous letters to her neighbors at a Watts housing project, asking those on welfare to come to a protest meeting. More than 300 people showed up.         Within months in 1963, Mrs. Blackston and her friends founded Aid to Needy Children-Mothers Anonymous, linked up with other state groups and inspired the creation of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Over the next several years it successfully campaigned for improvements, removing many of the system's paternalistic trappings and establishing welfare as an enforceable right.         Along the way, Mrs. Blackston not only shaped the national welfare debate, but also changed the very terms of the argument, transforming what had been a concern far down the agenda of the civil rights movement into a compelling feminist issue.         Noting that the vast majority of welfare recipients were women and children and likening welfare to a "supersexist marriage," Mrs. Blackston was unsparing in her analysis in addresses to welfare mothers. As she once put it:         "You trade in 'a' man for 'The' Man. But you can't divorce him if he treats you bad. He can divorce you, of course -- cut you off -- any time he wants. But  in that case, 'he' keeps the kids, not you.         " 'The' Man runs everything. In ordinary marriage, sex is supposed to be for  your husband. On A.F.D.C. you're not supposed to have sex at all. You give up control of your body. It's a condition of aid. 'The' Man, the welfare system, controls your money. 'He' tells you what to buy and what not to buy, where to buy it and what things cost."         After serving as the national organization's executive director until a lack  of money forced it to close the Washington office in 1974, Mrs. Blackston returned to California, where she worked as a legislative aid and served on state and local committees concerned with welfare.         She is survived by her second husband, Harvey Blackston; six children, Marcia Evans of Riverside, Calif., Ronald, Auluavance, Josalyn and Tanya Tillmon of Los Angeles, and Caffie Tillmon of Stockton, Calif.; 20 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Hannah Hirschhorn Baumann, a former national vice president of the American Jewish Committee who was active in many charitable, cultural and religious organizations, died on Sunday at her home in Rye, N.Y. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her son, James, said.         Mrs. Baumann was also a member of the national executive council of the American Jewish Committee and chairwoman of the organization's Westchester chapter. She was a fellow in perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an active supporter of the 92d Street Y and Channel 13. She was also a patron of the United Medical Center in Portchester, N.Y., and a member of the board of the Community Synagogue of Rye.         Mrs. Baumann, who was born in Manhattan, was a daughter of Fred Hirschhorn, the founder and chief executive officer of the General Cigar Company, and the former Hannah deRothschild Sharps. Mrs. Baumann graduated in 1937 from Smith College with a bachelor of arts degree. She worked with the American Red Cross during World War II.         Her husband of 50 years, Jay S. Baumann, the president of Terminal Barber Shops and treasurer of Sierra Realty Corporation, died in 1991. In addition to their son, James S. Baumann of Manhattan, Mrs. Baumann is survived by a sister,  Susan Behrend of Philadelphia, and a brother, Fred Hirschhorn Jr. of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Ethel T. Chamberlain, who dedicated her life to the Salvation Army and served as national president of its women's organizations from 1974 to 1977, died on Wednesday at a Salvation Army retirement home in Asbury Park, N.J. She was 86.         From the time she attended an open air meeting as a 9-year-old in Malone, N.Y., Mrs. Chamberlain was devoted to the Salvation Army and its principles of service to others. She entered its training school in the Bronx at the age of 17 and spent her entire career with the religious and philanthropic organization.         An inspirational speaker who filled church pews in the 1950's, 60's, and 70's, starting in a time when women were rarely allowed at church pulpits, Mrs.  Chamberlain encouraged women to transcend sexual stereotypes. She served on the  National Board of Directors of Church Women United and was the keynote speaker at the first "International Year of the Woman" Conference in Mexico City in 1975.         Mrs. Chamberlain also organized and directed the Salvation Army's service program during World War II. Among her other jobs for the organization, she was  president of its women's organizations in the West Indies and Caribbean Territory and territorial president of its Women's Services in the southern states and Mexico.         Her husband, William E. Chamberlain, was the Salvation Army's national president.         Mrs. Chamberlain is survived by four daughters, Alice Baxendale of Clearwater, Fla., Jean C. Mosher of DeWitt, N.Y., Roberta C. Schofield of Cazenovia, N.Y., and Carol Appleby of Columbia, S.C.; 10 grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren, and two sisters, Helen Covell of Tucson, Ariz., and Erma Mowers of Syracuse, N.Y.

         Judith Lane Rand, a novelist who also worked in radio and advertising, died on Nov. 21 at her home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. She was 64.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Rand wrote daily radio shows for James Beard, Arlene Francis, Dorothy and Mary Rodgers and Dione Lucas, among others. She also contributed articles to New York magazine and was the author of several novels, including "Fevered Sands." One of her books, "Paper Castles," was the basis of a 1984 CBS movie, "He's Fired, She's Hired." With her husband, John, she wrote and produced "Quick Changes," a satirical revue that had a successful run in Chicago. She also wrote two award-winning industrial films.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Eliza Damiecki  of Bridgehampton, L.I., and Hilary Adams of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Monday in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J. Kahn, who made a fortune in real estate, cotton and oil.         By the time of Mr. Kahn's death in 1984, the couple had given away $5 million, including $1 million each to their respective colleges, Smith and the University of Pennsylvania, and $1 million for the Dallas Public Library to buy  books. Since her husband's death, Mrs. Kahn had donated more than $15 million to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University and other beneficiaries. Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Rebecca C. McGreevy, a senior vice president of public relations at the Estee Lauder Companies, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 62.         The cause of death was heart failure, a company spokeswoman said.         Mrs. McGreevy joined Estee Lauder, the cosmetics and perfume company, as a publicity director in 1966. She was promoted to vice president of public relations in 1971 and to senior vice president in 1981.         After graduating from Emory University in 1955, Mrs. McGreevy worked at the Georgia Motor Club, an automobile owners' group. She started in the publicity department at Elizabeth Arden in 1957, where she remained until she joined Estee Lauder. She received an M.B.A. from New York University in 1984.         Mrs. McGreevy is survived by her husband, Charles, of Manhattan, and her sister, Carol Donahoe of Denver.       
         Evangeline Bruce, the widow of one of the most influential diplomats of the cold war and one of Washington's last grand hostesses, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 77.         Mrs. Bruce -- whose husband, David K. E. Bruce, was the United States envoy to France, Germany, Britain, China and NATO before his death in 1977 -- was known for her legendary soirees at their Georgetown home, at once properly old-fashioned and glitteringly up to the minute. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis once sent her a note praising "the bright path you cut through an age where so few people have grace and imagination and the virtues of another time."         Mrs. Onassis added: "One was so proud as an American to think that other countries recognized you as our very best."         Mrs. Bruce's A-list guests were politicians, literati and celebrities whose names often turned up in newspaper articles, diplomatic cables or campaign-contribution reports: Katharine Graham, Vernon E. Jordan, David Brinkley, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington.         But despite her undisputed place at the center of Washington's social whirl for nearly 50 years, she shunned what she called the "H" word.         "Hostess -- that one I really resent," she once said. She was equally adamant that she did not preside over a salon.         "I don't think any gathering in Washington includes the main ingredients of a salon," she said in 1984. "The French would say that a salon is like- minded people getting together to converse on literature, art, history and politics. The tone has to be light, humorous, witty and, the more elusive the reference, the more prized. In Washington we don't go in for elusive statements. We are not particularly well-read and therefore even the deft allusions are lost."         Instead, Mrs. Bruce said, the talk in Washington tended to be "strictly nuts  and bolts."         "It is rare here to discuss things in conceptual or philosophical terms," she said. "I like living here better than anyplace else in the world, but the first  thing I notice when I leave to spend some time in Europe is the conversation, the variety, the nonphilistine approach."         A diplomat's daughter who had lived in a dozen countries before going to Radcliffe in 1937 to study Chinese history and French literature, Mrs. Bruce moved to London during World War II to work in the London office of the O.S.S.,  the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. One day her boss began questioning her about the languages she spoke.         "I suppose you speak Italian," he said. She said yes.         "German." She nodded.         "French." Again, yes.         "Well, you certainly don't speak Japanese and Chinese," he said.         "Well," she said, "it happens that I do, sir, because my father was stationed in both countries."         With that, David K. E. Bruce invited her to lunch.         "I know it's a tired old cliche," Mrs. Bruce told Vanity Fair magazine, "but  we were partners in every sense of the word. For instance, from day one in Paris, David expected me to be solely responsible for all the diplomatic entertaining, which forced me to get over my shyness."         Her husband, who worked for every President from Harry S. Truman to Gerald R. Ford, was called out of retirement to head the American delegation at the Paris  peace talks on Vietnam in 1970, and again in 1973 to be chief of the United States mission to Beijing. There Mrs. Bruce learned to address Chinese as "comrade," except when speaking to two male servants who were addressed as "mister."         In China, Mrs. Bruce found that she had more time to herself than in earlier  postings. She spent some of it writing a book-length manuscript about the year 1795 in France.         She lined up a publisher but shelved the project until a couple of years ago, when she rewrote the manuscript as "Napoleon and Josephine: An Improbable Marriage." Its publication by Lisa Drew/Scribner earlier this year was met with  interest in some quarters, incredulity in others. William Doyle, in The New York Times Book Review, called it "an extremely readable account of their lives together, and an easy and attractive introduction to Napoleon and his private life" despite a number of errors of fact, date and sequence.         Mrs. Bruce started a Washington organization for runaways and abused teen-agers, the Sasha Bruce Youthwork Inc., in the 1970's. It was named for Mrs. Bruce's 28-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who was known as Sasha and was shot to  death on the family estate in Virginia in 1975. Her husband of three months was  later indicted. By then he had moved to Athens and, as a Greek national, he could not be extradited.         Mrs. Bruce is survived by two sons, David Jr. and Nicholas.       
         Vivian Blaine, who created the role of the ditsy "well-known fiancee" Miss Adelaide in the original production of "Guys and Dolls," died on Saturday at Beth Israel Medical Center North in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Claire Chapman, a friend.         Guys and Dolls," the Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows musical based on stories by Damon Runyon, was the sensation of the 1950 Broadway season, and Ms. Blaine was irresistible as the blond chanteuse at the Hot Box club who was hopelessly engaged to Nathan Detroit (Sam Levene), the operator of the "oldest established  permanent floating crap game in New York."         Ms. Blaine sang "A Bushel and a Peck," "Take Back Your Mink" and "Adelaide's  Lament," which with its refrain "a person could develop a cold," routinely brought the house down. "Sung in the squeaky, nasal New Yorkese that characterizes Adelaide, the Lament is an unforgettable show stopper," Collier's  magazine wrote in 1951. "Night after night, the house listens to Adelaide's complaints in an exhilarated hush."         Ms. Blaine was born in Newark. Originally her last name was Stapleton. While  she was still in elementary school, her father, a theatrical agent, booked $1-a-night singing dates for her at nightclubs, company parties and police benefits. At 14 she began singing with the Halsey Miller Orchestra, and after graduating from Southside High School went on the road with little-known bands.         In 1941, when she was singing at the Governor Clinton Hotel in Manhattan, her picture appeared in a newspaper, and a talent scout for 20th Century Fox invited her to take a screen test. Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of the studio, liked what  he saw and signed her to a contract.         Initially, Ms. Blaine languished. She was assigned some small parts and, after performing on the U.S.O. circuit, appeared in "Jitterbugs" (1943) with Laurel and Hardy. After storming into Zanuck's office and threatening to quit, she won a lead role in the musical "Greenwich Village" (1944). With an eye to the new Technicolor process, the studio dyed her blond hair red and promoted her as "the cherry blonde."         Her films of the 40's were limited to forgettable musicals like "Something for the Boys" (1944), "Doll Face" (1945), "Three Little Girls in Blue" (1946) and "If I'm Lucky" (1945). She did better as Joan Bennett's rival for George Raft in "Nob Hill" (1945) and as the dance-band singer Emily in the Rodgers and  Hammerstein musical "State Fair" (1945).         Ms. Blaine won the role of Adelaide by chance. Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin, the producers of "Guys and Dolls," had turned her down for the part of Sarah Brown, the Mission Doll, telling her that her personality was too strong for the ingenue role. As luck would have it, she ran into the two men several months later on Broadway, at a time when they were having casting problems. A hasty audition was arranged, and Ms. Blaine won the part.         At first it wasn't much, just a few lines of dialogue attached to two songs.  At one point, Ms. Blaine considered dropping out of the production in frustration. "That part was virtually written as the play was rehearsed," said Manny Franks, her husband and agent, in a 1952 interview. "Vivian would suggest  things she had thought out for Miss Adelaide to do. Before long Miss Adelaide became one of the strongest elements in the show, simply because an actress had  put her mind to making something out of nothing."         Ms. Blaine played Adelaide for five years, with a brief interruption to make  the movie musical "Skirts Ahoy." She also played the role in the 1955 film version by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit in a cast that also included Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons. She played the role once more in a 1966 revival of the musical.         She appeared on Broadway in "A Hatful of Rain" (1956), replacing Shelley Winters; "Say, Darling" (1958), "Enter Laughing" (1963), "Company" (1971) and, briefly, "Zorba" (1984).         From 1951 to 1952 she appeared on television in "Those Two," a musical situation comedy with Pinky Lee. She also had roles in the films "Public Pigeon  No. 1" (1957), "Richard" (1972), "The Dark" (1979)" and "Parasite" (1982).         Ms. Blaine was married three times. The marriages ended in divorce.       
         Nancy LaMott, a cabaret singer and recording artist whose unadorned, heartfelt interpretations of songs epitomized the best of what could be called an all-American style of traditional pop singing, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 43.         The cause was cancer, said her manager, Scott Barnes.         In the last two years, Ms. LaMott had achieved a national reputation, and her recently released fifth album, "Listen to My Heart" (Midder Music), recorded with the arranger Peter Matz, received critical acclaim. In a cabaret field typified by showy histrionics, Ms. LaMott was a singularly unaffected voice. She brought to everything she sang a clean, clear sense of line, impeccable enunciation and a deep understanding of how a good song could convey a lifetime's experience.         Ms. LaMott, born in Midland, Mich., was a self-taught musician who began singing with her father's band in her hometown. In the late 1970's, she moved to San Francisco, where she sang at the Plush Room and other local clubs. Arriving  in New York in the early 1980's, she worked as a cocktail waitress and a singer  at the Duplex and Don't Tell Mama. She also did demonstration records of theater songs by composers like Alan Menken, Marvin Hamlisch and Cy Coleman. In 1983, she was featured in the cabaret revue "It's Better With a Band," a show at Don't Tell Mama that featured the lyrics of David Zippel. The next year, she teamed up with Christopher Marlowe, who became her longtime accompanist and musical director.         In 1990, she met the composer David Friedman and his companion, Mr. Barnes, who became her manager. Together with Mr. Zippel they produced her first album,  "Beautiful Baby," in 1991. Four more recordings followed. For her second album,  "Come Rain or Come Shine: The Songs of Johnny Mercer" (1993), she was named best female vocalist by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets. The following year, her third album, "My Foolish Heart," was chosen record of the year by the same organization. Her fourth album, a holiday collection, "Just in Time for Christmas," was released a year ago.         Ms. LaMott was plagued with illness for much of her life. At 17, she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an ulcerative intestinal disorder. An operation  in 1993 reversed many of her symptoms and allowed her recording and singing career to blossom. In addition to her recordings, she made television appearances on "Good Morning America," "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," "Today" and "The Charles Grodin Show."         She is survived by her husband, Peter Zapp, an actor whom she married on her  deathbed; by her parents, Judy and Jack LaMott, and three brothers and three sisters.       
         Dorothy Porter Wesley, a librarian who played the primary role in building Howard University's collection of books and other materials for the study of black history and culture, died on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at the home  of her daughter, where she had moved recently from Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Wesley retired in 1973 as the curator of the Moorland-Spingarn Research  Center, a center for research involving documents about black history and kindred fields. The center is on the Howard campus in Washington.         She began acquiring books and other materials in 1930 and from then until 1973, the center's holdings grew to 180,000 items from 3,000. They include letters, manuscripts, pamphlets, books, oral-history materials and microfilms.         The centeris one of the world's largest repositories of materials for studying black history and culture, its current director, Dr. Thomas C. Battle,  said yesterday.         Over the years, Mrs. Wesley was also known by the surname Porter and the double surname Porter Wesley. Her 1971 book, "Early Negro Writings 1760-1837" was republished this fall, by Black Classic Press, with her name given as Dorothy Porter.         She began working at Howard in 1928 as a library cataloger and was named, in  1930, librarian of what was to become the Moorland-Spingarn center's collection. At the time, it was called the Moorland Foundation because it consisted chiefly  of a books donated by Dr. Jesse Moorland, a Howard trustee; in 1946 the book collection of Arthur B. Spingarn was added to it.         Mrs. Wesley's other writings include the books "North American Negro Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist" (1945), "Negro Protest Pamphlets" (1969) and "The Negro in the United States: A Selected Bibliography" (1970).         Mrs. Wesley, whose maiden name was Burnett, was born in Warrenton, Va., and reared in Montclair, N.J. She went received a bachelor's degree in 1928 from Howard and a master's degree in library science in 1932 from Columbia University.         Her first husband, James Amos Porter, who had headed Howard's fine arts department, died in 1970. She married Charles Harris Wesley, an authority on black history and former professor and dean at Howard, in 1979. He died in 1987.         Her survivors include her daughter, Constance Burnett Porter Uzelac of Fort Lauderdale.       
         Alexina Duchamp, the widow of Marcel Duchamp, died on Wednesday at her home in Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris. She was 89.         As a former daughter-in-law of Henri Matisse, the widow of Duchamp and a close friend of John Cage and Jasper Johns, she was in her later years the unquestioned doyenne of the survivors of a great age in art, dance and music.         She had close ties to Philadelphia and took pride in being an honorary trustee of its Museum of Art, which has by far the largest collection of Duchamp's work. She was delighted when in 1967 his last major work, the scenographic "Etant Donnes," or "Given," was installed there.         "Etant Donnes" had been built in secret in New York between 1964 and 1966, a  time when Duchamp was believed to have stopped working forever. During much of its construction, Mrs. Duchamp was her husband's sole confidante.         Alexina Sattler was born in Cincinnati on Jan. 6, 1906, the daughter of Dr. Robert Sattler, an ophthalmologist who ran his own hospital with a free clinic attached, and his second wife, the former Agnes Mitchell.         She at first thought of becoming an artist and for a time studied sculpture with Brancusi in Paris. In December 1929 she married the son of Henri Matisse, Pierre, who was to become a distinguished art dealer on Madison Avenue. When her husband was mobilized in Paris at the outbreak of World War II, she ran the gallery for some months.         After a divorce from Pierre Matisse in 1949, she married Duchamp in 1954. They lived in New York, in Paris and in the summer in Cadaques in northern Spain. After Duchamp's death in 1968, she became close to the composer Cage and  to a new circle of friends.         She is survived by the three children of her marriage to Matisse, Jacqueline, Paul and Peter, and by 12 grandchildren.       
         Elisabeth Leustig, a casting agent whose credits included "A River Runs Through It," "Dances With Wolves" and "The Bodyguard," was killed on Tuesday in  a Moscow traffic accident. She was 50.         The Moscow police said Ms. Leustig, in town to work on the planned movie "The Saint," was killed in a hit-and-run accident Tuesday night on Tverskaya Street,  a downtown thoroughfare. The driver was not found.         Ms. Leustig was nominated by the Casting Society of America for her work on  "A River Runs Through It" (1992) and this year's "500 Nations." Her film credits also included "Rapa Nui," "The Scarlet Letter" and the forthcoming "Kansas City," directed by Robert Altman.         She was was born in France and began her career at the Los Angeles Actors Theater. She worked at Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios and at the Casting Company, after which she went into business for herself.         "The Saint" is to be directed by Phillip Noyce ("Patriot Games") for Paramount Pictures. The lead role of Simon Templar has not been cast.         Ms. Leustig is survived by her husband, a brother and a sister.       
         Lillian Teit Zabar, who fled the pogroms of her homeland, came to the United  States and became part of an American success story, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 90, or perhaps 92 or 93.         Mrs. Zabar was a founder with her husband, Louis, of Zabar's gourmet delicatessen and food emporium on Broadway at 80th Street in Manhattan. The business was started in 1934 and now has about 35,000 customers a week and $40 million in sales a year, her sons Stanley and Saul said last night.         Mrs. Zabar marked her 90th birthday on the day she died, but her sons said she was almost certainly two or three years older. When she came to the United States from Ukraine in the mid-1920's, she shaved some years off her age out of  fear that the immigration authorities would send her back as too old, her sons said.         Nor was it known with certainty that Dec. 22 was her date of birth. But she knew she was born during Hanukkah, so her birthday was celebrated during the holiday every year, her sons explained.         His mother's life was "the classic American success story," Saul Zabar said last night.         She came to America alone and settled first with relatives in Philadelphia. Later, she moved to New York City, where she met Louis Zabar, an old acquaintance from their Ukrainian village. They soon married.         Mr. Zabar headed the smoked-fish section of a food store, and Mrs. Zabar was  an accomplished cook. They started their modest deli in Brooklyn and moved it to Manhattan a half-century ago.         Saul and Stanley Zabar, who live in Manhattan and are still associated with the business founded by their parents, said last night that their mother was a gifted maker of blintzes, potato salad, stuffed cabbage and coleslaw. Besides which, they said, she kept house and raised three sons.         Louis Zabar died in 1950. Mrs. Zabar's second husband, Louis Chartoff, died about 15 years ago. Surviving are another son, Eli, a Manhattan restaurateur; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Madge Sinclair, an actress who appeared on television and in film, died on Wednesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 57.         She had had leukemia for 13 years, said an ABC spokeswoman, Julian Myers.         Ms. Sinclair, who played Bell in the 1977 ABC mini-series "Roots," was born  in Kingston, Jamaica. She was a schoolteacher until she moved to New York City at the age of 30.         Her early credits included the role of Clytemnestra in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of "The Wedding of Iphigenia" in 1971. She made  her film debut in 1974, opposite Jon Voight in "Conrack."         She received five nominations for Emmy Awards, and won for her work in the critically acclaimed "Gabriel's Fire," which ran on ABC from 1990-92. She played the owner of a cafe frequented by the title character, a former convict played by James Earl Jones.         She also appeared on the television shows "Grandpa Goes to Washington," "Trapper John, M.D.," "Me and the Boys" and "Look Away."         Her most recent movie work was as the voice of the Lion Queen in "The Lion King" (1994), and she played Eddie Murphy's mother in "Coming to America" (1988).         She was the recipient of several awards, including the Order of Distinction bestowed by the Prime Minister of Jamaica and two Image Awards from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Ms. Sinclair also appearing in seven plays at the Los Angeles Theater Center  and in "Division Street" at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband, Dean Compton, her sons, her mother and a sister.       
         Lillian Teit Zabar, who fled the pogroms of her homeland, came to the United  States and became part of an American success story, died Friday in Manhattan. She was 90, or perhaps 92 or 93.         Mrs. Zabar was a founder with her husband, Louis, of Zabar's gourmet delicatessen and food emporium on Broadway at 80th Street in Manhattan. The business was started in 1934 and now has about 35,000 customers a week and $40 million in sales a year, her sons Stanley and Saul said.

         Connie Boucher, a pioneer in licensing cartoon characters who provided the inspiration for "Happiness Is a Warm Puppy," a best-selling 1962 book about Snoopy, the "Peanuts" comic strip character, died on Dec. 20 in San Francisco of complications after heart surgery. She was 72.         Ms. Boucher was a window dresser for I. Magnin, a San Francisco Bay area women's clothier, in 1959 when she grew dissatisfied with the quality of coloring books available for her two sons. With her husband, Jim Young, she created a Winnie-the-Pooh coloring book, using a character that was in the public domain. The book sold 50,000 copies.         Two years later, she founded Determined Productions Inc. to develop other products based on licensing characters. One of her first efforts was a calendar  using the characters in the "Peanuts" comic strip.         "What made her different was the quality and originality of her ideas," Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist, said yesterday. "She proposed the date book in 1961, and now everyone is doing them. After that, she started doing sweatshirts and banners and all that. She kind of set a standard for licensing,  which up until she came along had not always been that high."         Mr. Schulz said that the second year's calendar sold twice as well and that they began discussing his desire to publish books using Charlie Brown and other  characters. Until then, he said, publishers had been interested only in reprints of his comic strips.         "She had seen the strip I had drawn where Snoopy is being hugged by Charlie Brown and Charlie Brown says, 'Happiness is a warm puppy,' " Mr. Schulz said. "Connie said that maybe this could become a good book, and I said I didn't know  if I could think of any more of those ideas. That day, after she left, I wrote virtually all the ideas in 'Happiness Is a Warm Puppy' and it was the best-selling book the next year."         The book spent 45 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, reaching No.  2.         Five years ago, Ms. Boucher's company helped underwrite a show at the Louvre  in Paris celebrating 40 years of Snoopy.         In recent years, Ms. Boucher turned her attention to conservation issues. She helped arrange product licensing to benefit the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations. She was also nominated for an Academy Award for producing "Amazon Diary," a short live-action film, a spokeswoman for her company, Jaymi Horn, said.         In addition to her husband and business partner, Ms. Boucher is survived by a sister, June Dutton of Sausalito, Calif; two sons, Douglas, of Belvedere, Calif., and Theodore, of Davis, Calif., and five grandchildren.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Nov. 27 in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J. Kahn, who made a fortune in real estate, cotton and oil.         By the time of Mr. Kahn's death in 1984, the couple had given away $5 million, including $1 million each to their respective colleges, Smith and the University of Pennsylvania, and $1 million for the Dallas Public Library to buy  books. Since her husband's death, Mrs. Kahn had donated more than $15 million to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University and other beneficiaries. Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Gretchen Geber, a cello instructor whose students have gone on to play in major American orchestras, died on Saturday at her home in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81.         Mrs. Geber studied briefly at the University of Southern California and later taught there while pursuing studio work and performing.         Among her students are current members of symphonies in Los Angeles and New  Orleans, said her husband, Edwin, a retired cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Geber is survived by two sons, Stephen, the  principal cellist with the Cleveland Orchestra, and David, a cellist with the American String Quartet and chairman of the Manhattan School of Music's string department, and six grandchildren.       
         Heida Hermanns, a pianist, teacher and philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 89.         Mrs. Hermanns was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1906. She received her first piano lessons from her mother, Alice Goldschmidt Hermanns, and when she was 15 she enrolled at the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. Her teachers included Egon Petri, Artur Schnabel, Carl Friedberg and Isabella Vengerova.         She made her debut with the Berlin Philharmonic when she was 18 and toured Europe as a recitalist and concerto soloist through the 1920's and early 1930's. In 1931 she married Artur Holde, a music critic and author. They immigrated to the United States in 1936.         Mrs. Hermanns made her New York debut at Town Hall in 1942, and gave annual recitals that often included works by Busoni, Dussek, Kodaly and other composers whose works were not in the mainstream repertory. Her interest in unusual works  brought her to the attention of the Society for Forgotten Music, with which she  appeared several times.         As a chamber music player, Mrs. Hermanns performed regularly with John Corigliano, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic (and the father of the composer of the same name). She also gave duo-piano recitals and made recordings with Ruth Steinkraus Cohen.         In the late 1940's, Mrs. Hermanns and Mr. Holde moved to Westport, where they helped start the Friends of Music, an organization that presented chamber music concerts, there. Mrs. Hermanns was also a founder of Performers of Connecticut, which arranged performance opportunities for young musicians and ran a contest that two years ago was renamed the Heida Hermanns Young Performers Competition.         She was also a supporter of the Levitt Pavilion for the Performing Arts. When the Westport Arts Center was built in the mid-1980's, she underwrote its concert hall, which is called Artur Holde Hall after her husband, who died in 1962.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Rosalind K. Loring, a specialist in continuing education, adviser to Federal  agencies and university administrator, died on Dec. 18 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Over the years, Mrs. Loring was a consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, president of the Adult Education Association/ U.S.A. and a board member of the National University Extension Association. She retired in 1984 as associate provost for extended education at the University of Southern California.         She was born in Philadelphia and graduated in art and education from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she also earned a master's degree in adult education. In the late 1950's, U.C.L.A. engaged her to implement her ideas on improving the educational and professional status of women. To that end she developed programs of continuing education for women and similar ones to raise the educational levels of veterans.         Mrs. Loring is survived by her husband of more than 50 years, Murrel Loring;  a daughter, Sherry Loring-Warren of Los Angeles; a son, David, of Reno; a sister, Lois Mudrick of Los Angeles, and three grandsons.       
         Irene Corbally Kuhn, a journalist who traveled on five continents and wrote books as well as newspaper and magazine articles and columns, died yesterday at  the Briar Crest-Deaconess Nursing Home in Concord, Mass., where she had lived for the last year. She was 97 and had spent all of her earlier life, when she was not traveling, in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kuhn's many writings included a volume of memoirs, "Assigned to Adventure" (1938), which Augusta Tucker, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called "the story of an unafraid woman who has seen a lot of the world as a newspaper reporter" and added that it "has pace, it has interest, it has color, and the woman who wrote it has sense: a quality not consistently present  in the kiss-and-tell books of some of the male correspondents.".         Mrs. Kuhn was born in Greenwich Village and studied at Marymount College in  Tarrytown, N.Y., and at Columbia University. After reporting for The Syracuse Herald and working in Paris for The Chicago Tribune, she went to China in 1922 and became a reporter for the English-language Shanghai Evening News and then for the International News Service in Honolulu.         In 1926 she returned to New York City, joined The Daily News, and concentrated on feature writing. She spent a few years as a staff reporter for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, and after returning briefly to The Daily News and working for other news organizations, in 1939 she joined the National Broadcasting Company, for which she reported and worked in other capacities until 1950.         In 1939, she was a founding member of the Overseas Press Club of New York.         After leaving NBC, she wrote a syndicated column and did other writing, including reminiscences that appeared in Gourmet magazine in the 1970's and 1980's.         Her husband, Bert L. Kuhn, also a journalist, died in 1926 after four years of marriage. She is survived by a daughter, Rene Kuhn Bryant of Lexington, Mass.; a granddaughter, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Roxie Roker, a star of the long-running CBS television series "The Jeffersons," died on Saturday, her publicity agent said. She was 66.         Her family, including her son, Lenny Kravitz, the rock guitarist and singer,  declined to release further details, said the publicity agent, Cynthia Snyder.         Ms. Roker was born in Miami. She grew up in Brooklyn, earned a drama degree  from Howard University in Washington and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-on-Avon, England. While holding an office job at NBC in New York in the 1960's, she appeared in Off Broadway shows, including Jean Genet's play "The Blacks." In 1967-68, she was a host of "Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant," a community-oriented show on WNEW-TV.         After resigning from NBC and turning full time to acting, Ms. Roker appeared  onstage with the Negro Ensemble Company in "Ododo" and "Rosalee Pritchet." She won an Obie Award, and was a 1974 Tony nominee for her performance as Mattie Williams in "The River Niger." Her other Off Broadway credits include "Behold! Cometh the Vanderkellans" (1971) and "Jamimma" (1972).         Ms. Roker moved to California when the producer Norman Lear cast her in "The  Jeffersons," a 1975 spinoff of his series "All in the Family." The new show moved Archie Bunker's black neighbors, the Jeffersons, from a blue-collar Queens neighborhood to a luxury apartment house in Manhattan.         The character played by Ms. Roker, Helen Willis, was a black woman with a white husband, Tom (Franklin Cover), television's first interracial couple. They were neighbors of George and Louise Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford), and the Willises' daughter eventually married the Jeffersons' son, Lionel. "The Jeffersons" ran for 10 years.         Ms. Roker later made guest appearances in other television series and specials and returned to the stage. She appeared in a stage production of "The Jeffersons" and toured with Mary Martin and Carol Channing in "Legends."         Her community work, including her role as a board member of the Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, earned her two citations from the Los Angeles City Council.         A marriage to Sy Kravitz, a former NBC executive, ended in divorce, said a spokesman for Virgin Records, their son's recording company.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Albert Roker, and a granddaughter, Zoe.       
         Susie C. Bradley, the mother of Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, died last Thursday in Palm Beach, Fla., where she had made her home since the early 1970's. Mrs. Bradley was 86.         Her funeral was held yesterday at Grace Presbyterian Church in Crystal City,  Mo., where the senator grew up. Mrs. Bradley was active in the church, in Crystal City and in Palm Beach.         Her husband, Warren, died in 1994. In addition to her son, who lives in Montclair, N.J., Mrs. Bradley is survived by a sister, Hardeman Bond of Crystal  City, and a granddaughter.       
         Eleanor Brown Gambee, a horticulturist, writer and civic worker, died on Saturday at her home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         For five decades, Mrs. Gambee devoted her time and active support to the New  York Botanical Garden. As a lecturer and freelance writer, she discussed herbs and horticulture and contributed articles to horticultural journals and other publications.         She was a past vice president of the Planned Parenthood Association of Bergen County, president of the Herb Society of America and member of the editorial board of Vassar Alumnae Magazine.         Mrs. Gambee, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Vassar College and did postgraduate work at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. She  was a past trustee of the Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, the Social Service Federation of Englewood and other community organizations.         Mrs. Gambee is survived by three sons, Sumner, of San Pedro, Calif., Craig, of Nantucket, Mass., and Robert, of Rye, N.Y.; a daughter, Fay Gambee of Manhattan, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Her husband, A. Sumner Gambee, died in 1978.       
         Lois Moss Rothenberg, a benefactor of Jewish and other causes, died on Friday at New York University Hospital. She was 60 and had homes in Manhattan, Ventnor, N.J., and Boca Raton, Fla.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rothenberg was born in Manhattan and graduated from Wellesley College,  whose alumni association she supported. She was a past president of the Jewish Family Service of Atlantic County and chairwoman of the Lion of Judah for the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. She was also a volunteer for Meals on Wheels in New York.         She is survived by her husband, Herbert, a son, John S., of Las Vegas, and a  daughter, Anne Rothenberg of Taunton, Mass.       
         Miriam Camps, who wrote about European unification and other topics and who had been a State Department official, died on Friday in a hospital near her home in Little Abingdon outside Cambridge, England. She was 78.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Margaret Schwartz.         Mrs. Camps was born Miriam Camp in Lynn, Mass. She was the first woman to be vice chairman of the State Department's Planning Council, from 1968 to 1970.         After earning degrees at Mount Holyoke and Bryn Mawr colleges, she joined the State Department during World War II and went on to work at the United States Embassy in London. She worked for the State Department in Washington from 1947 to 1953, then resigned to marry William Anthony Camps, a classicist at Cambridge University.         Her many subsequent writings included the books "Britain the the European Community" (1964), "What Kind of Europe?" (1965) and "European Unification in the Sixties" (1966). She was active in a variety of organizations concerned with foreign affairs.         In addition to her husband and her sister, Margaret Schwartz of Endicott, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Paul R. Camp of Orono, Maine.       
         Felicia Geffen, a former executive director of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, died on Dec. 21 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         She had been suffering from leukemia and osteoporosis, said her daughter, Eloise B. Segal.         Miss Geffen was born in New York City on Feb. 16, 1903. She was a graduate of Hunter College and studied music before becoming an administrative assistant to the conductor and composer Walter Damrosch, whom she succeeded as director of the academy in 1941. Upon her retirement in 1973 she was presented with an award for distinguished service to the arts.         Ms. Geffen's husband, the muralist Stuyvesant Van Veen, died in 1988.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Valerie Cossart, an actress who appeared in many Broadway and Off Broadway productions in the 1930's and 40's, died on Dec. 31 at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was pneumonia, said her stepdaughter, Valerie Livingston Hopkins.         Valerie Cossart Livingston was born in London, the daughter of a well-known British actor, Ernest Cossart. She made her theatrical debut as a child, in a production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in which her father played the role of Bottom.         Her adult debut was in New York City, in a 1930 production of "Lost Sheep." Her other stage credits include "Call It a Day" (1935), "Shadow and Substance" (1939), "The Haven" (1947) and several productions of Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit."         In the late 1940's and early 50's she appeared on television, in programs including "Kraft Television Theater," "The Defenders" and "The First Hundred Years," television's first long-running soap opera. She was seen in the films "Edward My Son," "Fail Safe" and "The Verdict."         Mrs. Livingston's husband, Graham, died in 1973.         In addition to her stepdaughter, of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., she is survived by a stepson, Henry Stevenson Livingston of Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.       
         Elaine Sulka, the director of the National Shakespeare Company and of the Cubiculo theater in New York City, died on Dec. 24 at her home in Manhattan. She was 61.         The cause was a heart attack, said Joanne Joseph, a friend.         Ms. Sulka trained in sociology and received a master's degree from Brown University before turning to theater. She studied acting with Jules Irving and Herbert Blau at the San Francisco Actors Workshop and with Paul Mann in New York. She performed in many regional theater productions and on and off Broadway through last summer, including Goneril to Morris Carnovsky's Lear at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn.; the title role in "Medea" at Circle in the Square; Olivia in "Twelfth Night" at the Globe Theater in San Diego, and a lead role in the Broadway production of Paddy Chayefsky's "Passion of Josef D." In recent years she toured in two one-woman productions, "Mothers" and "A Woman in Love -- With Shakespeare."         Ms. Sulka founded the National Shakespeare Company in 1963 with Philip Meister, her husband, with the aim of taking Shakespeare to schools and universities on bus tours throughout the country. In 1968, the couple founded the Cubiculo, a small, lively center for new theater, dance, film and poetry, in a brownstone in Clinton. The center, which included a 75-seat theater and a studio theater, was a popular and affordable place to experiment, with Ms. Sulka, tall, dark-eyed and stylishly exuberant, serving at times as the evening's hostess. The Cubiculo is the home of the National Shakespeare Company, which will continue under the direction of Greg Lombardo and Tom Trudgeon.         Mr. Meister died in 1982. Ms. Sulka is survived by her mother, Anna, of Maspeth, Queens; a daughter, Deirdre, of El Paso, Tex., and two sisters, Barbara Bonomi and Marie Schaefer. A memorial service is to be held on Jan. 21 at 6 P.M. at the Cubiculo, 414 West 51st Street.       
         Cleo Rickman Fitch, an archeological researcher who specialized in Roman lamps, died on Sunday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1962, she joined an excavation of the ancient town of Cosa, north of Rome, and continued her work into the 1980's.         The book "Cosa: The Lamps," which she wrote with Dr. Norma Goldman of Wayne State University, was issued last fall as part of the American Academy series through the University of Michigan Press.         She was born in Carlsbad, Tex., and received a bachelor's degree from Peabody College in Nashville.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. James Marston Fitch, the architectural historian and critic, and a brother, John Rickman of Chapel Hill, Tenn.       
         Gertrude Fogelson, a New York philanthropist and artist, died on Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Fogelson was honorary chairwoman and a longtime benefactor of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan. She was a fellow of Brandeis University and a member of its creative arts committee.         She was a trustee of the Joe and Emily Lowe Foundation in Palm Beach, which supports Jewish and other charitable causes. The foundation last reported assets of $21 million and expenditures of $1.45 million in 1992.         Mrs. Fogelson, who was born in the Bronx, worked as a health-education teacher and stockbroker.         She is survived by her husband of 64 years, David, a retired corporate lawyer; a daughter, Ellen Liman of Manhattan; two sisters, Annette Bloch of Manhattan and Frances Epstein of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Kay Brown Barrett, who bought "Gone With the Wind" for the movie producer David O. Selznick after discovering the novel as his New York representative, died yesterday at the Meadow Lakes retirement community in Hightstown, N.J., where she had lived for the last 14 years. She was 93.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Laurinda Barrett.         In 1986, on the 50th anniversary of the sale of Margaret Mitchell's novel to the movies, Mrs. Barrett recalled that when she told Mr. Selznick she thought the book was "absolutely wonderful," he replied, "A Civil War story won't go."         But when Mr. Selznick's financial backer, John Hay (Jock) Whitney agreed to buy the rights even if Mr. Selznick was not interested in the property, Mr. Selznick changed his attitude. And, Mrs. Barrett noted, "when he did buy it, he made a wonderful, wonderful picture."         Securing "Gone With the Wind" was far from Mrs. Barrett's sole triumph. In a long career as representative, talent scout and powerful agent with Leland Hayward, MCA and ICM, she brought other novels, like Edna Ferber's "Cimarron" and Daphne du Maurier's "Rebecca," to the attention of her employers. She also persuaded Ingrid Bergman to leave Stockholm for Hollywood; signed Laurence Olivier to his first American contract, and coaxed Alfred Hitchcock into signing with the Selznick studio.         She represented Alec Guinness, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Rex Harrison, Fredric March, Patricia Neal and Montgomery Clift. Her clients also included Lillian Hellman, Isak Dinesen and, for 40 years, Arthur Miller. Mrs. Barrett retired when she was 80.         A daughter of Kate Ross and Henry Collins Brown, a founder of the Museum of the City of New York, Kay Brown was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1924, she graduated from Wellesley College, where she majored in English and was active in the dramatic society.         Her first job after graduation was as a girl Friday in the Mary Arden Theater School in Peterborough, N.H. When Joseph P. Kennedy and the school's other owners, the Guy Curriers of Boston, bought a motion-picture company, they offered her a job and put her to work reading stories to find properties. The company, called the File Booking Offices, was renamed RKO. Her first major find for the company was "Cimarron," which brought the studio an Academy Award in 1931.         Mrs. Brown's husband, James Barrett, died in 1967.         In addition to her daughter Laurinda, of Manhattan, she is survived by another daughter, Kate Barrett of Greensboro, N.C.       
         Mildred Barry Hughes, who in 1965 was the first woman elected a state senator in New Jersey, died on Jan. 11 at the Cranford (N.J.) Health and Extended Care Center. She was 92 and had lived for many years in Union, N.J.         The cause was a heart attack, said a son, Peter L. Hughes 3d of Annandale, N.J.         First elected to the New Jersey Assembly in 1957, she represented Union Township for four terms before running for the Senate in 1965. In that victory, she also was the first Democrat from Union County to be elected to the State Senate in 75 years.         After writing a handbook for the Elizabeth League of Women Voters, she was persuaded to run for the Assembly. Defeated in her first attempt in 1955, she won in 1957 and rose to become assistant majority leader in 1960 and 1961. She served one term in the Senate.         Her husband, Peter L. Hughes Jr., died in 1971. Besides her son Peter 3d, she is survived by two other sons, W. Barry of Greenwood, S.C., and David J. of Short Hills, N.J.       
         Dr. Barbara Jelavich, a prominent scholar of Eastern European history with a particular interest in the Balkan countries, died on Saturday at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 71 and lived in Bloomington.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Indiana University.         She was on the faculty of Indiana University from 1961 until she retired as distinguished professor emeritus of history in 1993. During that time, she was the author or co-author of 17 books about Russia, the Balkans, and the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires. Some were written with her husband, Charles, also a professor emeritus of history at Indiana.         Her areas of expertise included Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Yugoslavia.         Born Barbara Brightfield in Belleville, Ill., she grew up in Berkeley, Calif. She received three degrees in history from the University of California at Berkeley, including, in 1948, a Ph.D. She started her academic career at Berkeley as a junior research historian at the Institute of Slavic Studies and a lecturer in history.         She joined the Indiana faculty as a lecturer in 1961 and by 1967 was a full professor in the history department.         Among her works currently in print are "History of the Balkans: 18th and 19th Centuries" (Cambridge University Press, 1983); "History of the Balkans: 20th Century" (Cambridge, 1983); "Russia and the Formation of the Romanian Empire" (Cambridge, 1984); "Modern Austria: Empire and Republic" (Cambridge, 1987); "Russia and the Rumanian National Cause" (Archon reprint, 1974), and "Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806-1914" (Cambridge, 1991).         Besides her husband, survivors include two sons, Mark, of Maryville, Mo., and Peter, of Austin, Tex., and two grandchildren.       
         Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.         Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.         Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing.  "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.         She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.         In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.       
         Kay Aldridge Tucker, an actress and model who was one of the most photographed women in the country in the 1930's, died on Jan. 12 at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. She was 77 and lived in Camden, Me.         The cause was a heart attack, said Lester Glassner, a friend.         Ms. Tucker, whose stage name was Kay Aldridge, appeared on the covers of Life, Ladies' Home Journal, Redbook and Look magazines and in many advertisements. Her Hollywood career began when she was given a screen test for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind." The test led to her appearance in feature films and three highly successful serials, "Perils of Nyoka," "Daredevils of the West" and "Haunted Harbor." Her feature film credits include "Free, Blonde and 21," "Down Argentine Way," "You're in the Army Now" and "DuBarry Was a Lady." She retired from acting in 1945.         Ms. Tucker's third husband, Harry Nasland, died in 1988.         She is survived by a daughter, Carey Cameron Ferrero; two sons, Scott and Arthur Cameron; a stepdaughter, Minnie Tucker Biggs, and two stepsons, Richard and Samuel Tucker.       
         Pearl Wong, who with her husband, James, operated Pearl's Chinese Restaurant in mid-Manhattan, serving Cantonese fare to the famous and not-so-famous for 18 years until her retirement in 1985, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her sister, Emily Fong, also of Manhattan.         When a restaurant that the Wongs had managed for years, Canton Village, changed hands in the mid-1960's, the couple found themselves without jobs. Almost as distressing, regular customers from the nearby Time-Life Building, who had depended on Mrs. Wong as their culinary guide, faced ordering meals on their own.         The Wongs then began Pearl's Chinese Restaurant, with 52 investors buying single $500 shares, and the Wongs and a handful of other investors buying in at a higher level.         The 68-seat establishment at 149 West 48th Street quickly became a popular haunt for theatrical celebrities. Its loyalty to Cantonese cuisine, while spicier Sichuan-Hunan fare was flourishing, brought in serious diners. Craig Claiborne, the food editor of The New York Times, called it "one of the neatest and best Chinese restaurants in all New York" in 1967.         When the restaurant's quarters were razed for an office tower in 1973, it was moved to its current location at 38 West 48th Street, where the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates gave the interior a cool, sophisticated look.         In 1985, Mrs. Wong joined her husband in retirement. She is survived by her husband and sister.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         "Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities. Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives. Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please." An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities.         Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.

God has held us all in his hand."         Correction:  March 17, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Jan. 23 of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy misstated both the name and the location of the school from which she graduated in 1910. At that time, it was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart, not Manhattanville College, and it was located in Manhattanville, N.Y., not Purchase. A recent letter from a reader pointed out the error.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's church, children and grandchildren today celebrated the enduring Catholic faith of the founding mother of a political dynasty at funeral services in the church where she was baptized 104 years ago.         Her last living son, Edward M. Kennedy, eulogized the mother of a President, two Senators and an Ambassador and the grandmother of two United States Representatives and the Lieutenant Governor and a state representative in Maryland, saying, "She was ambitious not only for our success, but for our souls."         "She sustained us in the saddest times -- by her faith in God, which was the greatest gift she gave us -- and by the strength of her character, which was a combination of the sweetest gentleness and the most tempered steel," he said.         Bernard Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston, celebrated the Mass of Resurrection at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church and said, "Surely, as she herself expressed it, her greatest gift was the gift of faith."         "She treasured it beyond all others," he continued, "and we honor that gift in her as we bring her here to this church."         The Cardinal read a letter of condolence from President Clinton and an apostolic blessing from Pope John Paul II, and called Mrs. Kennedy "a woman of great strength and deep faith, who is unequaled in the way her life was at the service of the commonweal."         "Few lives," he said, "have been so intertwined with the joys and sorrows of our nation's life as have hers."         Mrs. Kennedy, whose sons John and Robert were assassinated, whose son Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in a wartime plane explosion, and whose daughter Kathleen was killed in a plane crash, was quoted by her grandson Edward M. Kennedy Jr. as saying in her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974):         "The most important element in human life is faith. If God were to take away all His blessings, health, physical fitness, wealth, intelligence and leave me with but one gift, I would ask for faith -- for with faith in Him and His Goodness, mercy and love for me, and belief in everlasting life, I believe I could suffer the loss of my other gifts and still be happy."         Along with personal friends of Mrs. Kennedy and her children, the congregation of more than 700 included Tipper Gore, the wife of the Vice President, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston and Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, all Democrats. The two most prominent Republicans were Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who has preceded Senator Kennedy in one Senate chairmanship and followed him in another, and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.         One absentee who was frequently recalled was Mrs. Kennedy's oldest living daughter, Rosemary, who resides in an institution for the mentally retarded in Wisconsin. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the next oldest, said, "Mother's intelligence was always informed and directed by the strength and compassion of the heart," exemplified when "she never forgot or let us ignore the company of our sister, Rosemary." Mrs. Shriver told of Rosemary's going with her on her first trip to Europe and of their forging a friendship that became the basis of her work for the disabled and the mentally retarded.         The grandmother's determined jaw was recognizable on many of the dozens of descendants who attended. The service was occasionally punctuated by cries from the youngest of her great-grandchildren who were here.         Mrs. Kennedy's 104 years amounted to just more than half the history of the Republic, and Senator Kennedy said she "was born in 1890, the year of the Battle of Wounded Knee, when Benjamin Harrison was in the White House."         "And she never let us forget that she had lived so much of the history that we only read about," he said.         Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald was baptized in St. Stephen's Church on July 23, 1890, just a day after her birth. She graduated from Dorchester High School and received her diploma in 1906 from her father the Mayor, John F. Fitzgerald, who was known as Honey Fitz. She was courted and wed in 1914 by an ambitious banker, Joseph P. Kennedy.         Both Senator Kennedy and Mrs. Shriver called their mother "our greatest teacher." Mrs. Shriver told of geography quizzes and bedtime stories, and said, "She taught us to listen to Dad's dinner table conversations about politics, which seemed too boring to a small child but later became the basis for our life's work."         This morning Massachusetts drivers stopped in the cold at highway overpasses to watch the motorcade bring her body from her home at Hyannis Port. This afternoon, after the church service, she was buried next to her husband, who died in 1969, in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.       
         Anne D. Campbell, an official of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 50 and had homes in Washington and Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, according to Steve Selby, a Washington business associate.         Mrs. Campbell, a longtime resident of Shrewsbury, N.J., rose to prominence in the state party in the 1970's. She was serving her fourth term on the National Committee's executive committee in Washington. She joined that panel more than 10 years ago and was the co-chairwoman of the party's rules and bylaws committee for the last several years.         Born in Brownsville, Tex., she grew up in New York City, attended Monmouth College and entered national politics in 1972. She was a past vice chairman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee and in 1977 became the first woman to be elected president of the National Association of State Chairmen. She also held senior posts on the staff of Gov.  Brendan T. Byrne of New Jersey and was an adviser to Senator Bill Bradley in his successful campaigns.         She was the political director at the Democratic National Convention in 1988, as well as director of candidate and Congressional relations at the 1992 national convention.         Mrs. Campbell was a partner in the legislative consulting firm of Campbell, Falk & Selby in Washington, which she founded in 1988.         She is survived by her husband of 30 years, George Campbell; a daughter, Heather, of Santa Fe, N.M.; and two sons, James, also of Santa Fe, and Nial, of Manhattan.       
         Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said.         Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.         She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.         Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."         When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.         The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."         Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."         Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.         In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.         Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.         Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.         Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Suzanne Storrs Pincus, a community volunteer active in social services and the arts, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 60.         She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Pincus was a director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a board member and past president of the Auxiliary of Montefiore Medical Center and a founder of the Professional Committee of Elem-Youth in Distress in Israel.         She was a director of Women in Need, a nonprofit organization that seeks to keep homeless women and their children together, and a founder of its summer camp, Camp WIN. She also was a founder of the nonprofit Bronx Community Enterprises, a Montefiore spinoff to encourage local businesses.         She was born Suzanne Storrs Poulton in Provo, Utah, and studied speech and communication at the University of Utah.         She turned to community work 27 years ago, helping to develop methods of improving child care and encouraging self-help among the disadvantaged.         Mrs. Pincus was on the boards of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., and the American Place Theater in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband, Lionel I. Pincus, chairman of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, a venture banking firm; two sons, Henry A. and Matthew S., both of Manhattan; and three brothers, Brent Poulton, of Medford, Ore., Kent Poulton, of San Francisco, and Michael Poulton, of Lausanne, Switzerland.       
         Lucy D. Manoff, for four decades a leader in cultural and educational institutions in Israel, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 81.         She died of complications of pulmonary and heart disease, said her son Robert K. Manoff of Pound Ridge, N.Y.         Among the institutions in which she held leadership posts were the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Vidal Sassoon Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism of the Hebrew University and the Committee on Manpower Opportunities in Israel. The latter group recruited American volunteer doctors to serve with the Israeli forces during the Six-Day War of 1967.         For more than 30 years, Mrs. Manoff was the American executive director for the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The institute was organized to study American historical ties to Israel and the contemporary Jewish experience worldwide.         Mrs. Manoff played a prominent role in developing curriculums for Jewish studies in American colleges and universities.         An early feminist, she was a founding member of the board of the Women's Campaign Fund, organized to promote the election of women to public office.         Mrs. Manoff was born in New York City and graduated from Hunter College.         She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Richard K. Manoff; another son, Dr. Gregory P. Manoff of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Martha Deutscher of New York, and six grandchildren.       
         Irene S. Forrest, a biochemist who helped develop tests to trace whether psychiatric patients were taking their medication, died on Dec. 22 in her home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 86.         The cause was complications from diabetes, said her daughter, Joan H. Armer of Menlo Park.         Together with her late husband, Fred M. Forrest, a psychiatrist, Dr. Forrest developed urine tests to detect drugs in the body, phenothiazines, used in the treatment of schizophrenia. The tests, called Forrest tests, also allow doctors to determine the amount of drugs taken and how they worked in the body.         Psychiatric patients are often reluctant to take drugs, doctors say, because it is a tacit admission that they are ill.         Born in Berlin, Dr. Forrest received her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where she studied under her father, Carl Neuberg, the director. From 1932 to 1936, she worked at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and at Istanbul University before emigrating to the United States.         After World War II she was reunited with her father and worked with him at New York University, the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn and the New York Medical College until his death in 1956. In 1957, she joined the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brockton, Mass., to do research in psychopharmacology.         Dr. Forrest transferred to the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1961. While there she also held research positions at either Stanford University or the University of San Francisco until her retirement in 1978.         Over her career, she had more more than 100 papers published.         In addition to her daughter, Dr. Forrest is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Blanche G. Etra, a lawyer and philanthropist who played an important role in the development of Yeshiva University, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was leukemia, said a son, Donald, of Los Angeles.         The Etra family had long supported Yeshiva. Mrs. Etra expanded that role by helping to found, in 1953, the National Women's Division of Yeshiva's newly chartered Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was its first president and became honorary president in 1962.         When the university founded the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in the mid-1970's, she was named to its Board of Directors and served as secretary from 1986 until her death. She also was the first woman to serve on the medical college's Board of Overseers.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Etra graduated from Barnard College in 1935. In 1938, she received a law degree from Columbia University and began a private practice. After the death of her husband of 38 years, Harry, in 1977, she joined the law firm of Etra & Etra, where her partner was her brother-in-law, Max Etra, chairman of Yeshiva's board from 1953 to 1977.         Mrs. Etra was on the national Board of Directors for the United Jewish Appeal and served as a director of Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa., and the Brookdale Center of Hunter College.         Besides Donald, she is survived by two other sons, Aaron and Marshall, both of Manhattan; a sister, Helen Rachmil of Los Angeles; a brother, Morton Goldman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren. A fourth son, Jonathan, died in 1991.       
         Nora Dunfee, an actress who taught for many years in the graduate acting program of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, died on Dec. 23 at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was complications after a brief illness, the university's press office reported in a statement.         Ms. Dunfee was born in Belmont, Ohio. She began her professional acting career at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Me. Her stage credits included "Madam, Will You Walk?" (1953), "The Midnight Caller" (1958), "The Visit" (1960), "The Last Days of Lincoln" (1961) and "Crowbar" (1990).         She also taught privately in New York and California and coached many actors over the years, including Julie Haydon, James Earl Jones, Raul Julia, Diane Keaton, Mel Gibson and Keanu Reeves. In theater, she was a vocal consultant for "The Real Thing," "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Lie of the Mind."         Ms. Dunfee also appeared in films, including "Lorenzo's Oil." Most recently, she was seen in "Forrest Gump," as the Southern Lady who sympathetically advises Tom Hanks at a bus stop.         Ms. Dunfee met her future husband, David Clarke, in an acting class. The couple appeared together in a number of stage productions, including "Portrait of a Lady," "The Visit" and "The Gin Game."         She is survived by her husband; two daughters, K. C. Ligon of New York City and Susan Bennett of Seattle, and two grandchildren.       
         Kathleen Tynan, a writer best known for her biography of her husband, the critic Kenneth Tynan, died yesterday at King Edward VII Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, a friend and the executor of Mrs. Tynan's estate.         Mrs. Tynan was a journalist, essayist and fiction writer whose works include the novel "The Summer Aeroplane" (1975) and the screenplay and novel titled "Agatha" (1979), a fictional speculation on the midlife disappearance of Agatha Christie.         But it was "The Life of Kenneth Tynan" (1987), an unflinching portrait of the influential English drama critic to whom she was married for 13 years, that was the high point of Mrs. Tynan's literary career. "It was such a weird thing, to write about your husband," she said at the time. "I was a passionate sleuth, torn between being the outsider and insider."         The book, however, was widely praised for its objectivity. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Benedict Nightingale described it as "almost frighteningly judicious," adding that Mrs. Tynan "somehow manages to fulfill, perhaps even surpass, the obligations of a good biographer."         The daughter of Matthew Halton, a Canadian journalist, Mrs. Tynan was reared in Canada and England and attended Oxford University. She worked as a researcher for Newsweek and as a reporter for The Observer and The Sunday Times in London. Her marriage to Mr. Tynan, her second, began in 1967 and lasted until his death, in 1980.         Mrs. Tynan was also the co-editor of "Profiles" (1990), selected essays by her husband, and the editor of "Kenneth Tynan: Letters," which came out in England last fall (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) and will be published in the United States by Random House in the spring.         She is survived by a daughter, Roxana, of Los Angeles, and a son, Matthew, of London, from her marriage to Mr. Tynan; her mother, Jean Halton of Ottawa, and a brother, David, of Washington.       
         Sylvia Bernstein Seaman, a writer and one of the last active members of the suffragist movement, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said. She published a book about that disease 30 years ago, "Always a Woman: What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer," the first by someone outside the medical profession. "It was considered daring at the time," she later said, "but it changed attitudes, I think."         She became a confirmed suffragist in high school and first marched for the right to vote as a student in 1915. While in college, she took part in the parades of August 1920 celebrating the 19th Amendment that secured women's suffrage nationwide.         In 1970, she was one of five veterans of 1920 chosen to lead the 50th anniversary parade on Fifth Avenue.         She was in the lead again in a 1980 march marking the 60th anniversary of victory. She made her final public appearance last August with an address on feminism and women in American history when the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women marked the 74th anniversary.         Sylvia Bernstein was born in Manhattan and graduated from Cornell University. She taught high school English in New York City before turning to writing.         With her Cornell roommate, Frances Schwartz, she wrote novels under the name Francis Sylvin. They chose a male pseudonym because they thought that female authors were not taken seriously.         In one novel, "Miracle Father" (1952), a couple produced a child by artificial insemination. It was republished in 1968 as "Test-Tube Father."         Mrs. Seaman underwent a radical mastectomy in 1955, an experience that led her to write "Always a Woman," published in 1965. It was a rarely discussed topic, which she also wrote about for magazines and newspapers.         In the 1970's, she resumed writing travel pieces and humor, including her last book, "How to Be a Jewish Grandmother" (1979). Travel was her avocation, and she visited more than 100 countries.         Her personal and professional papers are in the collection of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe College.         She is survived by her husband of 69 years, William Seaman; two sons, Gideon, of Manhattan and Jonathan, of Brooklyn, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Aylin Radomisli-Cates, a psychiatrist who was the wife of the producer Joseph Cates, died on Jan. 17 in a car accident outside her home in Bedford Hills, N.Y. She was 57.         After graduating from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, she became an assistant clinical professor at Cornell University Medical College. She entered the Army in 1992 as a lieutenant colonel to head the psychiatric service at Fort Sill, Okla. After two years in the Army, she returned to private practice, opening offices in Bedford Hills and Manhattan.         She was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and served for many years as a trustee of Roberts College, an English-language university there.         In 1987, she married Mr. Cates, a producer of Broadway shows and television programs. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Nilufer Gulek, of Ankara, Turkey.       
         Helen Phillips Hayter, an American sculptor, died on Jan. 23 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 81 and also had a home in Paris.         Mrs. Hayter was born in Fresno, Calif., in 1913. After studies at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, she went to Paris on a scholarship in 1936. There she studied engraving at Atelier 17, the printmaking workshop of the painter and engraver Stanley William Hayter. They were married in 1940.         In her sculpture, Mrs. Hayter worked mostly in polished bronze, developing an idiom of semi-abstract figuration influenced by Brancusi, the Surrealists and Pre-Columbian statuary.         During World War II the Hayters lived in New York, where Mr. Hayter published prints by Abstract Expressionists. Mrs. Hayter had her first solo show in 1942 at the New School for Social Research and the first of several joint exhibitions with her husband at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1949. The Hayters returned to Paris in 1950; they were divorced in 1970.         Mrs. Hayter is represented in several collections, among them the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.         She is survived by two sons, Augy, of Manhattan, and Julian, of Paris; a sister, Marian Britton of Sonoma, Calif., and two grandsons.       
         Laura Scott Taylor, the co-founder and retired principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, died on Sunday at Kings County Hospital Center. Mrs. Taylor, who lived in Crown Heights, was 79.         Mrs. Taylor was fatally injured when she was hit by a truck last Friday while crossing a street in Crown Heights.         For 32 years, Mrs. Taylor served as the unsalaried principal of the Concord Baptist Elementary School, which she established in 1960 with her husband, the Rev. Gardner Taylor, now pastor emeritus of the Concord Baptist Church of Christ.         Dr. Taylor, who had been a member of the New York City Board of Education, said the school was founded because many parents felt their children were being "intellectually butchered" by the public school system. "The kids were finished before their lives had started," he said.         The school emphasizes reading and extensive instruction in black history and culture. "It means a great deal to know Negroes are making a success in every phase of life," Mrs. Taylor said in 1967. "For these children to get a good opinion of themselves is very important. They should know that those who want to make it can."         Begun with 25 pupils in grades one through six, the school reached an enrollment of 130 pupils in seven years.         "We have proved that Negroes can learn to do what anybody else can do," Mrs. Taylor said then. "There is something radically wrong with the public school system if our kids can't read."         Today, the school has an enrollment of 150 in its six grades.         Mrs. Taylor, who was born in Cleveland, grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and graduated in 1937 from Oberlin College. In 1940, after teaching in South Carolina, she married Dr. Taylor, whom she had met at the Mount Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin while he was a student at the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology.         The Taylors moved to New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La., and came to Brooklyn in 1948, when Dr. Taylor was named pastor of the Concord Baptist Church. He retired in 1990 as the dean of black pastors in the United States. In 1952, when the church was destroyed by fire, Mrs. Taylor led its women in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for the construction of a replacement.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Taylor is survived by her daughter, Martha LaCroix; a brother, Eugene Scott; a sister, Elizabeth Taylor; a sister by adoption, Ruby Harris, and a grandson.       
         Millicent Hirsh Lang, a Bronx native who became a top-ranked women's tennis player in the 1930's and 1940's, died at a hospice in Boca Raton, Fla., on Friday. She was 78 and lived most of her life in Great Neck, L.I.         She died of a stroke, said her husband, Nathaniel Lang.         Mrs. Lang began playing tennis when she was 8 years old on public courts in the Bronx. She won her first public tournament at age 11. As a junior player, she captured three titles in the 1930's and at age 16 won the singles and doubles trophies at the United States Ladies Tennis Association National Indoors Tournament in 1933.         By the time she was 19, Mrs. Lang was a veteran on the women's tennis circuit. In the early 1940's, she was ranked 14th in United States women's singles and No. 1 in the Eastern states. In her later years, she played a prominent role in the Eastern Tennis Association.         She is survived by her husband; her daughters, Geraldine Jacobs of Woodstock, N.Y., Sarah Cleary of Warwick, N.Y., and Elizabeth Marino of Great Neck, and seven grandchildren.       
         Janina Domanska, an author and illustrator of children's books, died on Feb. 2 at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 82 and lived in New Fairfield, Conn.         She had suffered a stroke recently, said her stepson Robert Nossen.         Ms. Domanska was born in Warsaw and studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. She came to the United States in 1952 and worked in New York City as a textile designer and freelance artist before turning to creating picture books for children.         She wrote, adapted or translated 22 books, each accompanied by her own illustrations, which frequently evoked Polish folk art and drew upon folk tales from her childhood. She also illustrated 23 books by other authors. Among her best-known books are "If All the Seas Were One" (1971), "King Krakus and the Dragon" (1979), "Busy Monday Morning" (1985) and "A Was an Angler" (1991).         In addition to her stepson Robert, of Naples, she is survived by her husband, Ernest Nossen; another stepson, Edward Nossen of Cherry Hill, N.J., and five stepgrandchildren.       
         Ruth Charlton Mitchell Masson, a philanthropist who made large contributions to the Mayo Clinic and to a hospital in her birthplace of Fall River, Mass., died on Feb. 11 at her home in Rochester, Minn. She was 104.         The cause of death was pneumonia, an official at the Waring Funeral Home in Fall River said.         Mrs. Masson was a daughter of Earle Perry Charlton, a pioneer in retailing who became one of the five founders of F. W. Woolworth after his 54 stores, E.P. Charlton & Co., were merged with Woolworth in 1912.         Mrs. Masson attended Chevy Chase College in Washington and married Frederick M. Mitchell, who owned wholesale leather businesses, Mitchell & Pierson Manufacturing and Mitchell & Fletcher Company in Philadelphia. Mrs. Masson and her husband actively supported the former Truesdale Hospital, now the Charlton Memorial Hospital, in Fall River.         Mr. Mitchell died in 1960. Mrs. Masson later married Dr. James C. Masson, a surgeon at the Mayo Clinic.         After his death in 1975, she contributed to the Mayo Clinic in honor of her father and her first and second husbands, establishing a James C. Masson Professorship in Surgery. In 1985, the Ruth and Frederick Mitchell Student Center of the Mayo Medical School was dedicated. The Charlton Building, a 200,000-square-foot addition to the Mayo Clinic, was dedicated in her family's honor on Mrs. Masson's 98th birthday in 1989.         She remained active throughout her life in the Charlton Memorial Hospital, both as a contributor and as a board member. In 1992, the Ruth Charlton Mitchell Therapy Center at the hospital was dedicated in her honor.         She is survived by two nephews, Earle P. Charlton 2d of Hillsborough, Calif., and Henry C. Lincoln of Swansea, Mass., and a niece, Thelma West of Ione, Calif.       
         Dr. Mary Dwight B. McNair Scott, a biochemistry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was a pioneer in the identification of the B complex of vitamins and their functions, died on Feb. 9 at the Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, where she lived. She was 87.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Thomas F. McNair Scott.         In 1935, while she was completing work at Harvard University for a doctorate in biochemistry, she became one of the first women appointed to the faculty of the Harvard Medical School as a research associate.         She married the following year and moved to England with her husband where she did research on the biochemistry of diabetes at the University College Medical School in London.         From 1943 to 1946, while on the faculty of Wellesley College, she conducted studies identifying N-methyl nicotinamide in urine which contributed to the discovery of the B complex vitamin, niacin.         After her husband completed his wartime service in England, the couple settled in Philadelphia, where she went to work for the University of Pennsylvania's Children's Hospital. From 1954 to 1965 she was in the School of Medicine's research medicine and physiology departments. In 1965 Dr. Scott moved to the School of Veterinary Medicine and retired in 1972.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Robert, of Bern, Switzerland; a daughter, Carolyn Hoehn of Heidelberg, Germany; a sister, Helen Sutton Gulick of Sacramento, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Ada Lublin Goldberg, for many years an advocate for the poor and homeless on Long Island, died Sunday at Hospice-by-the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. A resident of North Bellmore, L.I., she was 67.         The cause was renal failure stemming from kidney cancer, said her son, Lawrence A. Goldberg.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Goldberg became active in the League of Women Voters 40 years ago when she joined its Nassau County chapter. At her death, she was the chapter's director of social policy.         In conjunction with her work for the league, she served on the board of the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, a coalition of social-welfare agencies and service organizations serving the poor. She received the council's Community Service Award last year.         She also served on the executive board of the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for a National Health Care Plan. In addition, she was active in the Child Care Council of Nassau County and the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless.         Besides her son, a resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by her husband, Stanley; a daughter, Helene of New Haven; two brothers, Howard Lublin of Manhattan and Seldon Lublin of Newburgh, N.Y., and a granddaughter.

         Dr. Gily Epstein Bard-Staroben, a plant scientist at the City University of New York for some 30 years, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. A longtime resident of Tuckahoe, N.Y., she was 70.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Dr. Bard specialized in plant succession, the natural changes in the vegetation of a site over time. She was an expert on secondary succession of woodlands, about which she wrote several papers.         She was born in Berlin and came as a child to the United States with her parents. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in soil science from Cornell University and a doctorate in plant physiology from Rutgers University. She started teaching at Hunter in the 1950's and was also on the faculties of Lehman College and the CUNY Graduate Center.         Dr. Bard directed a doctoral program in plant sciences offered by the Graduate Center and the New York Botanical Garden. She retired from teaching about five years ago.         She was a past editor of the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, a botanical journal. She was a trustee of the Mianus River Gorge Reservation in Connecticut, and helped in the 1950's to save from development Mettler's Woods in New Brunswick, N.J., now the William L. Hutcheson Memorial Forest.         Dr. Bard is survived by her second husband, Irving Staroben of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Doron D. Bard of Gaithersburg; a sister, Nurie Relis of Manhattan, and a grandson. Her first husband, Seldon Bard, and a son, Etan R., died in a 1974 terrorist bombing of a Rome-bound T.W.A. airliner over the Agean Sea.       
         Ellen Sulzberger Straus, who was active in Call for Action and other nonprofit organizations and in the communications industry, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, R. Peter Straus.         At her death, Mrs. Straus was president of Executive Service Strategies, a management and consulting firm that she founded in 1986. She and Mr. Straus were for some years co-owners of WMCA, a Manhattan-based radio station, which they sold in 1986.         In 1963, Mrs. Straus founded Call for Action, the nation's first telephone help line, which was intended to aid individuals in solving their problems with officials, corporations and landlords. That activity, using office space at WMCA, became the prototype for similar organizations in nearly all major United States cities.         Mrs. Straus was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College in 1945. She worked as the executive secretary of the New York League of Women Voters and on the staff of the Atomic Energy Commission, becoming assistant director of public information. In 1949, she helped to manage Gov. Herbert H. Lehman's campaign for the United States Senate.         Later, based in Switzerland while Mr. Straus was an executive with the International Labor Organization, she worked as a Geneva correspondent for several upstate newspapers.         In addition to her husband of 45 years, who is chairman of Straus Communications, Mrs. Straus is survived by her mother, Louise Mayer Blumenthal Sulzberger of Longboat Key, Fla., and Saranac Lake, N.Y.; four children, Diane Tucker of Bedford, N.Y., Katherine Caple of Wellesley, Mass., Jeanne Tofel of Manhattan and Eric Straus of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; two sisters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann Sand, both of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Ida Gertrude Krebs, whose lifelong interest in children with learning disabilities led her to found a school where she could implement a highly individual approach to such problems, died on Feb. 11 at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. She was 86 and had lived in Lexington, Mass., until about three years ago.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Roy R. Krebs Jr. of Alexandria.         Born in Fort Worth, a grand-niece of President Woodrow Wilson, she first offered help to the disadvantaged when, as a teen-ager, she tutored a neighbor who had been dismissed from school because of a learning disability. In 1968, she founded the Krebs School in Lexington, Mass., where more than 100 children with learning disabilities studied in classes of no more than eight pupils.         She employed unusual techniques to capture the children's interest. The school's pet dog was brought to class so students would learn to count by monitoring the wags of its tail. Division was taught with visits to the kitchen to slice carrots.         She was a member of the President's Council on Handicapped Children for more than 20 years and worked as a consultant to Governments in Canada, Colombia and Venezuela.         Trained as a nurse, she counseled veterans returning from World War II who had suffered battle trauma. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education from Boston University, she tutored extensively in Cambridge, Mass., and then in Arlington, Mass., before establishing her own school.         Upon her retirement in 1986, the Krebs School was merged into the Cotting School, which offered a more comprehensive curriculum.         Her husband, Roy R. Krebs, died in the mid-1940's. In addition to her son, Roy Jr., she is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Quinlan of San Clemente, Calif., and Dr. Ruth Briles of Sycamore, Ill.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Evelyn Tripp, a leading fashion model of the 1950's and 1960's, died on Monday in her home at Remsenburg, L.I. She was 67.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Stan Young.         Ms. Tripp was widely considered to be among the most versatile of a small group of models that exemplified the postwar American fashion industry's emphasis on glamour. Her dramatic features -- a high round forehead, prominent chin and broad cheekbones -- were recorded by dozens of noted photographers, among them, Horst P. Horst, Richard Avedon, Irwin Blumenfeld, Karen Radkai and Lillian Bassman.         Ms. Tripp was a favorite subject of William Klein. His 1958 photograph of her, blowing cigarette smoke from beneath the veil of a beaded cocktail hat, appears on the cover of "William Klein: In and Out of Fashion" (Random House, 1994). It also serves as the signature image of an exhibition of the photographer's work that is currently at the International Center of Photography.         The daughter of a lead miner, Evelyn Tripp was born in 1927 on a small farm in Flat River, Mo. After being discovered at age 20 -- a clerical worker, she was shopping at a Fifth Avenue department store when spotted by an assistant to Louise Dahl-Wolfe, the celebrated Harper's Bazaar photographer -- Ms. Tripp soon began to appear frequently on magazine covers.         She appeared on more than 40 covers, beginning with the Jan. 1, 1949, issue of Vogue. She retired in 1968.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Sadie Tripp; a brother, David Tripp, both of Farmington, Mo., and two sisters, Kay Taylor of Dahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Karen Eaton of Topeka, Kan.       
         Adele Green, a co-founder of the Lawrence of London raincoat company, died on Friday at Bronx Lebanon Hospital after a brief illness. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan.         As the designer for Lawrence of London, which she founded with her first husband, Norman Lawrence, in the 1950's, Mrs. Green helped to bring rainwear into the fashion spectrum by offering water-repellent coats that could also be worn on sunny days and as evening wraps. At one time, she enlisted Valentino, the Italian couturier, to design a special collection for the company.         Mrs. Green was born in Boston and graduated from Wellesley College. She also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.         She left Lawrence of London in the late 1970's after being divorced from Mr. Lawrence. She then married Arthur Green, who died 10 years ago, and worked as a consultant to the rainwear industry.         Mrs. Green is survived by her daughter, Rochel Klein of Brooklyn; two sisters, Jacqueline Lowenthal and Allene Warzer, both of Freeport, N.Y., and six nieces and nephews.       
         Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnomusicologist, writer and the widow of the composer Henry Cowell, died on Thursday at her home in Shady, N.Y., said Sean Hartnett, her executor. She was 92.         In her extensive travels from 1937 to 1957, Mrs. Cowell recorded American, Finnish, Irish, Portuguese, Iranian and Turkish folk music, among other types. Her collection, housed in the Library of Congress, is among the most extensive ever gathered and includes some of the earliest documentation of ethnic music in the United States. It holds not only field recordings, but also correspondence, field notes, photographs, articles and other materials.         She was born in San Francisco in 1903 and received a bachelor of arts in philology and Romance languages from Stanford University in 1924. After graduating, she studied piano in Paris with the pianist and teacher Alfred Cortot.         In 1935-36, she directed the social music program at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. The next year, she worked for the Resettlement Administration (renamed the Farm Security Administration) in Appalachia and the Ozarks, recording black American music in chain-gang road camps.         She met Cowell in 1927 as his piano student. They were married in 1941 and together they traveled as cultural ambassadors for the State Department, collecting music from around the world. After his death in 1965, she became one of the biggest champions of his music.         Mrs. Cowell was also a teacher and writer. She taught courses in American folk music at the University of Southern California, and was an author, with her husband, of "Charles Ives and His Music" (1955).         No immediate family members survive.       
         Doris Carson, who sang and danced in a number of Broadway musicals, died on Feb. 20 at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 83.         Doris Carson Weisbard began her stage career at 17 when, as understudy for Ruby Keeler in the George and Ira Gershwin musical "Show Girl," she substituted for the star for two highly successful weeks. Her performance led to roles in shows including "Strike Up the Band" (1930), "The Cat and the Fiddle" (1931) and "On Your Toes" (1936), in which she appeared opposite Ray Bolger. She also performed in London, where she appeared on the West End in Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," among other shows.         She is survived by her husband, Leonard, and a sister, Janis Ogelvie.       
         Bella Fishko, an art dealer and founder of the Forum Gallery, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, Robert, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Fishko, whose original name was Bella Gold, was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1913 and moved to the United States with her parents in 1923. She attended Hunter College and in the early 1940's began working at the A.C.A. Gallery. After leaving A.C.A. in the late 1950's, she established the Forum Gallery, specializing in American figurative art. The artists represented by the gallery, now at 745 Fifth Avenue, include Raphael Soyer, Chaim Gross, David Levine and Gregory Gillespie. Mrs. Fishko retired in 1988 and was succeeded by her son.         Mrs. Fishko's husband, Sol, died in 1989. In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Sara Gill, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.       
         Loyce Houlton, a leader in American regional dance and a choreographer whose works were performed by companies in the United States and Europe, died on Tuesday at United Hospital in St. Paul. She was 70 and lived in Minneapolis.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Lise Houlton Gilliland, a former member of American Ballet Theater and the Stuttgart Ballet.         Mrs. Houlton favored a rhapsodic choreographic style that combined ballet with various modern-dance techniques. She created more than 90 works, many of them to contemporary music, and her Minnesota Dance Theater became known for its experimental productions. Ballets by her have also been presented by Dance Theater of Harlem, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Deutsche Oper Ballet of Berlin.         A tiny and perpetually restless woman, Mrs. Houlton liked to say to students: "Explode! Be voracious in space." Yet for the last two decades of her life, she was in chronic ill health. Undaunted, she once said in an interview that her illness had significantly changed her choreography. "I have more courage now," she declared.         Mrs. Houlton, a native of Duluth, Minn., studied dance at Carleton College and New York University and at several New York ballet and modern-dance schools. After settling in Minneapolis, she founded the Contemporary Dance Playhouse in 1962; seven years later, it was renamed Minnesota Dance Theater. Financial problems in 1986 forced the company to disband. But in the last few years, Mrs. Houlton had attempted to reorganize it, and last summer, it revived two of her important works: her version of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and "Ancient Air," to music by George Crumb, an American composer she particularly admired.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Dr. William Houlton; three sons, Laif, Joel and Andrew, and four grandchildren, all of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Jewell Kraemer of Wausau, Wis., and Ardeth Becher of St. Paul.       
         Beverly Reitz, an interior designer known for her innovative use of light, died on Sunday in Hightstown, N.J., where she had lived since 1990.         She was 94 and had been a resident of Manhattan for much of her life. She also had a home in Ridgefield, Conn.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Clint Wade of Manhattan, a longtime friend.         Mrs. Reitz worked mainly with residences, using light to create moods. But she also designed the Women's Faculty Lounge at Columbia University and helped in redesigning the Swiss Embassy in Washington.         She was twice president of the Decorators Club of New York.         Her husband, Harold A. Reitz, died in 1976. She is survived by a sister, Amy Nell Hayes, also of Hightstown.       
         Myra Pollack Sadker, a Washington educator and writer who charted sexual bias in the nation's classrooms, died on Saturday at Georgetown Medical Center. She was 52 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was complications from a bone marrow transplant for breast cancer, said a spokesman for American University, where she was a professor and former dean of the school of education.         Dr. Sadker's most recent work was "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" (Scribners, 1994). It was written in collaboration with her husband, David M. Sadker, a fellow professor at American's school of education. The couple had first studied the subject of sexual bias when they were graduate students together.         With a decade's worth of research, "Failing at Fairness" sought to document that girls' educations were inferior to those of boys. The reason, the authors concluded, was the conscious or subconscious sexism of teachers who spend more time interacting with boys.         Teachers, according to the book, call on boys more, make more substantive comments on their work, and praise and goad them more. The result is that over time girls tend to lose self-esteem and do more poorly in standardized tests.         Dr. Sadker's research was widely reported in newspapers and magazines around the country. It also led to many invitations for her to appear on national television and radio programs.         Myra Pollack Sadker was born in Portland, Me., and graduated from Boston University. She received a master's degree at Harvard University and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. She taught at junior and senior high schools in Massachusetts and Thailand before joining the faculty of American University in 1973.         In graduate school, the Sadkers noticed that there seemed to be subtle differences in the education they received in the same classrooms and studying the same books. The experience started them in their career as a husband-and-wife team examining sexual bias in schools through research based on transcripts of classroom interactions, textbooks, surveys and polls.         Dr. Sadker was the author or co-author of six books and scores of articles on sexism, teacher education and children's books. Her work was recognized this year with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the American Association of University Women.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Sadker is survived by two daughters, Robin and Jacqueline; a brother, Dr. Murray Pollack of Potomac, Md., and her father, Louis Pollack of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Ruth Melville Berlin, a Connecticut philanthropist, died on March 15 at her home in Southport, Conn. She was 74.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Her interests extended to the environment, education, history, the arts and the homeless. She was a past or current officer of the Museums of Stony Brook, the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the Environmental Defense Fund and the Trust for Public Land of San Francisco, among others.         She also worked for a number of cultural and social welfare groups, including Operation Hope, the New York Philharmonic Society and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies of New York.         She was born in Brooklyn and attended Smith College.         Her husband, F. Henry Berlin Jr., died in 1976.         Mrs. Berlin is survived by two sons, Bruce B., of Southport, and Carswell R., of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret M. Berlin of Manhattan; a sister, Margaret M. Blackwell of Setauket, L.I.; two brothers, Frank Melville of Norfolk, Conn., and David Melville of Ringe, N.H., and a granddaughter.       
         Berenice Bramson, a soprano who received critical acclaim throughout her career, died on Thursday at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bramson was a native of Omaha. She studied at the Juilliard School of Music and Columbia University before making her solo debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1953. In a review for The New York Times, Ross Parmenter wrote that Ms. Bramson had provided "an absorbing evening of music" and that she "sang with distinction."         Twenty years later, after another recital, Peter G. Davis wrote in The Times: "Very rarely does an unheralded singer stand comparison with international superstars. Berenice Bramson can match talents with any soprano recitalist before the public today."         Ms. Bramson made her operatic debut in 1976 as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's "Queens of Spades" with the Vancouver Opera Company. She also appeared with the New York Grand Opera and the Brooklyn Opera Company. For more than 40 years, she taught voice at her studio in Katonah and several colleges. She gave her last solo recital in New York at Weill Recital Hall in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Alan; a daughter, Bobbe Dodge of Ossining, N.Y.; a son, Steven of Los Angeles, and two sisters, Belle Lipsett of Kensington, Calif., and Pearl Jacobson of Davis, Calif.       
         Maude B. Feld, a retired Manhattan antiques dealer and expert on early American glassware, died on March 13 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         She advised collectors, dealers and museums, and researched the history of the reproduction of antique glassware in Italy. She also helped to assemble collections of Wedgwood pottery and American art glass that later were donated to the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Born in Passaic, N.J., she opened a shop in New Jersey in the mid-1930's and moved it to Madison Avenue in 1959. She retired about 15 years ago.         Mrs. Feld is survived by her husband of 70 years, Samuel B.; two sons, Dr. Alan, of Las Vegas, and Stuart P., of Manhattan, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Margery Mastbaum Solomon, one of America's leading bridge players, died on Saturday at her home in Elkins Park, Pa. She was 86.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said her daughter Norma Brunswick of Rydal, Pa.         Mrs. Solomon, who was always known as Peggy, represented the United States in several international bridge competitions. In 1972, she was a member of the American team that finished third in the World Team Olympiad.         Her most important success was a victory in the National Board-a-Match Teams, now called the Reisinger Teams, in 1944. She won nine other national titles in the Mixed Teams in 1949, 1950 and 1959; the Women's Teams in 1948, 1953, 1954, 1961 and 1967, and the Women's Pairs in 1960. Her 14 second-place results included all three major national team championships, the Spingold Knockout in 1944, the Board-a-Match in 1953 and the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1954. In 1944 she became the 33d person, and only the third woman, to reach the rank of life master.         Mrs. Solomon was a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Her father, Jules Mastbaum, a real estate investor who owned a chain of movie theaters, bought many Rodin sculptures in France and built a museum to house them. The Rodin Museum was presented to the City of Philadelphia and opened in 1927 shortly after his death.         Her second husband, Charles Solomon, a former president of the American Contract Bridge League and the World Bridge Federation, died in 1975. She was previously married to Benjamin Golder, a Pennsylvania member of the House of Representatives for 12 years who also headed the national bridge organization; Mr. Golder died in 1946.         In addition to Mrs. Brunswick, Mrs. Solomon is survived by a sister, Lisa Dickson of Beverly Hills, Calif.; another daughter, Joan Ash of Elkins Park; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Muriel Resnik, a novelist and playwright best known for her comedy "Any Wednesday," died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 and had recently lived in Beaufort, N.C.         The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her husband, Victor Jackson.         "Any Wednesday," which starred Sandy Dennis, Don Porter, Gene Hackman and Rosemary Murphy, opened on Broadway in 1964 to rave reviews. The instant success of the play, Ms. Resnik's first, took even the author by surprise. In an interview, she said, "I was just praying it wouldn't be a complete bomb." It was later made into a movie starring Jane Fonda and Jason Robards.         Ms. Resnik was born in New Haven. She wrote several novels, including "Life Without Father," "House Happy" and "The Girl in the Turquoise Bikini." She later wrote "Son of Any Wednesday," a reflection on the production of the play. In 1992, her first murder mystery, "The Garden Club," was published, and at her death she was nearing completion of a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Michael, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Henry, of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Lillian Stamler of Stony Creek, Conn., and Jean Krosner of New York City; three grandchildren, and a great-grandson.       
         Norma Fields Furst, the president of Baltimore Hebrew University for the last three years, died on March 7 at her home in Wynnewood, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She was associated with Temple University from 1963 to 1983 in various positions, including full professor and finally dean of student affairs. She then was president of Harcum Junior College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., before joining Baltimore Hebrew in 1992.         She was active in many national and local organizations, including International B'nai B'rith/Hillel Commission, the Jewish Publication Society, and the American Association of University Women.         A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Furst was a graduate of Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in education and a doctorate in educational psychology at Temple.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. M. Lawrence Furst; a son, Merrick, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Laura F. Jacobs of Merion, Pa.; her mother, Anne Platzer of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.       
         Madeleine Herling, a businesswoman and philanthropist, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 75. Besides her home in Manhattan, she had residences in Miami Beach, Zurich and Sao Paolo, Brazil.         The cause was complications from leukemia, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Herling was owner and president of the Jolie Gabor Jewelry Store in Manhattan. Along with her husband, Erwin, she established the Countess Madeleine Galleries Ltd. in Manhattan. The galleries featured the works of Eastern European artists.         Active in many charitable causes, she aided the Magdalena Home for the Elderly in her native Budapest, the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem and the Emanuel Foundation in Manhattan. She was a major contributor to the building of Holocaust museums in Washington and Budapest.         Besides her husband of 48 years, she is survived by her son, Thomas, of Huntington, L.I.; a brother, Laszlo Steingisser of Chile, and four grandchildren.       
         Ludmilla B. Turkevich, an expert in Russian language and literature who was the first woman to teach at Princeton and then spent 18 years as chairwoman of the Russian department at Douglass College of Rutgers University, died on Friday at the Princeton Medical Center. She was 85 and lived at the Monroe retirement village in Jamesburg, N.J.         Her family said the cause of death was respiratory failure.         She had the academic credentials, including degrees from New York University and Bryn Mawr and a doctorate from Columbia. She had been speaking and reading Russian with an informed passion since she was a child and had added Spanish as a sub-specialty. And she had experience as a teacher at the University of Kansas and at Douglass College, in New Brunswick, N.J.         Yet if there had not been a war on in 1944, and if Princeton had not found itself without a single Russian teacher at a time when there was a sudden, almost panicky upsurge in interest in the Soviet Union, it is doubtful that the university would have allowed the former Ludmilla Buketoff of New Britain, Conn., to be more than a faculty wife, the bride of John Turkevich, a professor of chemistry.         Even after Princeton did allow her on the faculty in 1944, the university, which would wait a quarter-century more before admitting women as students, insisted on maintaining a certain distinction. During the 17 years Mrs. Turkevich taught Russian and Spanish literature and a popular course on the modern European novel, she was relegated to the position of lecturer, subject to annual contract renewals.         When Rutgers offered in 1961 to make her a full professor at Douglass, its women's division, she accepted, and spent the next 18 years dazzling students like her own daughter, Tamar Skvir, who recalled her mother yesterday as a mesmerizing lecturer who made Pushkin, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy come alive.         Professor Turkevich, who also held research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study and the Center for Theological Inquiry at Princeton and served as the president of the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and Eastern European Languages, wrote widely on Russian literature.         Her books include "Cervantes in Russia" (1950), "Masterpieces in Russian Literature" (1964) and "Spanish Literature in Russia and the Soviet Union 1735-1964" (1967).         She and her husband were also instrumental in the translation and publication of the "Guide to Russian Scientific Literature" in the 1940's and wrote the textbook "Russian for the Scientist" (1959).         Professor Turkevich also served as a specialist in American education at the United States exhibit in Moscow in 1959.         In addition to her husband and her daughter Tamar, she is survived by another daughter, Marina Naumann of Norwich, Vt., and four grandchildren.       
         Pauline Ames Plimpton, who had a late-blooming career as a writer that startled but not did not surprise her famous literary offspring, George Plimpton, died yesterday at her home in New York City. She was 93.         Her family said the cause was circulatory illness.         As the daughter, wife and mother of famous men, Mrs. Plimpton spent most of her life in the shadow of her father, Oakes Ames, the Harvard botanist; her husband, Francis T. P. Plimpton, the lawyer and diplomat, who died in 1983, and her son, George, the multifaceted editor of The Paris Review.         But at the age of 79, as her son put it yesterday, "she suddenly came out from underneath," and started writing books, concentrating, appropriately enough for a novice writer, on what she knew best: her family.         Among the eight books she turned out over the next dozen years was one about her father: "Oakes Ames, Jottings of a Harvard Botanist," (Botanical Museum of Harvard, 1979); one about her husband: "The Plimpton Papers, Law and Diplomacy" (University Press of America, 1985) and even one about her father-in-law, a wide-ranging literary collector: "A Collector's Recollections, George Arthur Plimpton" (Columbia University Library, 1992).         Mr. Plimpton said he had not been surprised at his mother's literary emergence.         "As a young girl," he said, "she kept wonderful diaries."         Mrs. Plimpton, a graduate of Smith College, also served on the boards of Planned Parenthood, the Institute for World Affairs and the Public Education Association.         In addition to George, she is survived by two other sons, Francis T. P. Plimpton Jr. of Ormond Beach, Fla. and Oakes A. Plimpton of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Plimpton of New York; a brother, Amyas Ames of Syosset, L.I., seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren.       
         Pauline Ames Plimpton, who had a late-blooming career as a writer that startled but not did not surprise her famous literary offspring, George Plimpton, died on Saturday at her home in New York City. She was 93.         Her family said the cause was circulatory illness.         As the daughter, wife and mother of famous men, Mrs. Plimpton spent most of her life in the shadow of her father, Oakes Ames, the Harvard botanist; her husband, Francis T. P. Plimpton, the lawyer and diplomat, who died in 1983, and her son, George, the multifaceted editor of The Paris Review.         But at age 79, as her son put it on Saturday, "she suddenly came out from underneath" and started writing books, concentrating, appropriately enough for a novice writer, on what she knew best: her family.         Among the eight books she turned out over the next dozen years was one about her father: "Oakes Ames, Jottings of a Harvard Botanist," (Botanical Museum of Harvard, 1979); one about her husband: "The Plimpton Papers, Law and Diplomacy" (University Press of America, 1985), and even one about her father-in-law, a wide-ranging literary collector: "A Collector's Recollections, George Arthur Plimpton" (Columbia University Library, 1992).         Mr. Plimpton said he had not been surprised at his mother's literary emergence.         "As a young girl," he said, "she kept wonderful diaries."         Mrs. Plimpton, a graduate of Smith College, was also on the boards of Planned Parenthood, the Institute for World Affairs and the Public Education Association.         In addition to George, she is survived by two other sons, Francis T. P. Plimpton Jr. of Ormond Beach, Fla., and Oakes A. Plimpton of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Plimpton of New York; a brother, Amyas Ames of Syosset, L.I., seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Bernice Levy Rudnick, a philanthropist active with organizations in New York City and in Palm Beach, Fla., died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 and also lived in Palm Beach.         The cause was cancer, according to a spokeswoman for Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Yeshiva University, which her family had long supported.         She and her husband, Cecil N. Rudnick, financed laboratories for research on Alzheimer's disease at the medical school and a meditation chapel at the college's Jack D. Weiler Hospital in the Bronx. At her death, she was vice chairman of the board at Albert Einstein.         Mrs. Rudnick was born in Manhattan and graduated from Wellesley College, where she remained active in alumni programs.         In addition to her husband of 57 years, Mrs. Rudnick is survived by two sons, David, of Palm Beach, and Andrew, of Buffalo, and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Bingham, the matriarch of the Bingham newspaper empire, died suddenly in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday evening. She was 90 and lived in Glenview, 15 minutes outside Louisville, on the family estate.         Mrs. Bingham, a philanthropist and civic leader and the widow of Barry Bingham Sr., was delivering a speech at a dinner in her honor when she collapsed. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Norton Hospital.         At the dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel to raise money for the de Paul School in Louisville, Mrs. Bingham had been toasted by Gov. Brereton Jones; Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville; other Kentucky dignitaries, and her daughter Eleanor Bingham Miller.         Before delivering her prepared speech, Mrs. Bingham said she was so flattered by the event that "the best thing would be for a big pink cloud to come down and take me away." She then spoke about the need for civic responsibility and asked for support of the Louisville Free Public Library.         In the part of her talk that remained undelivered, she quoted Pericles as saying that an Athenian "who did not acquaint himself with and took no part in public affairs was regarded not as unambitious, but as a man of no consequence whatever."         All her life, she was a most enthusiastic participant in public and cultural affairs. Governor Jones said that with Mrs. Bingham's death, "Kentucky has lost one of its most caring and productive citizens."         A distinguished, articulate woman, Mrs. Bingham was for more than 60 years a major presence on the Louisville scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bingham, always known as "the Binghams," were great hosts, especially at Kentucky Derby time, when their invitations were among the most coveted.         Together with Mr. Bingham, who died in 1988, Mrs. Bingham was a generous supporter of the arts and of educational and social programs. She was a strong environmentalist and also led a drive to send book mobiles to rural Kentucky.         After her husband died, she took over as the head of the family foundation, the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, which gave $59 million to a wide variety of institutions. Last fall, the Actors Theater of Louisville opened the Bingham Theater. The beneficence of the Binghams is one reason Louisville is such a prosperous cultural community.         In 1986, a bitter family conflict engulfed the Binghams, leading to the sale of their media empire, the cornerstone of which was The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper known for its liberal politics and socially conscious positions. Barry Bingham Sr. had been publisher of the newspaper after his father, Robert Bingham, and, in turn, he had been succeeded by his son Barry Bingham Jr.         After Barry Bingham Jr. and his sisters, Eleanor and Sallie Bingham, were locked in a feud over control of the company, Barry Bingham Sr. decided to sell. The battle and the sale of the paper to the Gannett chain became front-page news throughout the country. Later, several books were written about the conflict and the family itself, including a memoir by Sallie that was critical of her parents.         Behind the scenes, Mrs. Bingham had been a force at the newspaper. She was a vice president and director and wrote editorials while her husband was overseas during World War II. For 26 years, until 1968, she was the editor of the book review section.         Mrs. Bingham was born Mary Caperton on Dec. 24, 1904, in Richmond, and as a young woman, she acted with Richmond's Little Theater. It was while she was a classics major at Radcliffe College that she met her husband, then a student at Harvard University. They were both involved in collegiate dramatics.         After graduating from Radcliffe in 1928, she spent a year studying in Greece on a fellowship. In 1931, she and Barry Bingham were married. They had five children, including two sons, Worth and Jonathan, who died in accidents.         The Binghams were active in Democratic politics and would, as Mrs. Bingham said, "get together with liberal friends on election night to listen to the results in sympathetic company."         When her son became publisher of the paper, he exchanged houses with his parents, as was the family tradition. The parents moved into the so-called Little House on the family estate, an Italianate villa where Mrs. Bingham continued to live after her husband's death.         In addition to her son and daughters, Mrs. Bingham is survived by six grandsons, four granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.       
         Tania Kurella Stern, a physical therapist and a co-translator, with her husband, of the work of many noted German writers, died on Monday at her home in Wiltshire, England. She was 91.         Mrs. Stern was born in Berlin, where her father was a prominent psychiatrist. She and the writer James Stern were married in Paris in 1935. They fled the Nazis in 1939 and settled in New York, where Mrs. Stern worked as a physical therapist. The poet W. H. Auden, a client who became a close friend, described a Christmas spent with the Sterns in the poem "Thank You, Fog."         Mr. and Mrs. Stern, who moved to England in 1955, collaborated on the English translations of works by Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Erich Maria Remarque and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, among others. They also translated the letters of Kafka and Sigmund Freud.         Mr. Stern died in 1993. No immediate family members survive.       
         Litia Namoura, a dancer and teacher, died on April 11 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 83.         The cause was heart disease, said Edward Coury, a cousin.         Early in her career, in the 1930's, Miss Namoura was a protegee and understudy of the modern-dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis. She performed Hindu and Eastern dances with Ragini Devi and La Meri in the 1940's, a time when she also began to teach dance. Miss Namoura also studied and worked with May O'Donnell, Martha Graham, Angel Cansino and Jose Fernandez.         She toured North Africa with the U.S.O. during World War II and also performed in India and the Middle East.         Miss Namoura's husband, Habib Katibah, died in 1958.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Marion Lounsbury Foster, who was for many years a social services administrator with the Disaster Staff of the American Red Cross, specializing in public and private emergencies, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn.         She was 97 and a longtime resident of New York City.         Beginning in 1917, Mrs. Foster was for 40 years the director of the Home Service Department of the Red Cross's Brooklyn chapter, finding help in times of need for the families of men and women in the armed forces and aid for people in distress after floods, storms, train wrecks and much smaller crises.         In 1931, her office provided Easter dresses to wives of disabled World War I veterans. And in 1938, she directed case workers in aiding victims of a disastrous hurricane that struck Long Island, providing services and financial relief to thousands of families.         Mrs. Foster, who retired in 1957, was also a founder and treasurer of the Brooklyn Association for Mental Health.         She was born in New York City and graduated from the Brearley School, Columbia University and the New York School of Social Work.         Her husband, William Jenkins Foster, died in 1958. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Pearl Rainwater Twyne, an animal rights advocate in the Washington area who helped draw national attention to the plight of the Tennessee Walking Horse, died last Friday in St. Alphonsus Hospital in Boise, Idaho. Mrs. Twyne, a longtime resident of Great Falls, Va., moved to Boise in 1993. She was 90.         Over the years, horses became her special concern. She led demonstrations against the exhibition of Tennessee Walking Horses, which were trained to prance in an exaggerated, high-stepping gait, sometimes through the use of caustic chemicals or heavy chains.         In 1964, when she attended the Carolina Walking Horse Celebration in Raleigh, N.C., with a veterinarian, a lawyer and two police officers to look for evidence of mistreatment, she was threatened by spectators and forced to flee.         Eventually, testimony by Mrs. Twyne and others before Congress led to the Horse Protection Act of 1970, a Federal law that bars abusive training techniques.         Mrs. Twyne was transformed from a lover of animals to an animal rights activist in the early 1940's when she called the authorities in her town to tend to a stray dog that had collapsed near her house on a hot summer day. When an attendant arrived, he threw the dog in the trunk of his car, slammed it shut and drove away.         Appalled, she and a few friends founded the Arlington Animal Welfare League in 1944. She was its president until 1967, and helped found the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies in 1959. She also was instrumental in establishing the Humane Society of Fairfax County.         Mrs. Twyne, a native of Joplin, Mo., moved to Washington in the 1920's and worked in the Department of Agriculture.         Her husband, Patrick Murray Twyne, died in 1967. She is survived by a sister, Ruth Kennedy of Boise.       
         Isabel Leighton Bunker, whose long career as an actress and writer embraced theater, journalism and television, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         The cause was a stroke, said Evan H. Rhodes, her son-in-law.         Miss Leighton began her career in the theater, appearing in several Broadway productions in the early 1920's. She went on to collaborate on six plays that were produced on Broadway, including "Mercenary Mary" (1925) and "Spring Again" (1941). The latter, which she wrote with Bertram Bloch, starred Grace George, C. Aubrey Smith and Joseph Buloff.         In the 1930's and 40's she wrote for various magazines and for the North American Newspaper Alliance, and served as a naval correspondent in World War II. She was the author or co-author of several books, including "My Boy Franklin," about Franklin D. Roosevelt, written with Gabrielle Forbush, and "Where Away," written with George Sessions Perry, the story of the World War II cruiser Marblehead.         She was the editor of "The Aspirin Age, 1919-41," a best-selling collection of articles -- by John Lardner, Howard Fast and others -- about life in the United States between the World Wars.         In the early 1950's she was moderator of a popular television program called "How Did They get That Way?," which dealt with psychiatry and mental health. She also served on the boards of several civic and philanthropic organizations, including the World Federation for Mental Health and the Menninger Foundation.         Miss Leighton's husband, Arthur H. Bunker, died in 1963. No immediate family members survive.       
         Marion Burbank Stevens Rice, a noted teacher and producer of dance by the pioneering modern dancers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, died on April 12 at the Highlands Long Term Care Center in Fitchburg, Mass.. She was 90 and lived in Ashby, Mass.         Mrs. Rice was known for the purity and vitality of her dancers and her dance restagings. She learned the Denishawn technique and most of the dances in the late 1920's and early 30's at the Braggiotti-Denishawn School of Dance in Boston, where she studied with Shawn and others. From 1929 through 1988, she was director of the Marion Rice Studio of the Dance in Fitchburg, Mass., and she continued to teach in the area after closing her school.         Mrs. Rice founded her own company, Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers, in the 1940's. The group gained widespread attention and critical praise in 1972 when it performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. The company received even greater critical praise five years later when it performed in its New York City debut, featuring the 72-year-old Mrs. Rice in a St. Denis solo.         In 1980, Mrs. Rice was invited to stage her version of "Soaring," a 1920 dance created by St. Denis and Doris Humphry, for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. The next year, the troupe participated in "The Early Years: American Modern Dance from 1900 through the 1930's," a festival organized by the State University of New York at Purchase. Mrs. Rice continued to teach until recently.         Mrs. Rice's husband, J. Parker Rice, died in 1965. She is survived by a daughter, Carolyn Brown of Millbrook, N.Y., a former lead dancer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; a son, J. Parker Rice Jr. of Ashburnham, Mass.; a sister, Elinor Stevens Cloutier of Ashburnham; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Avery Rowell, a cellist who was one of the country's best-known teachers of the instrument, died on April 21 at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.         The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter-in-law, Barbara Rowell.         Mrs. Rowell taught for 14 years at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Mills College and San Francisco State University.         Among her former students are Paul Tobias, a faculty member of the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and Bonnie Hampton, the president of Chamber Music America and a member of the San Francisco Trio.         Her husband, Edward Z. Rowell, a speech and philosophy professor at the University of California, died in 1975. She is survived by a son, Galen, of Berkeley, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Holly Harp, the California designer who went from a Sunset Boulevard sensation to a darling of Fifth Avenue salons, died on Monday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 55.         The cause of death was cancer, said her fiance, Mark Buchman.         Mrs. Harp, who captivated Hollywood with a rich hippie look in the 1960's and enthralled New York with soft clinging designs, was nominated for Coty awards two times.         But Mr. Buchman said on Friday in reporting her death that Mrs. Harp once described herself as a "counterculturalist," an apt description for a woman who began her career translating the clothes of the flower children into fashion for counterculture heroines.         When rock stars like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick began exchanging jeans for Mrs. Harp's fringed vests and tie-dyed velvet dresses, the Holly's Harp shop that she opened on Sunset Boulevard in 1968 became the center of a new style.         Her husband at the time, Jim, described the fashions, which included painted jersey, silk and chiffon dresses, and hip-hugger bell bottoms made from old draperies, as "somewhere between here and Mars."         Mrs. Harp came down to earth a bit after 1973, when she began selling to Fifth Avenue stores like Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman, whose fourth-floor Holly Harp shop showed her latest collection of $1,500 evening dresses three weeks ago.         But for all their initial counterculture flamboyance, the designs from the beginning included soft flowing chiffon dresses. Mrs. Harp had a disarming explanation for how she achieved that soft romantic look. "I took the construction out," she said.         For all the comparative elegance of her sensuous body-hugging evening dresses, Mrs. Harp's designs always had an edge, sometimes literally. In 1977, when one bright red creation reminded her of a flame, she proceeded to enhance the effect, taking a blowtorch and charring the garment's edges.         "I'm not trying to do tasteful little uniforms," she said in 1988. "Being dressed in perfect taste is very aging."         Mrs. Harp, a size 6 who designed for her own 5-foot-4-inch frame, had no patience for the presumed restrictions of age. As she put it when she appeared at an interview at the age of 47 wearing a short lame dress with glitter hose: "I still have a sexy little girl in me that won't quit."         Mrs. Harp was born in Buffalo and studied design at North Texas State University, where she met and married Mr. Harp, an English instructor. Her boutique became such a success that he abandoned his academic career. They divorced in 1980, but remained business partners.         Surviving are a son, Tom, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Sarah Bozzola of Orange, Conn., and Elizabeth Horn of Buffalo, and a brother, Thomas Speller of Buffalo.       
         Vita R. Ostrander, a former president of the American Association of Retired Persons who helped make the health care system a major national issue a decade before last year's debate on overhauling it, died on Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta. She was 72 and lived in suburban Decatur.         Her family said she had a heart attack while recovering from back surgery.         Mrs. Ostrander was a member of the A.A.R.P.'s board from 1976 to 1988 and its president for two of those years, 1984-86. She had earned those unpaid positions through her volunteer work in Georgia as an advocate for the elderly, and during her dozen years on the board gained a reputation as an effective advocate both inside and outside the huge organization, which now claims 33 million members.         "She really brought us into health care," the current president, Eugene Lehrmann, said yesterday, recalling that she had often built support for her views even as she formed them, in informal chats with fellow board members.         When the association, under her prodding, spoke out in favor of fee controls and a combination of private insurance and Government subsidies to pay for prescription drugs and catastrophic illnesses, it was often Mrs. Ostrander who did the speaking.         In an organization that likes to precycle as well as recycle its executive talent, Mrs. Ostrander was a representative at news conferences during her two years as president-elect, testified at Congressional hearings during her two years as president and continued to speak out during her two years as "immediate past president," an official association position.         Not one to shrink from confrontation, she once told a meeting of the American Medical Association that high costs had created a form of rationing of health care. And when she served on a Federal advisory panel that made only a vague reference to a need for Government subsidies in a report stressing the role of private insurance in protecting Americans against catastrophic medical costs, Mrs. Ostrander issued a stinging dissent, chiding her fellow panelists for obscuring a need for Government participation.         A native of Utica, N.Y., where her father operated a bakery, Mrs. Ostrander, whose maiden name was Romano, received a nursing degree from the University of Buffalo and spent 10 years as a Red Cross executive before settling in Atlanta and becoming a full-time volunteer on issues involving the elderly.         She is survived by her husband, Gladding, a retired Red Cross executive; a daughter, Sylvia Lucas of Columbia, S.C., and three grandchildren.       
         Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural, philanthropic and environmental causes, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause of death was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Goldman was the president of the sisterhood of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue and the chairwoman of the book and author series of UJA-Federation of New York.         In 1977 she co-founded the Council for a Beautiful Israel, an environmental group, with Ora Herzog, a former First Lady of Israel.         Mrs. Goldman was also active in the women's division of the American Technion Society and the Yeshiva University women's organization.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jacob E. Goldman; a brother, Rabbi Burton Mehler of the Bronx; three sisters, Jean Kelman of Queens and Gloria Mehler and Mindella Lamm of Manhattan; three sons, Shalom L., of East Thetford, Vt., and Ari L. and Dov E., of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         She is also survived by three stepchildren, Melvin Goldman of Chevy Chase, Md., Edith Goldman-Hoffman of Brookline, Mass., and Beth Goldman of Manhattan.         Correction:  May 3, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Sunday about Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural and philanthropic causes, misspelled the given name of a former First Lady of Israel with whom she founded an environmental group. The former First Lady is Aura Herzog, not Ora.       
         Janet Mathews Fitchen, a cultural anthropologist who studied rural poverty in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Dr. Fitchen brought the eye of an anthropologist and her profession's ethnographic methodology to the field of rural sociology. A professor of anthropology, she was the chairwoman of the department of anthropology at Ithaca College.         She wrote "Poverty in Rural America: A Case Study" (Westview, 1981), which surveyed pockets of poverty in the vast stretches of forests and fields of upstate New York. "I call it northern Appalachia," she told a reporter in 1984. "It is poverty that has been entrenched."         Her latest book was "Endangered Spaces, Enduring Places: Change, Identity and Survival in Rural America" (Westview, 1991). It chronicled the demographic, social, cultural, economic and agricultural changes transforming the Northeast. Both books are in print.         More recently, she researched poverty in other regions as an associate of the Western Rural Development Center in Corvallis, Ore. She had accepted a faculty appointment in the department of rural sociology at Cornell University and had planned to leave Ithaca College, where she had been a faculty member since 1977, at the end of the semester.         Dr. Fitchen was born in Manhattan but grew up on her family's dairy farm in Brewster, attending a one-room school. She graduated from Vassar College and received a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Illinois.         She did field work with Oscar Lewis in a Mexican village and received her Ph.D. in anthropology from Cornell.         Dr. Fitchen is survived by her husband, Douglas B. Fitchen, a Cornell professor; a son, John H., of La Jolla, Calif.; and two daughters, Katherine F. Nisbet of Bozeman, Mont., and Sylvia Fitchen of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Ellen Hermanson, a crusader in the battle against breast cancer, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 42 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         The disease was diagnosed in Ms. Hermanson in 1989, six months after the birth of her only daughter, Leora. She became actively involved in breast cancer issues by organizing survivor groups and speaking at national conferences and regional workshops.         Last November, Ms. Hermanson delivered a paper on the struggle to live with cancer pain to the annual National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship assembly in Washington. It was at this assembly that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court spoke for the first time about her own experience with breast cancer.         In 1991, Ms. Hermanson helped found the Jewish Healing Center in New York, an organization that provides spiritual assistance to people coping with serious illnesses. As editor of the center's quarterly newsletter, The Out-Stretched Arm, Ms. Hermanson published articles on breast cancer, support groups and health-care workshops. The center now has offices in New York and San Francisco.         In 1992, Judith Kaye, Chief Judge of New York State, appointed Ms. Hermanson the first executive director of the Judges and Lawyers Breast Cancer Alert. The group promotes breast cancer awareness and provides education and legal services.         Ms. Hermanson was also an active member of the national board of the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship, which provides support to cancer survivors, their friends and families and health care providers. She edited the coalition's quarterly newsletter, Networker.         Ms. Hermanson was most recently working on a project to let breast cancer survivors and their families communicate over the Internet. She was also editor of the Sloan-Kettering Annual Report.         Ms. Hermanson was born in Belmont, Mass., in 1952. She graduated from Connecticut College with honors in 1974 and received a master's degree in journalism from New York University in 1978.         She is survived by her husband, Hugo Mareno and her daughter of Manhattan; her parents, Harlow and Roslyn Hermanson of Belmont, and two sisters, Emily Hermanson Levin of Great Neck, L.I., and Julie Hermanson Ratner of New York City.         Correction:  April 13, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Hermanson, an advocate for survivors of breast cancer, misspelled her husband's name. He is Hugo Moreno, not Mareno. The obituary also misstated her residence. She lived in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. The article also misstated the name of a group whose board she served on. It is the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, not the National Coalition for Breast Cancer Survivorship.       
         Annie Fischer, a Hungarian pianist known for the elegance of her Mozart performances and her vital, prismatic approach to early Romantic repertory, died on Monday at her home in Budapest. She was 81.         Miss Fischer was a pianist who played with an intensity of concentration and focus that seemed almost at odds with the poetry and impetuousness of her interpretive style. She shunned the machinery of modern career-making and rarely gave interviews. Preferring not to be far from Budapest, she performed mostly in Europe, although she undertook several brief tours of the United States over the last 13 years. And because she disliked making recordings, the comparatively few disks she recorded for Deutsche Grammophon and EMI are prized by collectors.         Miss Fischer was born in Budapest on July 5, 1914, and studied with Anton Szekely and Ernst von Dohnanyi at the Franz Liszt Academy. She made her public performing debut in Budapest when she was 8, and she toured as a concerto soloist when she was 12.         Her mature career began in 1933 when she toured Europe as the winner of the first prize in the Franz Liszt International Piano Competition. In 1935 she married the musicologist and conductor Aladar Toth, who died in 1971. In 1941 they left Hungary for Sweden, and Miss Fischer suspended her performing career during World War II. She began touring Europe again in 1946, after she and her husband returned to Budapest. But she did not make her United States debut until 1961, when she played the Mozart Concerto in E flat (K. 482) with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.         Her American performances thereafter were sporadic, and she made her belated Carnegie Hall recital debut in 1982. In recent seasons, she gave recitals every two or three years at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Early in her career, Miss Fischer developed a large repertory that ranged from Bach to Bartok, but from the start her Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann performances were singled out for particular praise. Critics often noted that her appeal was in her interpretations rather than in her technique. She could expand rhythms beyond their natural boundaries, and particularly in her later years, complete accuracy in dense passages sometimes eluded her. Yet the impression one carried away from her performances was of an insightful and intensely musical player.         Miss Fischer was awarded the Kossuth Prize by the Hungarian Government three times.         She is survived by a sister, Magda Fischer of Budapest, and a stepson.       
         Bonnie Bird, a Martha Graham dancer in the 1930's and an internationally known teacher, died on Sunday at her home in Tiburon, Calif. She was 80.         The cause was cancer said Marion North, a friend and colleague.         Miss Bird was born in Portland, Ore., and was educated at the Cornish School of Fine Arts in Seattle, where she studied with Graham, who invited her to join her company in New York. She performed from 1933 to 1937, appearing in works that included "Celebration," "American Provincial," "Panorama" and "Chronicle."         Miss Bird was best known, however, as an imaginative, practical teacher of dance who believed strongly that dancers must not only be trained in their craft but must also be aware of and a part of the world around them. In 1937, she became head of the dance department at the Cornish School. Her students there included Merce Cunningham and Remy Charlip, and her accompanists were the composers John Cage and Lou Harrison.         In 1935, she was a member of the first dance faculty at the 92d Street Y, a center for modern dance in New York City. She also taught there from 1951 to 1963, establishing a program for children and children's dance teachers that became the Merry-Go-Rounders, a highly successful company that presented dance for children.         Miss Bird played an important part in the founding and development of the American Dance Guild and the Congress on Research in Dance. In 1974, she began a long association with the Laban Center for Movement and Dance in London.         Miss Bird's husband, Ralph Gundlach, died in 1978.         She is surived by two brothers, Scott, of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Bill, of Rossmore, Calif.; a daughter, Heidi Gundlach Smith of Willets, Calif.; two sons, John Scott Gundlach of Helen, Ga., and Michael Gundlach of Cordova, Alaska, and a grandaughter. A memorial tribute is to be held on April 30 at 6 P.M. at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue.
