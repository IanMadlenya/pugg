         Virginia Mayo, who began her film career as a chorus girl and comic foil and then proved herself an accomplished actress, died yesterday at a nursing home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., the Los Angeles suburb where she had lived for many years. She was 84.         Her friend Mary Walsh told The Associated Press of her death.         Ms. Mayo, who played opposite Bob Hope in ''The Princess and the Pirate'' (1944), cavorted with Danny Kaye in four of his early comedies, was badly abused by James Cagney in ''White Heat'' (1949) and sailed the seas romantically with Gregory Peck in ''Captain Horatio Hornblower'' (1952), was never completely able to overcome type casting that relied more on her good looks than her acting ability. But she won high critical praise for her performance as the unfaithful wife of a returning veteran in ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946), widely regarded as one of the finest movies to come out of the World War II homecoming experience.         Bosley Crowther, reviewing the film for The New York Times, said that Ms. Mayo was ''brassy and brutal'' as the wife of an Air Force bombardier, played by Dana Andrews, who returns home with neither job nor prospects.         In 1949, Ms. Mayo gave another highly regarded performance in ''White Heat,'' in which she played the wife of a psychopathic gangster.         Ms. Mayo, whose real name was Virginia Clara Jones, was born on Nov. 30, 1920, in St. Louis, the daughter of Luke W. and Martha Raustenstrauch Jones. She studied dancing and was briefly in the ballet corps of the St. Louis Municipal Opera. She took the name Mayo from her brother-in-law, Andy Mayo, whose vaudeville act she joined in 1937. The act, known as Pansy the Horse, made it to Broadway in ''Banjo Eyes,'' a 1940 revue starring Eddie Cantor.         In the early 1940's Ms. Mayo was given a screen test by the David O. Selznick studios, but no contract resulted. Samuel Goldwyn saw her in 1942 when she was performing in a revue at Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe in Manhattan and offered her a spot as a Goldwyn Girl.         Goldwyn saw to it that she received acting and speech lessons. Eleanore King, then one of Hollywood's top charm teachers, had her doubts about Ms. Mayo, complaining that her cheeks ''were too fat for screen work.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Mayo made her debut as a lead in 1944, playing opposite Bob Hope in ''The Princess and the Pirate,'' and then was given many roles in comedies and musicals. The films she made with Danny Kaye were ''Wonder Man'' (1945), ''The Kid From Brooklyn'' (1946), ''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' (1947) and ''A Song Is Born'' (1948). She also appeared as a Goldwyn Girl in the 1944 Kaye vehicle ''Up in Arms.''         She made a number of adventure films, among them ''The Flame and the Arrow'' (1950) and ''The Iron Mistress'' (1952).         Her film career began to fade in the 1950's. She appeared in ''She's Working Her Way Through College'' (1952), in which she co-starred with Ronald Reagan, but she never again got a prime dramatic role.         She remained active with touring companies in the 1960's and 70's, appearing in productions of ''No, No, Nanette'' and ''Barefoot in the Park,'' among other shows. She also appeared on television, in shows like ''Murder, She Wrote,'' ''Santa Barbara'' and ''Remington Steele.''         Ms. Mayo married Michael O'Shea, the actor, in 1947. He died in 1973. They had one daughter, Mary Catherine Johnston, who survives her, along with three grandsons.       
         Consuelo Velázquez, the songwriter who in 1941 created ''Bésame Mucho,'' a Latin hit that took on a life of its own worldwide, died on Jan. 22 in Mexico City. She was believed to have been 88.         The cause was respiratory problems, her family told The Associated Press.         ''Bésame Mucho'' is not so much an enduring standard as a global phenomenon. Translated into dozens of languages and performed by hundreds of artists, the song has been an emblem of Latin identity, an anthem of lovers separated by World War II and perennial grist for lounge singers everywhere.         Recorded by artists both serious (the Beatles) and saccharine (Mantovani), ''Bésame Mucho'' has had more than two million performances on radio and television, according to BMI, the music publishing organization.         The English version, written by Sunny Skylar in 1944, was a hit that year for the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, with vocals by Kitty Kallen and Bob Eberly.         Ms. Velázquez was born in Ciudad Guzmán, Mexico, in 1916. (She sometimes gave the date as 1920.) Trained as a concert pianist, she wrote the original Spanish lyrics for ''Bésame Mucho'' when she was 25 and, as she liked to say, had never been kissed.         The song's haunting melody, which Ms. Velázquez also wrote, is based on the aria ''Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruiseñor'' (''Plaints, or the Maiden and the Nightingale''), from the 1916 opera ''Goyescas,'' by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados.         Ms. Velázquez's lyrics have a simple dramatic urgency: Bésame, bésame mucho,/Como si fuera esta noche la última vez (''Kiss me, kiss me a lot,/as if tonight were the last time'').         The English lyrics (Bésame, bésame mucho,/Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine) add a generous dollop of schmaltz.         Among the strange bedfellows who have recorded the song are: Danny Aiello, Josephine Baker, Dave Brubeck, Vikki Carr, José Carreras, Charo, the Coasters, Nat King Cole, Xavier Cugat, Plácido Domingo, Bill Evans, the Flamingos, Connie Francis, Dexter Gordon, Chris Isaak, Harry James, Spike Jones, Diana Krall, Frankie Laine, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, Julie London, Trini Lopez, Dean Martin, Carmen McRae, Nana Mouskouri, Les Paul, Art Pepper, the Platters, Tito Puente, Artie Shaw and the 101 Strings Orchestra.         Ms. Velázquez's other songs, none of which rivaled the success of ''Bésame Mucho,'' include ''Amar y Vivir'' (''To Love and to Live'') and ''Verdad Amarga'' (''Bitter Truth'').       
         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80.         She died after several recent strokes, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's. Over the years, she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment, as in 1974, when she asserted that ''there is an undercurrent of resistance'' to integration ''among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination,'' including in her own district in Brooklyn.         ''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment. Her slogan was ''unbought and unbossed'' -- in the primary, she had defeated two other candidates, William C. Thompson, who she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, and Dolly Robinson. ''The party leaders do not like me,'' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time.         But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district, which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, were Democrats. That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer, a leader of the freedom rides in the south in the early 1960's, who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines, and Ralph Carrano, who ran as the Conservative candidate.         ''I am an historical person at this point, and I'm very much aware of it,'' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in.         Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House, which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee, an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers.         ''Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there,'' she said in a statement at the time. ''Only nine black people have been elected to Congress, and those nine should be used as effectively as possible.''         She said that the House speaker, John W. McCormack, had told her to ''be a good soldier'' and accept the agriculture assignment. Instead, she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, who gave out committee assignments. Before long, she was reassigned, first to the Veterans Affairs Committee and later to the Education and Labor Committees.         Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington. ''Our representative democracy is not working,'' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title, ''because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.''         In 1972, when she entered the presidential primaries, she did not expect to capture the Democratic nomination, which ultimately went to George S. McGovern. ''Some see my candidacy as an alternate and others as symbolic or a move to make other candidates start addressing themselves to real issues,'' she said at the time. She did not win a single primary, but in 2002, she said her campaign had been a necessary ''catalyst for change.''         She was also aware of her status as a woman in politics. ''When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black,'' she told The Associated Press in December 1982, shortly before she left Washington to teach at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. ''Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934. Mrs. Chisholm later described the relatives she encountered there as ''a strongly disciplined family unit.''         But she had her own strength, too: ''Mother always said that even when I was 3, I used to get the 6- and 7-year-old kids on the block and punch them and say, 'Listen to me.'''         Her professors listened to her at Brooklyn College, where she won prizes in debating. Some told her she should think about a political career.         First, though, she taught in a nursery school and earned a master's degree in elementary education at Columbia University. Working as the director of the Friends Day Nursery in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and the Hamilton-Madison House Child Care Center in Lower Manhattan, she became known as an authority on early education and child welfare.         When she decided to run for the New York State Assembly in 1964, she said the decision was straightforward: ''The people wanted me.''         She moved on to the House four years later, in the year when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election. A year later, she confirmed her reputation for independence when she endorsed John V. Lindsay, who was running for re-election as mayor of New York as the Liberal Party candidate.         By 1982, the political climate had changed, and Mrs. Chisholm left Washington after seven terms in the House, saying that ''moderate and liberal'' lawmakers were ''running for cover from the new right.'' But she also had personal reasons for deciding not to seek re-election that year: Her second husband, Arthur Hardwick, a Buffalo liquor store owner who had been in the New York State Assembly when Mrs. Chisholm was, had been injured in a car accident. (Her first marriage, to Conrad O. Chisholm, ended in divorce in 1977. Mr. Hardwick died in 1986.)         ''I had been so consumed by my life in politics,'' she said in 1982. ''I had no time for privacy, no time for my husband, no time to play my beautiful grand piano. After he recovered, I decided to make some changes in my life. I truly believe God had a message for me.''         She also sounded frustrated, saying she had been misunderstood for much of her career. She mentioned her hospital visit to George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who built his political career on segregation, after he had been wounded in an assassination attempt in 1972.         ''Black people in my community crucified me,'' she recalled. ''But why shouldn't I go to visit him? Every other presidential candidate was going to see him. He said to me, 'What are your people going to say?' I said: 'I know what they're going to say. But I wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone.' He cried and cried and cried.''         She maintained that her visit had paid off. ''He always spoke well of Shirley Chisholm in the South,'' she said, adding that she had contacted him in 1974, when she was looking for votes for a bill to extend federal minimum-wage provisions to domestic workers. ''Many of the Southerners did not want to make the vote. They came around.''         Mrs. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991 and said in 2002, ''I live a very quiet life.'' She said she spent her time reading biographies -- political biographies. ''I have faded out of the scene,'' she said.         When she left Washington, she said she did not want to go down in history as ''the nation's first black congresswoman'' or, as she put it, ''the first black woman congressman.''         ''I'd like them to say that Shirley Chisholm had guts,'' she said. ''That's how I'd like to be remembered.''       
         The Spanish soprano Victoria de los Angeles, whose sweet-toned lyric voice and beguiling expressivity earned her a devoted following during a career of more than four decades, died overnight Friday in a hospital in Barcelona, a spokesman for the Liceu Opera there said. Ms. de los Angeles, who was 81, had been admitted to the city's Teknon clinic with cardiorespiratory problems on New Year's Eve.         For sheer loveliness of timbre, affecting sensitivity, elegance of line and utter ease in florid passagework, she was hard to top. By the 1950's she was a mainstay of opera houses around the world and widely admired for her portrayals of leading lyric soprano roles, including Puccini's Mimi (from ''La Bohème'') and Madama Butterfly, Verdi's Violetta (from ''La Traviata''), and Massenet's Manon, Bizet's Carmen and Debussy's Mélisande.         Though her sound was not enormous, she knew how to project her voice so that it carried effortlessly in the opera house. She even sang lighter Wagner roles with effectiveness and allure, including Elisabeth in ''Tannhäuser,'' the role of her 1961 Bayreuth Festival debut in Germany, and Eva in ''Die Meistersinger.''         To some tastes Ms. de los Angeles lacked temperament. By her own admission she was not an intellectually probing artist. But at her best she was an exquisite, unmannered and deeply communicative singer. On stage, with her black hair, gleaming eyes and broad smile, she projected an openness and naïveté that, coupled with her creamy voice, audiences adored.         From the start of her career, Ms. de los Angeles was a devoted recitalist who sang an extensive repertory of German, French and Spanish songs. Her American recital debut program at Carnegie Hall in October of 1950 included such rarities at the time as a recitative and aria from Monteverdi's ''Orfeo.'' At the end of the recital she endeared herself to an already smitten audience by sitting on the closed lid of the piano and singing a group of Spanish songs accompanying herself on the guitar. In his review of that recital, Virgil Thomson, the demanding critic of The New York Herald Tribune, wrote, ''The voice is one of rare natural beauty, the schooling impeccable, the artistry first class.''         Victoria Gómez Cima was born in Barcelona on Nov. 1, 1923, to a musical family. She studied piano, voice and guitar at home, then continued her training at the conservatory in Barcelona, completing the six-year program in three years and graduating at 18 with the highest honors. That same year at a coffee house near the university she met Enrique Magriña, a law student. After a traditional long Spanish courtship they were married in 1948.         After the conservatory, instead of immediately pursing a career in opera, Ms. de los Angeles joined Ars Musicae, an ensemble that specialized in French and Spanish songs from the Renaissance to modern times and in German lieder. She made her recital debut in 1944 in Barcelona and, several months later, her professional debut in opera as the Countess in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' at the Liceu. After winning the Geneva International Singing Competition in 1947, she attracted the attention of the world's leading opera companies, and debuts at Covent Garden in London, La Scala in Milan and elsewhere soon followed.         Her Met debut in 1951 was as Marguerite in Gounod's ''Faust.'' For almost a decade she was a favorite at the Met. Among her highlights at the house was a 1958 performance as Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello'' with Mario Del Monaco in the title role and Leonard Warren as Iago, a performance that the Met has released as a special edition of a live historic broadcast.         In 1948 she began an association with EMI that lasted nearly 30 years and produced over 80 recordings including 21 complete operas. Among these are several classics, including a 1956 ''La Bohème'' with Ms. de los Angeles as Mimi and Jussi Björling as Rodolfo and Sir Thomas Beecham conducting.         Speaking in a 1977 interview with The New York Times about Carmen, a mezzo-soprano role that Ms. de los Angeles sang with assurance and distinction, she complained that many interpreters simply do not understand Spanish women. Carmen should be elegant, not crude and vulgar, she said, adding: ''Even the common Gypsy women have a pride and reserve. They stay faithful to one man at a time, no matter what. That is my Carmen.''         After 1961, Ms. de los Angeles focused her career on recital work. One motivation was to slow down so that she could devote more time to raising a family. She gave birth to two sons in the mid-1960's: Juan Enrique and Alejandro.         Though she sang with such intellectually rigorous German artists as the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Ms. de los Angeles said her more instinctive approach was a result of her nationality.         ''We are a people that sings naturally,'' she said in a 1980 interview, adding, ''When we have a sorrow, it is a wonderful sorrow; when we have a happiness, it is a wonderful happiness, it is a big happiness.''       
         Former Representative Tillie Fowler, who despite being the most powerful woman in Congress did not run for re-election in 2000 to keep a promise to serve only four terms, died yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 62.         She had suffered a brain hemorrhage two days earlier, a family spokesman, Tom Alexander, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Fowler was vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and No.5 in the House leadership when she left Congress. Her steely intelligence earned her the nickname Steel Magnolia. A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she was known for her expertise on military matters, including vigorous efforts to retain armed services bases in her Florida district.         After leaving Congress in 2001 and joining a law firm, she continued her leadership role in military matters as chairwoman of both the commission that investigated sexual abuse accusations at the United States Air Force Academy and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the secretary of defense.         Ms. Fowler was also on an independent panel that last year investigated the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, attributing the problem to a string of failures that led all the way up the chain of command to the Pentagon.         She was born on Dec. 23, 1942, in Milledgeville, Ga., where her father, Culver Kidd, owned a drug store. Mr. Kidd served for 44 years in the Georgia Legislature.         A photograph in Ms. Fowler's Congressional office showed her at age 7 playing on the desk of Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia. She recalled that she was arguing with him.         She earned a law degree from Emory University, where she also did her undergraduate work. She later worked as a Congressional aide and in the Nixon White House, in consumer affairs. In 1971, she moved to Jacksonville with her husband, Buck Fowler.         She threw herself into volunteer work, then used those contacts to run successfully for the Jacksonville City Council. Elected president of the Council, she had three members arrested in 1989, when they tried to walk out of a meeting, which would have prevented a quorum needed to pass the city budget.         In 1992, she ran for Congress, promising to serve no more than four terms. She received 57 percent of the vote and was unopposed in her next three races.         She got a seat on the Armed Services Committee and was elected co-chairwoman of the Freshman Republican Task Force on Reform. In her second term, she became a deputy whip for the Republicans. In late 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich gave her and Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, the tough assignment of investigating sexual harassment in the Army.         In 1998, Ms. Fowler was elected vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference on the vow that she would serve no longer than two years in the Republican leadership. She filed papers in 1999 to seek re-election, but later decided to keep her initial promise.         She is survived by her husband and her daughters, Tillie Anne, of Washington, and Elizabeth, of California.       
         Lisa Fittko, who achieved fame, particularly in Germany, by leading Jews and members of the anti-Hitler resistance from Nazi-occupied France to Spain, died on March 12 in Chicago. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, said Evelyn Marsh, her niece.         Ms. Fittko emerged from a leftist, artistic family to become active in the resistance to Hitler in the early months of his rule, then fled to continue the fight in other European countries for seven years. For seven tense months in 1940 and 1941, she escorted refugees on a tortuous path over the Pyrenees mountains so they could go on to Spanish and Portuguese ports to seek passage to safe havens.         Many of the people she helped were intellectuals, artists and anti-Nazi organizers. The first refugee she helped was Walter Benjamin, a Marxist literary critic and philosopher whose work has drawn new interest in recent years because of his provocative insights on subjects from consumerism to surrealism.         But that initial mission was thwarted when the Spanish authorities ordered the group to return to France because they lacked proper exit visas, a requirement that had not been enforced in the past and was ignored in the future. Mr. Benjamin died at the age of 48 in Room No.4 on the second floor of the Hotel de Francia, a cheap pension in Port-Bou, Spain, on Sept. 27, 1940, having apparently committed suicide.         Ms. Fittko had earlier helped the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who had been her friend in Paris, get out of a prison in France.         Ms. Fittko and her husband, Hans, became part of the rescue mission of Varian Fry, an American who is credited with saving about 2,000 people, many of them artists and intellectuals, including André Breton, Marc Chagall and Max Ernst.         Miriam Hansen, a professor of English and cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, said Ms. Fittko became well known in postwar Germany because Germans liked to find and honor people who resisted Hitler. She said Ms. Fittko's death was announced on German radio and television, and obituaries appeared in the major national newspapers. In 1986, the president of West Germany awarded her the Distinguished Medal of Merit, First Class.         In the United States, Ms. Fittko's story was eventually documented in several novels and films, including the 1998 documentary ''Lisa Fittko: But We Said We Will Not Surrender.''         She wrote two books about her experiences. One, ''Escape Through the Pyrenees,'' which was first published in West Germany in 1985, won that country's award for the political book of the year. It was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and, in 1991, into English by Northwestern University Press. The same press in 1993 published her ''Solidarity and Treason: Resistance and Exile, 1933-1940.''         Lisa Ekstein was born in 1909 in Uzhgorod in what was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; it later became part of Czechoslovakia, then part of the Soviet Union and today is part of Ukraine. Most of her childhood was spent in Budapest and Vienna; she was evacuated and sent to the Netherlands with other children for a year during World War I. After the war, her family moved to Berlin.         Through her father, a writer and a publicist for avant-garde artists there, she met many members of the Weimar intelligentsia.         While still in high school, she joined what Ms. Hansen characterized as a Communist organization. She wrote and distributed leaflets protesting torture in Nazi prisons.         At 24 she was working as a secretary and went to a rally to see Hitler. She was reprimanded for not raising her arm in salute. She told an interviewer from The Vancouver Sun in 1999 that her failure to do so was hardly intentional.         ''I was stupid, but not that stupid,'' she said.         She was soon pursued by the Gestapo, and in 1933, she fled to Prague, where she met Hans Fittko, a fellow exile and an even more committed leftist whom the Nazis sought to kill. They married on their odyssey through, among other places, Basel and Amsterdam, ending up in Paris in 1938. There, they continued helping refugees.         After Germany invaded France, Ms. Fittko was detained for a few months in a concentration camp for women at Gurs, France, along with others who had lived in Germany. It was there she aided her friend and fellow prisoner Hannah Arendt by helping to supply her with a stolen release document.         After the Fittkos found each other again, they made their way to Marseille, dodging the French authorities who were collaborating with the Germans. They planned to escape through Spain but separated because the Spanish had begun arresting men who they feared might make their way to Britain to fight Hitler.         Mr. Fittko tried to find sea passage from Marseille to Casablanca. His wife, as originally planned, had gone to the border to find a way to escape by land. In September 1940, Walter Benjamin knocked on the door of her room in Port-Vendres, saying Mr. Fittko had told him to ask her for help.         With the assistance of a local socialist mayor, who gave her an old map, she led Mr. Benjamin and two other refugees across the mountains to Port-Bou, a Spanish border town. Mr. Benjamin died there after swallowing some of the 50 morphine tablets he had earlier split with his friend Arthur Koestler.         Mr. Benjamin had been carrying a heavy, bulging briefcase that he told Ms. Fittko contained ''the only copy of his latest writing.'' She wrote that he said it was ''more important than I am, more important than myself.''         The briefcase was lost after his death and its contents remain unknown.         For years people suspected that it might have been his lost work on the Parisian arcades, iron-and-glass-roofed shopping corridors, which provoked penetrating philosophical insights on the part of Mr. Benjamin. But those papers were discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, where Mr. Benjamin's friend the essayist Georges Batailles had hidden them from the Nazis. They were published in West Germany in 1982.         Howard Eiland, who translated them as ''The Arcades Project,'' published in 1999 by Harvard University Press, said the contents of the lost briefcase remained a mystery. He said, ''This sounds like it was something completely different that no one knows about.''         Ms. Fittko was soon joined on the French side of the border by her husband, who had not been able to find sea passage. They delayed their own escape when Mr. Fry asked them to help take refugees into Spain. They pretended to be vineyard workers and took people across the mountains on what was called the F route (for Fittko) two or three times a week for seven months. The number of those they helped is sometimes estimated in the hundreds; not one was caught, they said.         The Fittkos eventually escaped to Cuba, then went on to Chicago, where Ms. Fittko's brother lived. Mr. Fittko died in 1960, and Ms. Fittko left no immediate survivors.         She returned to Spain several times to look for Mr. Benjamin's lost briefcase, but never found it.         Correction:  March 22, 2005, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Lisa Fittko, the anti-Hitler activist, misspelled the surname of the French essayist who helped hide the writings of Walter Benjamin, the German literary critic and philosopher. He was Georges Bataille, not Batailles.       
         Col. Mary A. Hallaren, who led the Women's Army Corps into the ranks of the regular military in 1948, died on Feb. 13 in McLean, Va. She was 97.         Her death was announced by the Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., which made her a member in 1996.         Colonel Hallaren commanded the first battalion of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps to serve in Europe, the largest unit of women to serve overseas in World War II. Shortly afterward the word auxiliary was dropped, making it the Women's Army Corps.         She returned from three years in Britain and France with several decorations, including the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and the Croix de Guerre of France. She was then among the officers who helped to overcome strong resistance and to persuade Congress to pass the Women's Armed Services Integration Act.         Signed into law in 1948, the act accepted women into the regular armed services for the first time in United States history. Colonel Hallaren was the first woman to be sworn in as an officer of the Regular Army outside its medical branch.         She was named director of the Women's Army Corps, Regular Army, which gave enlistees a chance to try for any noncombat position and provided for an initial peacetime strength of 18,000. But the rank of colonel was the highest Mary Hallaren attained even under the new system.         She directed the corps during the Korean War until 1953, then had other military assignments. She decided to retire from the military in 1960, well before the Women's Army Corps was finally dissolved and women were formally integrated into all the services in the 1970's without restrictions on rank.         ''The Greatest Generation,'' by Tom Brokaw (Random House, 1998), devoted much of a chapter to Mary Hallaren, who always said she was five feet tall and relied in her job on a no-nonsense presence and a voice that commanded attention.         ''She was called the 'Little Colonel' because of her diminutive stature,'' Mr. Brokaw wrote, ''but when it came to promoting a wider role for women in the military, she was a towering figure, a godmother to the women who continued to struggle to find their places in the male-dominated military establishment.''         After retiring, Colonel Hallaren helped organize Women in Community Service, an outgrowth of the civil rights and women's rights movements and the War Against Poverty of the 1960's. She became its first executive director in 1965 and oversaw its growth into a national organization, known as WICS.         Based in Alexandria, Va., WICS recruits women for the Job Corps and helps women in need with job placements and other services. Colonel Hallaren retired once again in 1978.         Mary Agnes Hallaren was born in Lowell, Mass., and studied there at State Teachers College. Certified as an instructor in remedial reading, she took courses in psychology and education at Harvard and Boston Universities.         She enlisted in the WAAC in 1942 and trained at Officer Candidate School in Fort Des Moines, Iowa. She served as an administrative officer stateside until, by then a captain, she was named commanding officer of the WAAC Separate Battalion in July 1943 and sailed for England and duty with the Eighth Air Force.         She became Air WAC staff director, in charge of WAC personnel assigned to both the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces, and was on duty during the V-1 and V-2 bombardments of London. In March 1945 she was named WAC director for the European Theater, commanding 6,000 members, the largest WAC contingent outside the United States.         Mary Hallaren was teaching junior high school when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and she instinctively followed her brothers to enlist.         ''To me there was no question that women should serve,'' she said later.         She had to stand on her toes to meet the height requirement for enlistment. As she recalled it, she was challenged by a doubtful recruiter but passed muster after she told him, ''You don't have to be six feet tall to have a brain that works.''       
         Moura Lympany, the colorful and elegant British concert pianist whose career lasted more than 65 years, died on March 28 in Menton, France. She was 88.         Her death was confirmed by her former French managers, Bureau de Concerts de Valmalete.         Ms. Lympany avoided specialization, yet she is often associated with Russian music, particularly Rachmaninoff (she was the first to record his complete Preludes) and Khachaturian. She gave Khachaturian's piano concerto its first performances outside the Soviet Union, touring with it in 1940.         She also championed British composers, like Alan Rawsthorne (whose piano concerto she played in Paris immediately after the liberation in World War II), Cyril Scott, Benjamin Dale and others.         Ms. Lympany was born Mary Gertrude Johnstone on Aug. 18, 1916, in Saltash, Cornwall, England. Her mother, who had been a governess in St. Petersburg, Russia, before marrying an army officer, was her first piano teacher, and sent her to school in a convent in Liège, Belgium, when she was 6, setting the tone for a nomadic and international life.         After a few years in Belgium, Ms. Lympany returned to London, where she heard a child prodigy play a concerto with the conductor Basil Cameron and asked her mother if she could do the same. She made her concerto debut under Cameron when she was 12, playing the Mendelssohn G-minor Concerto. It was Cameron who advised her to spice up her name a bit, so she replaced her first name with Moura, a Russian diminutive, and Lympany, a variant of her mother's maiden name.         She studied in Vienna with Paul Weingarten, then in London with Mathilde Verne and Tobias Matthay, who remained an important influence. In the first Liszt competition in Budapest in 1933, she took second place to Annie Fischer; in the 1938 Queen Elisabeth International Competition of Belgium she came in second to Emil Gilels. During World War II she became popular in Britain by performing in the National Gallery lunchtime concerts organized by Dame Myra Hess.         After the war she embarked on a major international career. She made her New York debut in 1948 at Town Hall; Noel Straus in The New York Times described her playing as having ''a refreshing and irresistible wholesomeness, a freedom from exaggerations, an impeccable taste, a sanity, and at the same time a definite individuality.''         In 1944 she married Colin Defries, a colonel, engineer and amateur pianist; they were divorced in 1950. In 1951 she married Bennet Korn, an American radio-advertising executive. She had two miscarriages before giving birth to a premature baby who lived less than two days. The second marriage ended in 1961. Ms. Lympany later had a double mastectomy and a difficult period in her career, but had a minor renaissance in the 1970's.         She lived in London, Monte Carlo and the French village Rasiguères in the Languedoc, where in 1981 she founded a festival ''of music and wine'' that ran through 1992. A passionate gardener, she also owned a vineyard. She wrote her autobiography in 1991.         She became somewhat infamous in Britain for her appearance on the popular radio program ''Desert Island Discs.'' When asked to choose which records she would take with her to a desert island, she selected her own recordings.         ''My records are damned good,'' she said.       
         Diane Knippers, a religious strategist who helped conservative Christians raise an increasingly loud and unified voice in the traditionally liberal bastions of mainline Protestantism in recent years, died on Monday in Arlington, Va. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, according to the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a small but influential Washington group, of which Mrs. Knippers, a laywoman, was the longtime president.         The institute is a resource center for conservative members of the mainline denominations -- primarily the Presbyterian, Methodist and Episcopal Churches -- disaffected by their churches' policies, especially on sexuality.         When the Episcopal Church consecrated its first gay bishop in 2003, Mrs. Knippers, a member of the church's Standing Commission on Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations, helped lay the groundwork for a rebellion that threatens to split the church.         Her detractors accused her of exploiting and deepening divisions in churches that need healing. But she said she was merely working to give the silent majority its say in church policy.         ''It's pretty clear that the church elite in the mainline denominations are to the left of the people in the pews,'' she told The New York Times last year.         John Green, a specialist in religion and politics at the University of Akron, credited Mrs. Knippers with changing people's ideas about what it meant to be a Protestant.         ''Prior to her activities, traditionalists within mainline denominations were mostly an afterthought or a footnote,'' he said, ''but she was able to empower them and bring them together.''         The institute shared tips on how a conservative congregation could withhold money from its denomination's headquarters, how to win seats on judicial committees and how to force heresy trials of gay members of the clergy.         Mrs. Knippers also forged new links among traditionalists in the mainline churches, Roman Catholics and the much larger network of evangelical Christians from Baptist and Pentecostal churches.         ''She was able to bring together Catholics, all kinds of Protestants and evangelicals who agree on the essential teachings of historic Christianity,'' said Roberta Ahmanson, a conservative philanthropist and one of the institute's main donors.         Mrs. Knippers urged evangelical Christians to reach across the lines of faith to their Muslim counterparts.         ''There are things we may have in common and on which we could become political and cultural allies,'' she told an interviewer in 2003, ''defending the unborn, upholding marriage, caring for refugees, advocating religious freedom.''         Mrs. Knippers also worked through the institute to raise public awareness of the persecution of Christians in Asia and Africa.         At her death, Mrs. Knippers's influence was still growing. Two months ago, Time magazine named her one of the country's top 25 evangelicals.         Mrs. Knippers was born Diane LeMasters in Rushville, Ind., in 1952, to a Methodist minister and his wife, a schoolteacher. Before earning a master's degree in sociology of religion at the University of Tennessee, she married Edward Knippers, an artist who paints biblical scenes.         After the fall of the Soviet Union, Mrs. Knippers, who became the institute's president in 1992, gave the group its domestic focus, first on radical feminism within the churches, then on homosexuality.         Hers was a level and persuasive voice. Randall Balmer, the head of the religion department at Barnard College, who called her ''one of the essential strategists for the religious right at the turn of the 21st century,'' said she came off like ''a very bright and sophisticated housewife.''         Mrs. Knippers is survived by her husband; her parents, Clarence E. and Vera LeMasters of Lakeland, Fla.; and a brother, Douglas LeMasters, of Fairfax, Va.         She was found to have cancer in 2003 but kept a demanding schedule until recently. Six weeks before her death, she appeared in Washington to promote a book of which she was co-editor, ''Toward an Evangelical Public Policy: Political Strategies for the Health of the Nation.'' While she had lost her speaking voice, Mrs. Knippers delivered a written address on the gap in religious values between Democrats and Republicans that sounded a valedictory note.         ''I'm an evangelical and I am a Republican,'' the statement read. ''But this gap doesn't please me at all because my religious convictions trump my party commitments. I want Christians to be salt and light -- a strong influence -- across the political landscape.''       
         Dale Messick, a pioneering newspaper cartoonist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession by creating Brenda Starr, the glamorous red-haired journalist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession, died on Tuesday in Sonoma County, Calif. She was 98.         She died after a long decline that began with a stroke in 1998, her daughter, Starr Rohrman, told The Associated Press. She had been caring for her mother at her home in Penngrove, Calif.         Ms. Messick was born on April 11, 1906; Brenda Starr was born in June 1940. An impossibly glamorous redhead, her appearance was inspired by Rita Hayworth; her first name came from the most famous debutante of the day, Brenda Frazier, and her last name was chosen because she was the star reporter on The Flash.         The Brenda Starr comic strip was a symphony of décolletage, good legs precariously balanced on high-heeled shoes, and Dior-like clothing that no woman would be likely to wear to a newspaper office.         During the war she was an ace reporter, chasing spies and other malefactors in cities and in jungles, fighting off sharks, giant squids and other ravenous animals, but selling war bonds, too. Her red hair was always attractively coiffed; her eyes always glistened with tiny starbursts.         She found time for romance with her mystery man, Basil St. John, a lean, square-jawed hunk who wore an eye patch and whose only other defect was that he was dying of an exotic disease. This frequently sent him to the jungle in search of a rare black orchid whose serum gave him temporary respite. While he was away, Brenda had more suitors than Penelope, but she remained loyal to her true love. Brenda finally married Basil in 1976, whereupon he vanished again on another orchid hunt.         As for Ms. Messick, she was married twice, to Everett George and Oscar Strom, and both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, from her first marriage, and two grandchildren.         Of her heroine's profession, she once explained, ''She was already a reporter when the strip started, but she was sick and tired of covering nothing but ice-cream socials. She wanted a job with action, like the men reporters had.''         But Ms. Messick knew little about the newspaper business and refused to learn about it, saying it might spoil her imagination.         ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'' was sometimes criticized by journalists for its outlandish depiction of their profession. In one strip, Brenda brings a typed story to The Flash late at night and hands it to a custodian, who somehow gets it into the next day's paper. On another occasion, she finds herself in an airplane she cannot fly, so she parachutes to safety, somehow landing in front of her editor's window.         And, in perhaps the greatest breach of authenticity, she talks back to her managing editor.         Ms. Messick hired other people to draw cars and other mechanical contraptions, animals and nature scenes. But for four decades, only she drew Brenda Starr's face and body.         Dalia Messick, born in South Bend, Ind., spent two years in the third grade and two years in the eighth grade and did not get her high school diploma until she was 20, and then only at the urging of her parents, Cephas Messick, a sign painter and vocational arts teacher, and Bertha Messick, a milliner; her work inspired some of Brenda's fetching hats.         Ms. Messick changed her name to Dale after she encountered discrimination against women entering the newspaper cartooning business. She told Norma Lee Browning of The Saturday Evening Post: ''Brenda is the glamorous girl I wished I was. ... She's what most women wish they were and what most men wish their women were, too.''         She originally thought of her character as a girl bandit, but was talked into making her a reporter by an aide to Joseph Medill Patterson, founder and publisher of The Daily News of New York and head of The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate.         Ms. Messick had started drawing comic strips in school. After leaving school, she studied art for a summer in Chicago and worked for greeting card companies there and in New York, continuing to work on her comic strips at night. None were published until ''Brenda Starr'' was accepted by the syndicate.         After Brenda Starr appeared, Ms. Messick dyed her hair red to match Brenda's. ''I am Brenda Starr,'' she would say to interviewers.         ''Brenda Starr'' was twice adapted for the screen, first as a 1945 serial with Joan Woodbury, and later as a feature movie starring Brooke Shields. Shot in 1986, it was not released until 1992, when it opened to dismal notices. Ms. Messick warned everyone she met not to see it.         However, over the years, there were Brenda Starr dolls and even a postage stamp with Brenda's likeness on it, part of a series on 20 classic comic characters.         At its height, ''Brenda Starr'' appeared in 250 papers and is still syndicated by Tribune Media Services. Ms. Messick retired from drawing the strip in the mid-1980's, and it was passed on to other artists, all women. She said she did not like the way later versions of Brenda Starr looked.         In the 1990's, she developed a new comic character called ''Granny Glamour,'' who appeared in a single-panel cartoon in a publication for the elderly in California.         In her 80's, she boasted of juggling three boyfriends simultaneously.         ''All three wouldn't make one good man,'' she told an interviewer, ''but at my age, you can't be too choosy.''       
         Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall, a New York arts patron for 50 years and a supporter of medical institutions, died on April 22 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hall, a sister of the late publisher Walter H. Annenberg, shared her fortune with many beneficiaries. Among her favorites were the Museum of Modern Art and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Mrs. Hall was born in Milwaukee. Her parents were Moses and Sadie Annenberg. She graduated from the Calhoun School and studied at the Art Students League of New York. With her second husband, William Jaffe, she assembled an outstanding art collection that included European paintings, sculpture and antique furniture; Chinese porcelain; pre-Colombian artifacts; and Renaissance drawings.         A member of the Modern Museum's International Council since 1970, a trustee since 1979 and a leading member of various museum committees, she stood in the forefront of donors to its collections. Among the works she gave to the museum were pieces by Bonnard, Picasso, Miró and Vuillard. Another notable gift, made with Mr. Jaffe, was a selection of 16 prints by Edvard Munch.         Mrs. Hall was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum as well. She financed a scholarship in art history at Yale University and in 1960 endowed the Jaffe-Friede Art Gallery at Dartmouth College.         She was also a donor to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she endowed a lecture series at the medical school.         Mrs. Hall's first marriage, to Kenneth Friede, ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Mr. Jaffe, a corporate lawyer; he died in 1972. She later married Melville Hall of Palm Beach, who died in 1991. She is survived by three sons, John Friede of Rye, N.Y., Robert Friede of Newton, Mass., and Thomas Jaffe of Manhattan; a sister, Enid Haupt of Greenwich, Conn.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Laredo, a pianist equally at home in chamber music and solo works who was known for landmark recordings of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, died on Wednesday at her apartment in New York. She was 67.         Ms. Laredo, who played her last concert on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had cancer and died in her sleep, said her manager, James Murtha.         The concert was one of a series she had given for 17 years at the Met called ''Concerts With Commentary,'' in which Ms. Laredo played and spoke engagingly about music. The series had become an important part of the New York concert scene, where she was a frequent presence.         Just two days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Ms. Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Alice Tully Hall debut with a recital there. It was the opening concert of the 2001 Lincoln Center season, and Ms. Laredo addressed the audience beforehand, saying: ''It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.''         Ms. Laredo was a pianist in the Romantic mold, a dynamic performer concerned with texture and color. In recent years, Mr. Murtha said, her career as a soloist with orchestras had waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals, chamber concerts and accompanying duties.         When she was first on the rise, in the 1970's, Ms. Laredo was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others -- Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example.         ''Every time we did interviews in those early days, she was asked how does it feel to be a woman pianist,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''She wanted to be a pianist, period.''         Ruth Meckler was born in Detroit on Nov. 20, 1937. She attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin. She graduated in 1960 and that same year married the violinist Jaime Laredo, with whom she collaborated musically. They later divorced. Ms. Laredo is survived by their daughter, Jennifer Laredo, who lives in London with her husband, the cellist Paul Watkins, and by a granddaughter.         Ms. Laredo made her debut with an orchestra in 1962, in a program led by Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, 12 years later. Her Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came only in 1981.         At Curtis, Serkin schooled her in the basics of Mozart and Beethoven, turning a disapproving eye on her youthful love for Rachmaninoff. But it was with his music, as well as that of his fellow Russian Scriabin, that she made her mark.         In the 1970's she recorded two pioneering and acclaimed sets: the entire Scriabin piano sonatas, for the now-defunct Connoisseur label, and the complete solo repertory of Rachmaninoff, on seven LP's for CBS Masterworks.         When Ms. Laredo went to Serkin to ask if he thought she could handle the Rachmaninoff, he gave his blessing. '''You must do it' was the answer he gave me,'' Ms. Laredo said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times.         But preparing for the recordings was a fearsome and wearing task. ''I had to learn the many, many Rachmaninoff pieces that no one plays, and I found out why no one does,'' she said. ''It's because they're so hard.'' She later channeled her love for Rachmaninoff into scholarship, preparing a new edition of his piano preludes for the C.F. Peters music publisher.         The Scriabin LP's came when little of his music was available on record, and they helped spark a surge of his popularity in the United States. Ms. Laredo said that she first heard his music at a concert of Vladimir Horowitz and was dazzled.         Bernard Holland, a Times music critic, wrote of her playing of Scriabin's music: ''Ms. Laredo's sensuous, beautifully controlled playing caught its mad and slightly evil quality.''         Correction:  June 17, 2005, Friday  An obituary of the classical pianist Ruth Laredo on May 27 referred imprecisely to the label that issued her recordings of the Scriabin piano sonatas in 1970. It is Connoisseur Society, not Connoisseur, and it remains in business.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Grete Sultan, a pianist and teacher who was both a performer of Bach and Schubert and a mentor to John Cage and his contemporaries, died in her sleep at St. Vincent's Hospital last Sunday morning. She was 99.         ''Basically, her heart gave out,'' said Robert Jurgrau, a former student and close friend. She had been hospitalized for about a week with pneumonia.         Ms. Sultan was a matter-of-fact proponent of the avant-garde. Her calling cards included Bach's Goldberg Variations, which she performed with all the repeats in downtown New York and, later, in uptown concert halls -- which, in the 1940's, before Glenn Gould's 1955 recording helped make the piece familiar fare, was practically outré.         But Ms. Sultan was open to all kinds of music. She met Cage in 1945; his ''Études Australes'' from the mid-1970's, based on notes derived from star charts, were written for her. Other contemporary composers whose works she performed included Earle Brown, Stefan Wolpe, Alan Hovhaness, Ben Weber and Christian Wolff, one of her students.         She said in a 1996 interview: ''Music is music. That's all.''         Johanna Margarete Sultan was born on June 21, 1906, in Berlin. Her family was musical -- two of her aunts had studied with Clara Schumann -- and Richard Strauss, Artur Schnabel, and Ferruccio Busoni were regular visitors to her childhood home. So was the American pianist Richard Buhlig, who introduced her to the composer Henry Cowell and the music of other contemporary composers. At the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, she completed a course of study in only three years, working with Leonid Kreutzer. But a more important mentor was the pianist and conductor Edwin Fischer, teacher of Alfred Brendel, Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim, with whom she began private lessons after graduation.         Her burgeoning concert career was, however, abruptly curtailed by Hitler's rise to power, after which Jewish pianists could no longer play German music, although Arturo Toscanini set up some recitals for her in Italy. In 1941, Buhlig helped her escape to the United States, where she arrived with a suitcase and the clothes on her back. (Her mother was able to join her in 1946; a sister also managed to escape.)         Ms. Sultan began teaching at Vassar College and at the 92nd Street Y in New York before taking a post at the Masters' School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in 1952, which she held until 1971. It was Buhlig who introduced her to his former student Cage; Ms. Sultan, in turn, introduced Cage to her student Mr. Wolff, who gave Cage his first copy of the I Ching. In addition to Mr. Wolff, her students included the composer Lucia Dlugoszewskiwho moved to New York to study Bach with her in 1948 and ended up meeting the choreographer Erick Hawkins, who had a studio next door.         Ms. Sultan also continued to perform in concert throughout her life, winning praise for her natural, unflashy manner and musical integrity, and doggedly following her own musical tastes through the years, performing now Schubert, now Schoenberg, now Stravinsky, now Cage or Feldman without proselytizing and with equal aplomb. In 1996, shortly after her 90th birthday, she played the Goldberg Variations at Merkin Hall. The same year brought the release of the first of two retrospective CD sets that give a flavor of her performances and the breadth of her repertory.         ''She clearly strives for something higher from music than emotion or adventure,'' wrote Mark Swed, the Los Angeles Times music critic, after that 1996 concert. ''Her Bach has the modernist's attention paid to the smallest detail of sound and structure. The feeling here is that the spirit will soar much higher if it isn't pushed.''         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Nan Kempner, one of New York's most serene hostesses and clotheshorses, a glittering fixture at social events and fashion shows on both sides of the Atlantic for decades, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was emphysema, said her husband, Thomas. A heavy smoker until about 10 years ago, she had been breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank.         As slim as a stalk of celery and, as she proudly acknowledged, ''possibly one of the first people to have plastic surgery,'' Mrs. Kempner was a member of fashion's Hall of Fame and a Park Avenue hostess whose table was considered one of the best in Manhattan.         An original ''social X-ray,'' the phrase coined by Tom Wolfe to describe the premier rich and thin socialites of the Upper East Side, she never hesitated to admit that she loved making an entrance, loved being noticed and loved being photographed. She was a tireless and in-demand guest at every A-list function she could squeeze into a schedule that included trips each year to London, Paris, Gstaad, Venice, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vail and Nassau for couture shows, parties, skiing and sunning.         Mrs. Kempner was known for her self-deprecating sense of humor and for being one of the few women slender enough to look, and feel, comfortable on the ubiquitous narrow gilt chairs of the couture salons. But she never considered comfort a major factor. She was simply ''crazy'' about clothes, cheerfully describing herself as an insatiable shopper who spent ''more than I should, and less than I want.''         ''The best part of a party is getting dressed to go,'' she often said. When her children left the nest, she turned their rooms into walk-in closets.         She was born Nan Field Schlesinger in San Francisco on July 24, 1930. Her father, Albert Schlesinger, known as Speed, owned one of California's largest Ford dealerships, and her mother, Irma, was a woman her daughter called ''an extraordinary fashion plate, who cared terribly about how she looked and who started me in couture as a child.''         After graduating from the Hamlin School in San Francisco, Mrs. Kempner entered Connecticut College for Women, but left before graduation. During a junior year abroad, she studied at the Sorbonne and had what she called ''painting lessons'' with Fernand Léger.         ''He said I was a disgrace, that I had so little talent I should go back to San Francisco and stop wasting my parents' money,'' she recalled. ''It wasn't exactly endearing, but it was true.''         After working briefly as a volunteer at the San Francisco Museum of Art, she was married in 1952 to Thomas L. Kempner, chairman of Loeb Partners, the investment banking house, and a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, the founder and former head of the firm. In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Thomas Kempner Jr. of Manhattan and James L. Kempner of Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Adeline Field Kempner of Manhattan; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Kempner entertained in a duplex apartment whose rooms were lined with antique silk panels or hand-painted French wallpaper with a lush, intertwining floral design. There were two paintings by René Magritte, a couple of bronze bas-reliefs by Robert Graham and tables piled high with art books and ancient Chinese bric-a-brac. The apartment also housed a small gym, where Mrs. Kempner exercised relentlessly, keeping herself thin enough to slip into the mannequins' dresses -- garments worn once by models on runways -- that she bought at a discount in Paris, Milan and New York.         Although she bought clothes from many leading couturiers, she was said to own thousands of Yves Saint Laurent creations and told The Independent of London in a 1994 interview that she had missed only one of his last 63 shows. She relished the flights of imagination that a well-chosen outfit allowed.         ''I remember in the 70's,'' she told The Independent, ''our car would drop the kids off at school, then Tommy would pick me up, and he'd say, 'Now, who are we today?' and I'd be Pocahontas, Nanook of the North, I'd be -- God knows -- the River Boat Queen. It was such fun.''         In addition to buying, wearing and collecting clothes, many of which she donated to museums' costume institutes and various charities, Mrs. Kempner served on a number of charitable boards and benefit committees, gave occasional courses in couture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at New York University, and flirted with a number of other careers. In the 1960's, she was a special editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine; in the early 70's, she was a design consultant for Tiffany & Company; and in the 1980's, she was a correspondent for French Vogue.         In the late 90's, she became an international representative for Christie's, a job she defined as ''a shill to bring friends in.'' Her book of recipes and happenings, ''R.S.V.P.: Menus for Entertaining From People Who Really Know How,'' was published by Clarkson Potter in 2000, with the proceeds going to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         In a 1999 article in Town & Country, Annette Tapert asked Mrs. Kempner how she would describe her look. ''Artificially relaxed,'' she responded. ''It takes a lot of work to look relaxed. I've always liked being noticed, and I work hard at it. I'll never forget one day when my son Jamie and I were walking down the street and he asked, 'Mummy, do you mind if I walk on the other side of the street?' And I said, 'Why?' and he said, 'Because people stare!' But frankly, I couldn't go mail a letter if I didn't feel I looked all right.''         Then again, she once said: ''I tell people all the time I want to be buried naked. I know there will be a store where I'm going.''       
         Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, an educator who concluded that bored high school students should be sent straight to college and started Simon's Rock College to prove the point, died on Monday in Canaan, Conn. She was 95.         Her death was announced by Judith Monachina, spokeswoman for the college, in Great Barrington, Mass., which is now part of Bard College. Mrs. Hall, as the headmistress of a girls' prep school, perceived that adolescents were maturing faster than in the past, and that high schools were not meeting the challenge. So in 1964, she began what she called ''an early college'' for young women. Students who otherwise would have been in the last two years of high school instead took the first two years of college.         Leon Botstein, president of Bard, explained in an interview that Mrs. Hall abhorred the way adolescents were ''infantilized,'' when they were capable of doing high-level academic work. He said that her ideas had been adopted by more and more colleges, and that Bard itself had intensified its ''early-college'' efforts by beginning a high school in New York City in 2001 to teach college-level courses.         The later Bard program received funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also given millions to other early college programs on the theory they will help reduce dropout rates. Tom Vander Ark, executive director of the foundation's education program, credited Mrs. Hall's inspiration.         Mrs. Hall's mission was intensely personal. In addition to spending more than $6 million of her own, she gave 200 acres of her family's farmland, buildings included, to start the college, which became coeducational in 1970. She named it for a rock on which she had played as a child.         Elizabeth Blodgett was born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1909. Her father made a fortune in the chewing gum industry.         She later attended public and private schools in the Great Barrington area. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass., in 1928, and then attended Knox College for a year.         In 1930, she married Livingston Hall, who was later a professor and administrator at Harvard Law School. After having four children, she entered Radcliffe College, one of the first adults to do so, and graduated in 1946.         After holding several other jobs, she became head of the history department, then headmistress, at the Concord Academy, a private girls' school in Concord, Mass. An article in Mademoiselle in 1969 said she turned ''a genteel finishing school'' into ''one of the most dynamic girls' preparatory schools in the East.''         It was a time when educators were scrambling to jump-start education to keep up with the Russians, in space and elsewhere. Initiatives ranged from Advanced Placement courses that allowed students to do college-credit work while still in high school to the experimental admissions of bright high school students.         Earlier, in the 1930's, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago and a philosopher of education, had admitted academically superior 16-year-olds as freshmen. European universities had long allowed such acceleration.         What Mrs. Hall was doing was different in that she established a residential college expressly for high school aged students, putting it somewhere between a prep school and a college, with resultant tensions. For example, students complained about rules forbidding overnight room visits by members of the opposite sex.         There have been accusations over the years between the students and the administration as the college sought to find ways to restrict students' behavior without being harsh.         Mrs. Hall faced frequent criticism from both faculty and students. In an interview with Berkshire Week in 1988, she recalled that she fought against ''self-pity'' before resigning, partly as a result of such criticism, in 1972 . She remained a trustee.         Mrs. Hall's husband died in 1995. She is survived by her sons, Thomas Livingston Hall of San Francisco, and John Kendrick Hall of Jerusalem; her daughters, Margaret Hall Whitfield Courant of Great Barrington and Elizabeth Hall Richardson of Denver; 11 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.         Correction:  July 21, 2005, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, who founded Simon's Rock College, now part of Bard College, referred incorrectly in some copies to the given name of the president of Bard, who commented on her legacy. He is Leon Botstein, not Leo.       
         Franzi Groszmann, who was believed to be among the last survivors of the parents who put their London-bound children on trains to escape Nazi persecution, in the famed Kindertransport, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 100.         Deborah Oppenheimer, producer of the 2000 movie ''Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport,'' announced the death.         Ms. Oppenheimer, whose own mother was a Kindertransport child, said she believed that Mrs. Groszmann was the last surviving mother who had placed a child (the author Lore Segal) on a train from Germany, Austria or Czechoslovakia to seek safety in Britain.         The British government had eased immigration restrictions for children under 17 after the violent attack on Jews in Germany in November 1938 known as Kristallnacht, or Night of the Broken Glass.         ''In no time, the suitcase was gone, the child was gone, the other children were gone -- just emptiness,'' Mrs. Groszmann said in the film about watching Lore board the train in Vienna. ''I did not talk. It was awful.''         She relaxed only after she received a postcard from Lore in England saying she was safe.         Ms. Segal told about the Kindertransport (Children's Transport) in her autobiographical novel, ''Other People's Houses,'' drawing a loving portrait of a charming and capable mother. From Dec. 2, 1938, until May 14, 1940, 9,000 to 10,000 children, 7,500 of them Jewish, were sent to Britain.         Each was allowed only one suitcase and one backpack, and was known only by a number. Lore was 152.         The mother and daughter also appeared in Melissa Hacker's Academy Award-winning 1996 film ''My Knees Were Jumping.''         Mrs. Groszmann's husband and Lore's father was Ignatz, the chief accountant of a Vienna bank, who was fired after Hitler took over Austria. At that time Lore was their only child.         In later years, when Lore thought of boarding the train, she had ''no clear recollection'' of her father's being there. She wrote, ''Every time I looked toward them it was my mother's tiny face . . . that I saw smiling steadily toward me.''         In England, Lore met the first of five foster families; with none of them would she feel comfortable. In an interview with The Jewish Week in 2001, she said her mother wrote her: ''Be good. Be obedient. Be neat. Be tidy. Always be nice.''         On the instructions her father gave her before leaving, Lore wrote the Jewish refugee committee asking it to get her parents out of Austria, as well as her grandparents, aunt and twin cousins. Her request was granted, and her parents and the others emigrated to England.         But they found work as domestic servants and could not have children living with them. . She did not live with her relatives again until after the war, when she joined them in the Dominican Republic at the age of 21.         For a time, her father was interned on the Isle of Man as a German-speaking alien. He died in the final week of the war after suffering a series of strokes. Mrs. Groszmann and her daughter lived in a small flat while Lore attended Bedford College in London.         Ms. Segal and her mother and grandmother immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic in 1951 and lived together in a small apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Groszmann worked as a salad cook at Schrafft's and as a sales clerk at a Washington Heights bakery. After helping Lore with her first baby, she trained herself to become a nurse.         In addition to Ms. Segal, Mrs. Groszmann is survived by her brother, Paul Stern, two grandchildren and two great-grandsons.         For many years, Mrs. Groszmann and Ms. Segal lived in different apartments in the same building on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. Each day at 7 a.m., the daughter would take the elevator down to have breakfast with her mother, who until three years ago rose at dawn to squeeze grapefruit juice for the two of them.       
         Enid A. Haupt, whose philanthropy benefited libraries, museums and hospitals but who devoted much of her considerable fortune to creating public gardens and preserving horticultural institutions, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 99, and also kept a residence in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by her niece Cynthia Hazen Polsky.         Mrs. Haupt was fond of saying that ''nature is my religion.'' For more than five decades her greatest pleasure was sharing that religion.         A principal beneficiary of this passion was the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Over the years it received more than $34 million and will also receive a substantial gift from her estate. A major portion of her gift went to the resurrection of the garden's glass-domed Victorian conservatory, which by the 1970's had become a sodden and broken-paned ruin. The conservatory now bears her name.         ''People are refreshed, their minds are cleared, when they take a walk in a garden,'' she once said, explaining her interest in making public spaces beautiful. ''It's a marvelous escape from reality.''         Her other gifts were far-ranging and continuous. In the last 25 years alone they totaled more than $140 million, including $35 million to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She also endowed 10 faculty positions and had been an active member of the cancer center's Board of Overseers. Other beneficiaries included the Enid A. Haupt Garden at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, four acres of Victorian formal gardens, a section of which is entered through nine-foot-high moon gates, and another area with North African accents. In 1993, Mrs. Haupt donated 15 works of art, valued at more than $5 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, four years later, further works valued at $1.7 million, part of a total contribution of more than $13 million. A $1.5 million Haupt endowment maintains the gardens at the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan.         She also contributed $1 million to buy River Farm, a former home of George Washington in Alexandria, Va., for use as the national headquarters of the American Horticultural Society (with a stipulation that the 27 acres be open to the public). Another $1 million went to help the restoration of Bryant Park, adjoining the New York Public Library, once a haven for drug dealers and now a Midtown oasis. The library itself received more than $1.5 million, including $300,000 for a 1989 exhibition of flowers.         Mrs. Haupt's other important philanthropies included a multimillion-dollar gift to the Wildlife Conservation Society, some of which went to the restoration of Bronx Zoo Jungle World and some to an endowment fund for the project. She underwrote the Haupt Fountains on the Ellipse in Washington, between the White House and the Washington Monument. Other sizable contributions went to the restoration of the glass conservatory in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and to the Enid A. Haupt Library Annex of the Horticultural Society of New York. There were also gifts to the Monet garden in Giverny, France, and the National Wildflower Research Center in Austin, Tex. A gift of Édouard Vuillard's ''Place Vintimille'' to the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1998 was valued at $3.5 million.         A dreamer who was able to see many of her dreams take shape, she was also a realist, aware that even the best-laid plans require follow-up, and she devoted considerable time to the projects in which she took a particular interest. She was once asked how often the projects she supported ended up as she had visualized them. ''When they think I'll see it,'' she said.         Once committed to a project, she never wavered. When she wanted additional funds, she disposed of cherished possessions, seemingly without a qualm. Nineteen pieces from her collection of jewels brought more than $2 million at auction in the early 1970's. The money went immediately to her horticultural interests. In 1983, when she wanted $25 million to provide an ambulatory care center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she sold 15 of her French Impressionist paintings, including works by Gauguin, Cézanne, Renoir and van Gogh, to her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and former ambassador to Britain. He died in 2002.         Mrs. Haupt was the fourth, and last surviving, of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, the publisher who founded Triangle Publications, whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, The Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television stations. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom devoted much of their inherited wealth to public institutions.         Mrs. Haupt was married in 1936 to Ira Haupt, the founder and senior partner in a Wall Street securities concern, a marriage that lasted until Mr. Haupt's death in 1963. An earlier marriage to Norman Bensinger of Chicago, whom she had met while horseback riding, ended in divorce.         An intensely private woman -- Mrs. Haupt often wandered through the New York Botanical Garden when she felt there was little chance that she would be recognized -- she became less interested in the trappings of wealth as she grew older.         The gift that gave her the most satisfaction, she said, was one of her earliest and least heralded: the Enid A. Haupt Glass Garden, a playground for children who are patients at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University Medical Center. In 1959, she enveloped the playground, which was almost immediately nicknamed the Garden of Enid, in a greenhouse with soft music and made it a serene wheelchair-accessible haven for patients of every age and for staff members and visitors. Almost $1 million was donated for an endowment to maintain it.         Enid Annenberg was born in Chicago on May 13, 1906, and grew up in Milwaukee, where she attended the German-English Academy, now the University School. The family later moved to Manhattan and then to Long Island, but Enid was sent away to school at Mount Ida Seminary in Newton, Mass.         Although she was brought up at a time when careers for women from affluent families were not common, she was, she said, ''very adventurous and curious about everything and very different from my sisters.'' One of her first jobs was at The Philadelphia Inquirer, part of her father's publishing empire. During World War II, she wrote and broadcast for the Office of War Information, coining such phrases as ''If you can shell a pea, you can pack a parachute.''         In 1954, she became the publisher of Seventeen, the magazine for teenage girls, owned at the time by the Annenberg family. A year later, she became its editor, and for 15 years she directed the magazine from a pink swiveled throne in a large office dominated by pink curtains and pink flowers. During part of her tenure at the magazine, she also wrote a syndicated column, ''Young Living.''         She also wrote four books on young living and etiquette, with advice on how to meet boys and, once met, what to do about kissing. She recommended art exhibitions as a fine place to meet young men and once met, dropping a casual remark to capture their interest. Her suggestions of casual remarks included, ''What's chiaroscuro?'' and ''Picasso's Blue Period, I believe.''         If chiaroscuro or Picasso led to kissing, there was further advice: ''Kiss him lightly on the lips but don't go into a frantic clutch -- tilt your face ever so slightly so that the noses won't bump.''         Her serious collecting of Impressionist art began during her marriage to Mr. Haupt. ''My husband was also very interested and he supplied the money,'' she said.         She also made major gifts to museums. Six bronze sculptures by Giacometti, a sculpture by Henry Moore and a painting by Mark Rothko were among 13 pieces she gave to the National Gallery of Art in 1977.         She traced her interest in horticulture to a pot of huge purple orchids displayed in a friend's house in Milwaukee when she was a child. Much later, when a business associate of Mr. Haupt asked what she wanted as a wedding present, she said orchids, and orchids she got -- 13 tubs of cymbidiums from England.       
         Ruth Clement Bond, an educator and civic leader who in the mid-1930's, in her first and only foray into quilt design, helped transform the American quilt from a utilitarian bedcovering into a work of avant-garde social commentary, died on Oct. 24 at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Her death was confirmed by her family.         Mrs. Bond was noted for a series of quilts known collectively as the T.V.A. quilts. Designed by her, the quilts were sewn in rural Alabama by the wives of African-American workers building dams there for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Visually arresting and contemporary-looking even today, the T.V.A. quilts are considered pivotal in the history of American quiltmaking.         While most quilts of the period were based on the traditional geometric and floral designs that had endured for more than a century, the T.V.A. quilts are dynamic works of modern art. Using solid-colored fabrics appliquéd onto stark backgrounds, they depict bold, stylized silhouettes of black people. With their jagged yet elegant lines, the figures have been compared to the paper cutouts of Matisse and to the work of the Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.         Mrs. Bond, who had trained as an academic and did not know how to quilt, embarked on the project after her husband was sent to northern Alabama to supervise the black workers at the dam sites there. The Bonds lived for a time near the Wheeler Dam, in one of the segregated villages built for the workers and their families.         The women completed a half-dozen large quilts, all believed to have been made in 1934. Three are extant, as are several very small quilts, made as samples.         The T.V.A. quilts have been exhibited in New York at the Museum of Arts and Design, and elsewhere around the country. They are featured in several books, among them ''Soft Covers for Hard Times: Quiltmaking and the Great Depression'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1990), by Merikay Waldvogel.         In later years, Mrs. Bond, whose husband joined the Foreign Service in 1944, taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. After returning to Washington in the 1960's, she served as president of the African-American Women's Association.         In 1978, Mrs. Bond was part of a fact-finding mission for the National Council of Negro Women that studied the role of women in Senegal, Togo and the Ivory Coast.         Ruth Elizabeth Clement was born in Louisville, Ky., on May 22, 1904, the fourth of seven children of a prominent black family. Her father, George, was a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Her mother, the former Emma Williams, was, in 1946, the first black woman to be named American Mother of the Year.         Ruth received bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature from Northwestern University and was afterward the head of the English department at Kentucky State College.         In 1931, she married J. Max Bond and followed him to the University of Southern California, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. Mrs. Bond also started work on a Ph.D., but left after the birth of her first child. Mr. Bond later took a position with the T.V.A., becoming the highest-ranking black administrator there.         Mr. Bond died in 1991. Mrs. Bond is survived by their three children, Jane Clement Bond and J. Max Bond Jr., both of Manhattan, and George Clement Bond of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Emma Clement Walker, of Seattle; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         When Mrs. Bond joined her husband in Alabama, she planned to finish her doctoral studies, but there was no local university at which she could enroll. So, while her husband trained the builders, she went to work with their wives in the makeshift villages along the Tennessee River.         Many of the workers were former sharecroppers, and the dam project gave them their first real income. Almost overnight, their wives were buying pianos for their parlors. But to Mrs. Bond's consternation, they were wallpapering those parlors with the pages of the Sears catalog.         ''These country women were buying things they didn't need, yet weren't fixing up their houses,'' she said in 1992, in an oral history for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.         Mrs. Bond started a home beautification program, helping the women make curtains from dyed feed sacks and rugs from cornhusks. Many of the women were expert quilters, and she began designing pictorial quilts that celebrated black Americans' expanded opportunities under the New Deal. Mrs. Bond cut the pattern pieces out of paper and chose the colors; the women pieced and quilted the cotton fabric.         One quilt depicts a man torn between an alluring woman, tantalizingly glimpsed at one edge of the image, and a solid government job, represented by an extended uniformed arm, at the other.         Another shows a black fist seeming to rise straight from the earth. The fist clutches a jagged red lightning bolt, symbolizing the T.V.A.'s promise of rural electrification.         The women called the quilt ''Black Power.''       
         Sybil Shearer, an unpredictable individualist of modern dance, died on Thursday in Evanston, Ill. She was 93 and lived in Northbrook, Ill.         The cause was a stroke, said Toby Nicholson of the Morrison-Shearer Foundation and Museum.         A dancer of extraordinary agility, Ms. Shearer depicted both spiritual visions and human foibles. As the dance historian Margaret Lloyd wrote in ''The Borzoi Book of Modern Dance,'' ''Sybil Shearer is a perfectionist who likes to believe that perfection is humanly attainable.''         In her youth, she was sometimes compared to another experimental dancer, Merce Cunningham. When both gave separate programs at the American Dance Festival at Connecticut College in 1959, Doris Hering concluded in Dance Magazine: ''Both are mystics. Both move as though chosen by the wind.''         Ms. Shearer's first New York solo concert in 1941 attracted considerable attention, but less than two years later she abruptly abandoned what she considered the rat race of New York and settled in the Chicago suburbs. Making only sporadic returns to New York, she continued performing in the Chicago area and inspired dedicated students, among them John Neumeier, now the director of the Hamburg Ballet.         Ever idiosyncratic, Ms. Shearer rejected stage makeup and let her abundant reddish-brown hair hang loose during performances. She sometimes refused to take curtain calls and occasionally presented long evenings without intermissions.         Born in Toronto, Ms. Shearer grew up in Nyack, N.Y., and on Long Island. She studied ballet with various local teachers and acquired a virtuoso technique. The summer after she graduated from Skidmore College in 1934, she was drawn by a newfound interest in modern dance to Bennington College, then a center of modern-dance ferment.         At first, she specialized in solos. Some -- for instance, ''Let the Heavens Open That the Earth May Shine'' (1947) -- celebrated spiritual ideals. Others commented on earthly problems: ''In a Vacuum'' (1941) portrayed an assembly-line worker with physically demanding but unrelated movements that suggested dehumanization. Still other pieces were whimsical. ''Once Upon a Time'' (1951) was a suite of solos for fantastically named characters. Thus Medmiga was an ominous witch, Yanchi was fey, Relluckus was woebegone and Ziff fluttered aimlessly. Ms. Shearer once told the dancer Stuart Hodes that all these creatures ''live in my garden at home.'' Ms. Shearer also choreographed group works, among them ''Fables and Proverbs'' (1961) and ''The Reflection in the Puddle Is Mine'' (1963).         Many of her productions were close collaborations with Helen Morrison, a photographer, filmmaker and lighting designer who meticulously documented Ms. Shearer's career. The Morrison-Shearer Foundation and Museum maintains the Shearer archives. In recent years, Ms. Shearer became a dance writer; her criticism as Chicago correspondent for Ballet Review combined shrewd appraisals with evocative metaphors. The first volume of her autobiography, is to be published next year.         No immediate survivors are known.       
         Katharine Sergava, a dancer and actress who portrayed Laurey in Agnes de Mille's dream ballet in the original Broadway production of ''Oklahoma!,'' died on Nov. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 or 96.         Her death was reported yesterday by a longtime friend, Ann Berlin. An erroneous report of Ms. Sergava's death appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 4, 2003.         Ms. Sergava was born in Tiflis (now Tblisi) in Georgia on July 30, 1909 or 1910 (she gave both dates). She fled Russia with her family during the Revolution and settled for a time in London. She studied drama and ballet in London and Paris and later emigrated to the United States.         In New York, she danced with the Mordkin Ballet, Ballet Theater, now known as American Ballet Theater, and the Original Ballet Russe, as Col. W. de Basil's Ballet Russe then called itself.         She danced the part of Laurey from the opening of ''Oklahoma!'' in 1943 until 1947. She was then cast in ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing,'' choreographed by Jerome Robbins. In 1956, she took over Lotte Lenya's role in ''The Threepenny Opera.''         She also appeared in a variety of plays, including ''Dial M for Murder'' and Jean Cocteau's ''The Typewriter,'' and she toured in Shaw's ''Misalliance.'' She taught drama at HB Studios in New York for more than 30 years.         Her husband, Bernard Sznycer, died in 1970. She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Constance Keene, a pianist and teacher whose recordings of the Romantic keyboard repertory were highly regarded, died on Dec. 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84, and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by Debra Kinzler, the spokeswoman for the Manhattan School of Music, where Ms. Keene has taught since 1969. She also joined the school's board of trustees in 1997.         Ms. Keene maintained a fairly low-key performing career in recent years, but her influence as a teacher and occasional writer on keyboard topics for Clavier magazine was considerable. She was a juror at several major competitions, and in addition to her work at the Manhattan School, she gave master classes in Europe, Asia and South Africa.         Early in Ms. Keene's career, her playing was praised by Artur Rubinstein, who said that her recording of the Rachmaninoff Preludes left him ''completely flabbergasted by the fantastic sweep, color, tone and last but not least, by the incredible technique.'' When Rubinstein decided that his children were old enough to take piano lessons, he hired Ms. Keene as their teacher.         Ms. Keene was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 9, 1921, and began to play the piano when she was 4. She completed high school when she was 15 and never attended college or a conservatory. But in 1934, when she was 13, she became a student of Abram Chasins, the pianist, composer, writer and broadcaster. She and Chasins married in 1949, and performed and recorded together as a duo-piano team. Chasins died in 1987. Ms. Keene later married Milton Kean, who survives her.         In addition to her duet performances with Chasins, Ms. Keene pursued a solo career that was given a boost by her victory at the Naumburg Competition in 1943. She then spent the remaining years of World War II touring Army installations for the U.S.O. At one camp, in Mississippi, she played eight concerts in three days for 65,000 soldiers.         She undertook her first professional tour in 1945, and made headlines in 1946 when she substituted for Vladimir Horowitz at a recital for an audience of 4,000. In the several years that followed, she performed with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and toured with Benny Goodman, as the soloist in Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue.''         Her recordings included works of Bach, Handel, Griffes, MacDowell, Schumann, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Chasins, as well as widely praised recent discs devoted to the complete sontatas of Hummel and Weber.
