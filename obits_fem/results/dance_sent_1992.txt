Sound and Movement
        Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes.
She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915.
The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman.
She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance.
The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective.

" 'Living Essence'
        She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching.
A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp.
Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.
John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering.
" He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen.
" Early TV, Then Broadway
        Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary.
