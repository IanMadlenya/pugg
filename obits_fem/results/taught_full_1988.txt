        La Meri, the dancer, teacher, writer and dance ethnologist, died in a San Antonio hospital on Jan. 7. She was 89 years old.         La Meri, the dancer, teacher, writer and dance ethnologist, died in a San Antonio hospital on Jan. 7. She was 89 years old.         Described as ''the indisputed queen of ethnic dance'' by Walter Sorrell, the dance writer, La Meri was long considered the leading American authority on the subject, particularly the dance of India and Spain. She toured the world at the height of her career, in the 1920's and 30's, studying and performing in South and Central America, Europe, Scandinavia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Burma, Malaya, Java, the Philippines, China, Japan, Ceylon and Hawaii.         She founded the School of Natya with Ruth St. Denis in 1940 in New York, where she taught and performed with her company, the Five Natyas, and presented such guest lecturers as Pearl S. Buck, Coomaraswamy, Lin Yutang, Ted Shawn and Argentinita. Her book ''Spanish Dancing,'' published in 1948, was considered by many to be the definitive text on Spanish dance.         La Meri, whose real name was Russell Meriwether Hughes, was born in Louisville, Ky. She received her first dance training in San Antonio, where she studied ballet and Spanish and Mexican dance as a child. She later studied Hawaiian dancing in Hawaii and, in New York City, modern dance with Michio Ito and ballet with Aaron Tomaroff and Ivan Tarasoff. Dancing Before Movies         La Meri made her professional stage debut in 1924 in San Antonio, where she danced prologues to silent movies. In New York, she performed with Maria Montero and was a featured vaudeville performer with Keith Time and in the 1949 Broadway revue ''A Night in Spain.'' Her first major work was ''Krishna Gopala,'' presented in 1940 with St. Denis and Hadassah as guest artists. She also created an interpretation of ''Swan Lake'' in the Bharata Natyam school of Indian classical dance and created many dances in the styles of other cultures. ''An afternoon with Miss La Meri is rather like being shown a small corner of some connoisseur's collection of choreographiana,'' John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1940 in a review of one of La Meri's many New York appearances.         She taught and performed with her own company at the New York School of Natya, which was absorbed into the Ethnologic Dance Center she founded in 1942. The school continued until 1956 and was an important source of training in ethnic dancing. La Meri taught at universities across the nation. She also taught and performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and taught at the Juilliard School in New York. On her retirement in 1970, La Meri established Ethnic Dance Arts Inc. in Hyannis, Mass., where she presented an annual ethnic dance festival and awards.         La Meri wrote six volumes of poetry and five books on dance esthetics, technique and composition. Her extensive collection of material on ethnic dance, given to the New York Public Library in 1948 and 1962, is a major holding of the library's Dance Collection. In 1972, La Meri received the Capezio Award.

        Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Miss Somogi's early successes were at the New York City Opera, where she made her 1974 debut in ''The Mikado'' and ''La Traviata,'' thus becoming the company's first female conductor. Yet, the preponderance of her career was centered in Europe. Beginning in 1981, Miss Somogi became first Kapellmeister under Michael Gielen at the Frankfurt Opera and left there only last year with the departure of Mr. Gielen and the dismantling of his organization. Miss Somogi's last appearance was six months ago conducting ''Das Rheingold'' in Frankfurt.         She never returned to the New York stage after moving to West Germany. During her Frankfurt career, she presided over new productions of ''Il Turco in Italia,'' ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' ''Tales of Hoffmann'' and ''Das Rheingold.'' Miss Somogi's American appearances during her European years were confined to productions at the Tulsa Opera. Joined City Opera in '66         She joined the City Opera in 1966 as a rehearsal pianist, spending her summers as assistant conductor to Thomas Schippers at the Spoleto Festival in Italy. There were also purely instrumental conducting appearances with the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics and more opera with various regional companies across the United States.         At the time Miss Somogi was hired in Frankfurt, Mr. Gielen said: ''We took her because she was the best. Our orchestra has some old experienced hands who cannot be taught very much. Within five minutes she had them on the edge of their seats.''         Judith Somogi was born in Brooklyn of a Hungarian father and a Sicilian mother. She said she had gained valuable experience as a church organist and choir director in Lynbrook, L.I., and as a pianist, she went on earn two degrees at Juilliard. ''Conducting,'' Miss Somogi once said, ''is something you learn by doing.''         She is survived by her parents, Louis and Antonina, and by her sister, Jane, all of Lynbrook.

        Jeanne Behrend, a pianist and composer who specialized in American music, died March 20 after a long illness at the Logan East retirement community care center in Philadelphia. She was 76 years old.         Jeanne Behrend, a pianist and composer who specialized in American music, died March 20 after a long illness at the Logan East retirement community care center in Philadelphia. She was 76 years old.         Miss Behrend was born in Philadelphia and made her first public apperarance there at the age of 11. In 1934 she graduated from the city's Curtis Institute, where she studied piano with Josef Hofmann and composition with Rosario Scalero.         Her New York debut followed in 1937 at Carnegie Hall, with a program that included a piano sonata she had composed. Howard Taubman, writing in The New York Times, found fault with the sonata but praised her playing.         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, Miss Behrend pursued a considerable pianistic career, concentrating on the music of North and South America. Heitor Villa-Lobos, the Brazilian composer, called her ''a heroine of the Americas,'' and she played often in Latin American countries. In 1959 she founded and directed the Philadelphia Festival of Western Hemisphere Music, and in 1965 she was awarded the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross. Gave Up Composing         As a composer, Miss Behrend produced a variety of mostly small-scale pieces, only some of which were published. After giving up composition in the late 1940's, she explained that she felt opportunities for women in composing were too limiting.         Miss Behrend taught courses in American music and piano at a variety of institutions in Philadelphia as well as at the Juilliard School in New York. A Gottschalk expert, she edited a selection of his piano scores as well as his autobiography, ''Notes of a Pianist.''

        Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, the first woman to serve as a Federal district judge, died here Monday at the age of 93 after a stroke.         Judge Matthews was named to the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by President Truman in 1949. At the time of her nomination, she was a familiar figure in Washington as a lawyer for the National Women's Party and an active campaigner for women's rights.         Judge Matthews presided over a number of major trials, including the 1957 bribery trial of James R. Hoffa, then vice president of the teamsters' union, at which he was acquitted. Help From Friends in Senate         She recalled in an interview several years ago that her friendship with a number of senators had blunted opposition to the notion of a woman on the Federal bench. When her nomination was being considered, one of the judges on the district court, T. Alan Goldsborough, said publicly that while ''Mrs. Matthews would be a good judge,'' there was ''just one thing wrong: she's a woman.''         While Judge Goldsborough told her some years later that his opposition had been mistaken, she received an icy welcome from her fellow judges, who agreed among themselves to assign her all the ''long motions,'' the most technical and least rewarding part of the court's docket.         Judge Matthews never retired from the court. In 1968 she took senior status, permitting her to reduce her workload on the district court while also hearing occasional cases in other Federal courts in Washington. She sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. She continued hearing district court cases until five years ago.         Judge Matthews retained a strong sense of her own role as a pioneer, and never wavered in her commitment to expanding opportunities for women. In a 1985 interview with the Third Branch, a newsletter published by the Federal court system, she said she had always chosen women to be her law clerks.         ''The reason I always had women,'' she said, ''was because so often, when a woman makes good at something they always say that some man did it. So I just thought it would be better to have women. I wanted to show my confidence in women.''         Burnita Shelton decided as a young girl that she wanted to be a lawyer, although professional opportunities in the law were extremely limited for women. She was born Dec. 28, 1894, in Copiah County, Mississippi, where her father owned a plantation and served as clerk of the local chancery court. She often accompanied him to court. But while the family sent her brother to law school, she was sent to the Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati, where she studied voice and piano.         She was teaching piano when the United States entered World War I. Hoping to find a Government job that would enable her to go to law school at night, she moved to Washington, passed a Civil Service examination, and took a job with the Veterans Administration. She went to night school at National University Law School, which later became part of George Washington University.         After her graduation in 1919, Mrs. Matthews, now married to a lawyer, Percy A. Matthews, applied to the Veterans Administration for a job as a lawyer. When the agency told her that it would never hire a woman in the legal department, she opened her own law office. More Obstacles to Legal Career         There were other stumbling blocks as well. The local bar association refused to accept her application for membership, returning the check she had sent for membership dues. Judge Matthews included that check among the papers she donated to what is now the Burnita Shelton Matthews Collection at the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, at Radcliffe College.         Her activities on behalf of women's rights began in law school. In 1919, she was among several dozen women who regularly picketed the White House on Sundays on behalf of women's suffrage. ''You could carry a banner,'' she recalled in the 1985 interview, ''but if you spoke, you were arrested for speaking without a permit. So when they asked me why I was there, I didn't answer.''         After women got the vote in 1920, she shifted the focus of her activities. She became the lawyer for the National Woman's Party, which was trying to persuade state legislatures to lift legal barriers to women. Mrs. Matthews researched state laws and drafted proposed bills. The National Woman's Party owned the property across the street from the Capitol where the Supreme Court's building is now located. In the 1920's, when Chief Justice William Howard Taft proposed acquiring the land for the Court, she went to the Chief Justice's home to try to persuade him to look elsewhere. Her efforts failed, but she represented the party in the condemnation proceedings and won a generous settlement for it.         In the 1940's she also taught at the Washington College of Law, now part of American University. Upheld Right of Black Muslims         In 1949, President Truman named her to one of 20 new district judgeships that Congress had created to relieve a backlog in district court dockets. Among her rulings was one upholding the right of Black Muslims in the local prison to conduct religious services.         In a 1955 case, she refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer Paul Robeson, who was accused of being a member of the Communist Party and of supporting various pro-Communist activities, . Mr. Robeson's passport was withheld from 1950 to 1958 and was restored to him when, in a similar case, the Supreme Court ruled the State Department's action unconstitutional.         On the Court of Appeals, Judge Matthews ruled that the Social Security Administration could not cut off disability benefits without a hearing.         In 1984, President Reagan commended her for her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit.''         Her husband died in 1969. They had no children. Judge Matthews is survived by four sisters-in-law and 11 nieces and nephews. She will be buried in the family cemetery in Copiah County, Mississippi.       
        Douce Fleming Correa, founder of the Fleming School, died of cancer Wednesday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 years old. She founded the school, at 35 East 62d Street in Manhattan, in 1956 to provide a blend of American and French education. In fact, it was meant as an alternative to the Lycee Francais, where Mrs.         Douce Fleming Correa, founder of the Fleming School, died of cancer Wednesday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 years old. She founded the school, at 35 East 62d Street in Manhattan, in 1956 to provide a blend of American and French education. In fact, it was meant as an alternative to the Lycee Francais, where Mrs. Correa had taught mathematics and science for almost 30 years.         Born in St.-Martin in the French Antilles, Mrs. Correa graduated from the Ecole Universelle in Paris and earned a master's degree from New York University. In 1982, she was made a Commandeur of the Palmes Academiques, the highest French honor for educators.         Survivors are her son, Ray-Eric of Manhattan; three sisters, Dina Fleming Moreno, Lise Nunes and Nellie Engle, all of Miami, and a brother, Oger, of St.-Martin.       
        Cleo Hartwig, a sculptor whose works featuring animals, birds and other natural subjects were inspired by her childhood in rural Michigan, died of cancer of the pancreas yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Cleo Hartwig, a sculptor whose works featuring animals, birds and other natural subjects were inspired by her childhood in rural Michigan, died of cancer of the pancreas yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Hartwig's work is in the permanent collections of many American museums, including the National Academy of Design, the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.         Miss Hartwig, a petite woman who wore her hair in a trademark ponytail, was a sculpture instructor at the Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J., from 1945 to 1971 and had previously taught sculpture at Cooper Union. Her work was usually carved from wood or stone, and she was sculpturing until shortly before she died, said Renata Manasse Schwebel, a fellow sculptor and longtime friend.         She was known among her colleagues as a woman who shunned the limelight herself but was a fervid supporter of other artists' careers.         ''When you met her, you thought she was a very shy, little birdie of a person,'' Ms. Schwebel said. ''Underneath it, if you ever tried to change her mind, she was total stainless steel.''         Miss Hartwig studied at Western Michigan University, the Art Institute of Chicago and the International School of Art in Manhattan.         In 1951, she married Vincent Glinsky, a sculptor, who was a founding member of the Sculptors Guild in Manhattan. For many years they shared a studio on West 16th Street. Mr. Glinsky died in 1975.         Miss Hartwig was a director of the National Sculpture Society, and the society's annual exhibition last year included two of her works: ''Owlet,'' a 1969 work in white Tennessee marble, and ''Guinea Fowl,'' a bronze executed in 1986.

        Mildred Gillars, known during World War II as Axis Sally for her propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany, has died. She was 87.         Mildred Gillars, known during World War II as Axis Sally for her propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany, has died. She was 87.         Ms. Gillars, who died Saturday, had moved here after her release in 1961 from Federal prison, where she served 12 years after her conviction for treason.         In her trial in 1949, Ms. Gillars said she was born in Portland, Me., in 1900. She said she attended Ohio Wesleyan University but left before graduating and traveled to Germany, where she took a radio job in 1940.         ''Hello, gang,'' her broadcasts to Allied forces began. ''Throw down those little old guns and toddle off home. There's no getting the Germans down.''         After the war, American military officials found her living in cellars of bombed-out buildings in Berlin. She was returned to the United States in 1948 and charged with treason.         Ms. Gillars testified that she had fallen in love with a German Foreign Service officer who talked her into making the broadcasts.         She was convicted and sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison. She served 12 years at Alderson, W.Va. After her release, she moved to Columbus and taught music at a kindergarten.         There was no announcement of her death. A private funeral was held, said her attorney, James Sauer.         He knew of no surviving relatives.       
        Mildred E.

She was 87 years old and lived in Columbus.         Mildred E. Gillars, nicknamed Axis Sally by American soldiers in World War II for her Nazi propaganda radio broadcasts, died of cancer of the colon last Saturday at Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She was 87 years old and lived in Columbus.         An American living in Berlin, she broadcast programs in English to the Allied forces in Europe and North Africa, messages designed to heighten loneliness, fatigue and the futility of fighting Germany. After the war she was arrested and brought to the United States, where she was tried and imprisoned for treason.         Her trial in 1949 attracted enormous public attention, as much for the soap-opera quality of Miss Gillars's life as for her crime.         She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and was fined $10,000. After serving 12 years, she was released on parole from the Federal Reformatory for Women in Alderson, W.Va. She then taught music in the convent school of the Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus in Columbus. Release From Prison         Miss Gillars was born Mildred Elizabeth Sisk in Portland, Me., but she changed her name. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University from 1918 to 1922. After her release from prison, she returned to the university and graduated in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in speech.         Conflicting reports about her life abroad say that she studied piano in Dresden, modeled in Paris and was a dressmaker's assistant in Algiers and an English teacher in Berlin. She arrived in Berlin in 1934 and broadcast in English on the German radio before the war. Arrest in 1946         When she was arrested in 1946, Miss Gillars said she had moved to Germany to marry a German citizen, who later died. The man was Max Otto Koischwitz, a former professor at Hunter College in New York who was an official in the German Foreign Office.         At her trial, Miss Gillars fascinated the public and the press with her flamboyance and cool self-possession. She cut a theatrical figure in tight-fitting black dresses, long silver hair and a deep tan. She had scarlet lips and nails. Miss Gillars ''has the hair of Mother machree and she wears it in the manner of Rita Hayworth,'' Richard H. Rovere wrote in The New Yorker of Feb. 26, 1949.         She sent a frisson through the trial when she described her obsessive love affair with Mr. Koischwitz, who was married. The program she was convicted of participating in, ''Vision of Invasion,'' was written by her lover. It was broadcast on May 11, 1944, only weeks before the June 6 invasion of Normandy. Mr. Koischwitz was reported to have died in the Soviet capture of Berlin in the spring of 1945.         After the war, Miss Gillars was found roaming, hungry and homeless, near Frankfurt am Main, seeking to regain her American citizenship. At her trial, she was said to have renounced American citizenship while living in Germany and American officials reported that in 1941 she had refused repatriation.         In 1950, a Federal appeals court upheld her conviction. It noted in its ruling that she had received the highest salary of all broadcasters on German radio.         After prison, her life in Columbus was quiet and reclusive. She had an unlisted telephone number and her records at Ohio Wesleyan are sealed. She is survived by at least one half-sister, who asked not to be identified.

She is survived by two sisters, Meda Thetford of Eatontown, N.J., and Winifred Smith of Perryville, Md.       
        Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, having suffered a second stroke a month ago. She had a first stroke in 1984.         ''We shall miss her very much but she had been very ill for some time,'' Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said today.         In the 1970's and early 1980's, millions of dog owners in Britain and the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on the BBC television program ''Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way,'' which became widely syndicated in this country. Before long, loyal viewers were telling their dogs, ''Walkies!'' as her byword caught on. With Love and Breath         Her book, ''No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a bestseller in 1982.         She insisted that any dog could be trained and showed that they could be taught within minutes with ''tone of voice, telepathy and a little bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to breathe into its nose.         Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In 1980, she was ''flabbergasted'' to be named female television personality of the year in Britain.         ''She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr. Michael Woodhouse, said.         The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north of London.         The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knack with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice. Innkeeper for Man and Beast         She trained dogs as her three children were growing up, and at one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.         She made her first dog-training film, ''Love Me, Love My Dog,'' in 1955 using a Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theaters around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance sales of 25,000.         Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when the television program was running.         She once said that because of the television appearances, she could not go out in public without being asked for her advice.         The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going through passport control at a London airport, the inspector said: ''Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''

Mattie Rice Coney, a schoolteacher and civic leader in Indianapolis known as an advocate for the inner-city poor, died Friday at Cambridge Health Care Center, Indianapolis, after a long illness. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Coney, born in Gallatin, Tenn., grew up in Indianapolis, where she lived for the rest of her life. A graduate of Butler University, she taught in the Indianapolis public school system for 35 years, retiring in 1965.         She was active in a variety of neighborhood causes and, in 1964, with her husband, Elmo Cooney, founded a neighborhood group, Citizens Forum, to combat housing discrimination against blacks. The group disbanded in 1984 because of the Coneys' poor health. Mr. Coney died that year.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Adela Rogers St. Johns, the journalist, author and screenwriter, died yesterday morning in the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, Calif., her grandson, George St. Johns, said. She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         Adela Rogers St. Johns, the journalist, author and screenwriter, died yesterday morning in the South County Convalescent Hospital in Arroyo Grande, Calif., her grandson, George St. Johns, said. She was 94 years old and had lived in Arroyo Grande for several years.         As a journalist for Hearst and other publications, she wrote about such stories as the Leopold-Loeb murder trial, the abdication of Edward VIII, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and the trial of the kidnapper, Bruno Hauptmann.         She also wrote many articles for Photoplay magazine, becoming known as its ''Mother Confessor of Hollywood.''         Her screenwriting included two Tom Mix westerns, and her published fiction included short stories and serials for The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping and other magazines. Worked for Several Papers         The Hearst publications for which she worked over the years included The San Francisco Examiner, The Los Angeles Herald and The Chicago American. She also worked for the Hearst-owned International News Service.         Mel Durslag, another longtime writer for Hearst publications, said yesterday, ''She was a tough, hard newspaper woman, a figure from the old, roaring days of Hearst journalism, which no longer lives.''         Mrs. St. Johns was the daughter of a California criminal lawyer, and she spent much time in courtrooms in her youth. She wrote in a 1969 volume of memoirs, ''The Honeycomb,'' that what she did not learn at school she had ''learned from pimps, professional prostitutes, gamblers, bank robbers, poets, newspapermen, jury bribers, millionaire dipsomaniacs and murderers.'' Began Career in 1913         She was born in Los Angeles on May 20, 1894, the daughter of Earl Rogers and the former Harriet Belle Greene. She grew up mainly in Los Angeles, attending several schools, including Hollywood High School, and then traveled widely, with time out to study piano in Leipzig.         She began her newspaper career in 1913 as a reporter and feature writer with The San Francisco Examiner. She worked for The Los Angeles Herald from 1914 to 1918, The Chicago American in 1928 and The New York American in 1929.         Mary Pickford, Tom Mix, Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino were some of the celebrities she interviewed over the years.         Mrs. St. Johns's first short story, ''The Black Cat,'' was published in 1918. Her first novel, ''The Sky Rocket'' (1923) became a movie, and so did ''A Free Soul'' (1924) and ''A Single Standard'' (1925). Taught at Universities         She taught at the Graduate School of Journalism of the University of California at Los Angeles from 1950 to 1952, and at other universities over the years.         Her books included ''How to Write a Short Story'' (1952) and ''Affirmative Prayer in Action'' (1955), and ''Final Verdict,'' a biography of her father, in 1962.         Other magazines to which she contributed included McCall's, Ladies Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Reader's Digest.         Mrs. St. Johns was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Nixon in 1970.         Her 1914 marriage to William Ivan St. Johns ended in divorce in 1929, and so did her subsequent marriages, to Richard Hyland and to Francis P. O'Toole.         She is survived by a daughter, Elaine St. Johns of Arroyo Grande; two sons, McCullah St. Johns of Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Richard Rogers St. Johns of Los Angeles; 10 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.         Memorial services will be held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, Calif.

        Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         As Lois W., she was revered as ''the first lady of Al-Anon,'' and as a living reminder of the beginnings five decades ago of the Alcoholics Anonymous self-help movement.         Al-Anon members help one another and themselves to deal with personal problems by speaking about them -''sharing their experience, strength and hope,'' as they like to say - at group meetings. They also help each other on a one-to-one basis, and they read the movement's many inspirational pamphlets and books. Thousands of Groups Formed         An executive on the staff of the Al-Anon Family Group headquarters in Manhattan, where Mrs. Wilson's death was announced yesterday, said 30,000 groups - including several thousand Alateen groups for the teen-age children of alcoholics - are in operation.         The executive, who in accordance with Al-Anon policy declined to give her name, said more than 20,000 of the groups were in the United States and Canada, with groups in about 100 other nations. She estimated worldwide membership of Al-Anon at about 500,000.         In the 1930's, Mrs. Wilson - a spirited, small woman with lively brown eyes - stuck by her alcoholic husband, William G. Wilson, who had become a self-described ''hanger-on in Wall Street.'' She hoped he would manage to stop drinking for good.         Mr. Wilson did, and in 1935 he became a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of its groups flourished in the Wilsons' home, then an apartment at 182 Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Since those early days, Alcoholics Anonymous has grown to an international membership of more than 1.5 million. Known within that organization as Bill W., Mr. Wilson died in 1971. A Time of Discontent         After Alcoholics Anonymous was founded, Mrs. Wilson became discontented. ''It seemed I saw nothing of the man I had tried to help,'' she later recalled.         ''He was always with his A.A. cronies'' who helped him to resist alcohol, she said, adding that ''I guess I was jealous and resentful that these strangers had done for him what I could not do.''         A turning point for her came one day when, as she said, ''I threw my shoe at him as hard as I could.''         ''I was so ashamed of myself,'' she said, ''that I went out and walked around the block several times. I soon had to admit that I needed some therapy myself.''         Mrs. Wilson, who was not an alcoholic, began applying to herself the same self-help principles that her husband and his Alcoholics Anonymous friends were using.         ''I shared my experience with other relatives of alcoholics, and we began to hold informal meetings,'' she said. ''We did not discuss our alcoholic relatives, but tried to straighten out our own lives. This attitude became basic to Al-Anon.'' Two Separate Organizations         Though Al-Anon is in many ways patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous, the two organizations are organizationally separate. Both groups are self-supporting; they do not accept funds from nonmembers. Members of both groups are supposed to maintain anonymity in the news media - which is why Mrs. Wilson and her husband were widely known only by their first names.         Mrs. Wilson was said never to have voiced blanket condemnation of the drinking of alcoholic beverages, affirming that she opposed ''only the disease of alcoholism and the damage it does to a family.''         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a physician. She graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, worked in a Y.W.C.A. and taught school in Short Hills, N.J., before her marriage to Mr. Wilson in 1918. After her marriage she worked for a time as an occupational therapist, wrote magazine articles and worked as a Macy's sales clerk.         After Mrs. Wilson and other alcoholics' relatives began their meetings, similar self-help discussion groups for members of alcoholics' families were founded elsewhere in the United States during the 1940's. In 1951, Mrs. Wilson, along with a friend and Westchester County neighbor, Anne B., set up a central information center for these groups. The center was initially in her Westchester home. First Alateen Group         Not long afterward, the center moved into offices in Manhattan, and the movement took the name Al-Anon Family Groups. In 1957, the first Alateen self-help group was set up, in California, for young people with alcoholism in their families.         Mrs. Wilson remained active and prominent in Al-Anon into the 1980's, traveling on its behalf and appearing at and addressing Al-Anon gatherings. At the first international convention of Al-Anon, in 1985 in Montreal, an audience of 45,000 -members of Alcoholics Anonymous as well as Al-Anon - gave her a standing ovation.         Mrs. Wilson wrote an autobiography, ''Lois Remembers,'' first published in 1979.         There are no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements have not yet been set.

She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         E. Christine Secor, an educator long active in day care, died of cancer Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Secor, a graduate of Beloit College in Wisconsin and a student at Fordham University and the Bank Street College, was associated with the Day Care Council of New York for the last 15 years. She was director of a Fordham/Day Care Council program that trained people to run day-care centers. She also ran a Head Start program in Manhattan and taught at the Riverside Church nursery.         She is survived by her husband, Neale, who is director of the Seamen's Church Institute in Philadelphia; two sons, Jonathan and Thomas, both of Manhattan; a brother, Hedley G. Dimock, who lives in Ontario, and a sister, Dorothy Palfi of Michiana, Ind.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Miss Parish's best-known character is Amelia Bedelia, a literal-minded maid who cuts a mistake-prone swath through 11 books (which are illustrated by various artists). When told to help the children plant bulbs, she buys light bulbs. When told to weed the garden, she plants row upon row of big weeds. When her employers, Mr. and Mr. Rogers, ask her to stuff stockings for the neighbors' children, she wonders why they want stockings full of turkey stuffing, but she dutifully obeys. When she is asked to make a spongecake, she snips a sponge into small pieces and drops it into a cake. A Birthday Celebration         Amelia Bedelia has many redeeming qualities, of course, not the least of which is her naivete, and she is loved by her fictional employers. She is also loved by real schoolchildren, many of whom joined in a celebration this year of Amelia Bedelia's 25th birthday, sponsored jointly by Greenwillow Books, Harper & Row and Avon Books, her principal publishers.         Paulette C. Kaufmann, director of children's book marketing at William Morrow & Company, the publisher of Greenwillow, said that hundreds of bookstores and libraries were given mailboxes in which children were invited to submit birthday wishes. ''Since August,'' she said, ''the contents of those mailboxes have been arriving daily - thousands of letters and drawings from children who have read and loved books about Amelia Bedelia.'' From Teacher to Writer         Miss Parish was born in Manning, and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English. She taught school in Oklahoma, Kentucky and, for more than 15 years, at the Dalton School in Manhattan. It was while teaching third grade at the Dalton School that she published her first book, in 1961. Her first Amelia Bedelia book was published two years later.         Her other books include ''The Cats' Burglar,'' ''Dinosaur Time,'' ''The Ghosts of Cougar Island,'' ''Good Hunting Little Indian,'' ''Hermit Dan'' and ''Let's Be Early Settlers With Daniel Boone.''         Miss Parish had a lifelong interest in teaching children to read and study, and she was proud that her books were often used in schools. She returned to Manning in 1972, continuing to write and to speak to library associations and children's education groups.         She is survived by her brother, Stanley, of Manning. A funeral service is to be held today at 2 P.M. at the Presbyterian Church in Manning.       
        Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of ''Sybil,'' a best-selling book about a woman with multiple personalities, and ''Shoemaker,'' a portrait of a Philadelphia murderer, died of a heart attack yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of ''Sybil,'' a best-selling book about a woman with multiple personalities, and ''Shoemaker,'' a portrait of a Philadelphia murderer, died of a heart attack yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Miss Schreiber, a professor of English and speech at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, first gained renown with ''Sybil,'' her 1973 case study chronicling the life and psychoanalysis of a woman with 16 clinically distinct personalities. The book became a best seller and was turned into a two-part NBC television movie in 1976.         Because of her studies of the psychological origins of criminality, Miss Schreiber became interested in writing about Joseph Kallinger, a shoemaker who killed three people in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. She interviewed him in jail in 1976, saying that a book about the murderer would show that ''it's even more important to prevent the development of psychosis that leads to crime than to get tough with criminals after the event.''         Like ''Sybil,'' the new book by Miss Schreiber provoked considerable controversy. After ''Shoemaker'' was published in 1983, she was sued by the family of one of Kallinger's victims under a so-called Son of Sam law in New Jersey that required that money owed to a criminal or his representatives as a result of his crimes go to the victims. A Superior Court ruled that not only the 12.5 percent promised to Mr. Kallinger but also money earned by Miss Schreiber and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, be paid to the victim's family.         Publishers called the ruling a violation of First Amendment rights of free speech, and an appellate panel reversed the decision, ruling that the law applied only to payments received by the criminal.         Before teaching at John Jay College, Miss Schreiber taught for many years at the New School for Social Research and at Adelphi College. She specialized in children's speech and wrote a 1956 manual for parents called ''Your Child's Speech.'' She was a theater critic in the 1940's and later contributed to many magazines and published several short stories.         Miss Schreiber had no immediate survivors.       
        Alice Boney, a prominent dealer in Oriental art, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 87 years old.         Alice Boney, a prominent dealer in Oriental art, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 87 years old.         Miss Boney was self-taught, yet rose to become an adviser on Chinese and Japanese art to collectors and museums. ''The doyenne of Oriental art,'' a Hong Kong magazine, Orientations, called her in an article to appear later this month.         ''In the 65 years of her career, she did what few women in the world dared to do,'' the article said. ''She entered the male-dominated world of Oriental art and she prospered.''         Born in Philadelphia, Miss Boney inherited a trust fund from her grandfather. She moved to New York, where she met Ian Kleykamp, a Dutch art dealer. They married and opened a gallery on Fifth Avenue.         They brought a shipload of Chinese tomb sculptures from the Tang Dynasty (618 to 906 A.D.) to New York and mounted an exhibition of the art. In 1926, they exhibited contemporary Japanese paintings, then rarely seen in the United States. Helped Build Hoover's Collection         During the Depression, the gallery closed and Miss Boney divorced. She went into business for herself, selling art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Freer Gallery in Washington.         Miss Boney was instrumental in building President Herbert H. Hoover's porcelain collection of Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644 A.D.) and Manchu Dynasty (1644 to 1912 A.D.) objects.         During the 1940's and 1950's, she helped to organize exhibitions of art and furniture at the China Institute and elsewhere. ''She introduced leading Japanese artists and potters to America,'' said Amy Poster, the acting director of the Asian art department at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1958 Miss Boney went to Japan for six months and stayed for 16 years, returning annually to the United States to sell art.         ''She was the preeminent dealer in her field of Asian art and particularly Japanese art,'' Ms. Poster noted. ''She taught a younger generation of dealers, collectors and museum professionals a great deal about an esthetic that she understood very well.''         When Miss Boney returned to New York in 1974, she worked from her Park Avenue apartment. She greeted visitors dressed in a green silk robe and matching antique jade jewelry. The robe, a Japanese yukata, which is less formal than a kimono, was given to her by a sumo wrestler.         There are no survivors.
