A memorial service will be held at 10 A.M. Monday in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan for the Rev. Mother Ruth, founder and headmistress of St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's Episcopal day school. The Reverend Mother, who died Dec. 22 after a brief illness, was 89 years old.         The Reverend Mother, a native New Yorker, was born Ruth Elaine Younger. She entered the Canadian Sisterhood of St. John the Divine in Toronto and took her final vows in 1922. She was a graduate of St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto, and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education from Columbia University.         She and a colleague, Sister Edith Margaret, founded St. Hilda's School in Morningside Heights in 1950. It later became St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School, which offered coeducational academic training from nursery through the 12th grade. She was its headmistress until her retirement in 1985.         In 1952, she was elected the Reverend Mother of the Community of the Holy Spirit, an Episcopal religious order for women that she founded that year. Under her direction, the group also founded the Melrose School in Brewster, N.Y., and St. Cuthbert's Retreat House.

        Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Miss Yourcenar was a cosmopolitan, versatile woman of letters who wrote in her native French. To English-speaking readers, she was best known for her fiction, especially her 1951 novel ''Memoirs of Hadrian.'' Her other writings included essays, memoirs and plays.         On hearing of her death, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France said yesterday in Paris: ''French letters has just lost an exceptional woman. On the strength of a classical and rigorous style, Marguerite Yourcenar used a very personal tone to find, thanks to history, the occasion for a strong reflection on morality and power.'' 'Words Will Be Read Forever'         Roger W. Straus, the president and chief executive officer of Farrar Straus & Giroux, which has published works by Miss Yourcenar, said yesterday in a statement released at the Manhattan headquarters of the publishing house: ''Marguerite Yourcenar was without question or doubt one of the great writers of the 20th century. She is a great loss to the literary community, but her words will be read and remembered forever.''         Born in Brussels of a French father and Belgian mother, Miss Yourcenar grew up in France and traveled widely. On a visit to the United States early in World War II, she decided to stay when, as she once put it, ''the months stretched into years as the war didn't end.'' For the next decade she taught comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College. She acquired United States citizenship in 1947 but was later reinstated as a citizen of France.         ''I am rootless,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To steal from Hadrian, 'I am at home everywhere and nowhere.' ''         Her induction into the Academie Francaise in 1981 was an accolade that had been denied to Mme. de Stael, Colette and other illustrious Frenchwomen in the four-century history of that prestigious society of 40 ''immortals,'' the arbiters of French language and literature. 'Let Their Shadows Pass'         Commenting on her induction, Miss Yourcenar said: ''This uncertain, floating me, whose existence I myself dispute, here it is, surrounded, accompanied by an invisible troupe of women who perhaps should have received this honor long before, so that I am tempted to stand aside to let their shadows pass.''         She also said the academy was not to blame for not admitting women sooner. ''One cannot say,'' she said, ''that in French society, so impregnated with feminine influences, the academy has been a notable misogynist: it simply conformed to the custom that willingly placed a woman on a pedestal but did not permit itself to officially offer her a chair.''         Miss Yourcenar was respected as a classical scholar as well as a literary stylist. The Oxford University classicist Hugh Lloyd-Jones, writing in The New York Times Book Review in February 1985, praised her ''ornamental and melliflous French prose, studded with the literary allusions which come so easily to such a cultivated writer.'' Mixing Scholarship and Magic         Miss Yourcenar once said her writing had ''one foot in scholarship, the other in magic arts,'' and her interests were diverse.         Shortly before her death, in an interview with Jean-Pierre Corteggiani for the new quarterly Normal, Miss Yourcenar spoke of her views on literature:         ''The books I like best are those where there is intelligence, goodness and no injustice. They are very rare indeed. I think that the reason there is so much bad literature, or at least one of the reasons, is that the average person who sets out to be a writer goes around looking for subjects to write about, and editors have the effrontery to ask you: 'Could you not possibly write a novel about . . . or an essay on . . .,' to which I always reply that I never write anything I have not chosen myself.''         Her works ranged from ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' - an imaginary autobiography of the Roman emperor written as a letter to his grandson Marcus Aurelius - to a volume of stories, ''Oriental Tales'' (first published in 1938 in French), that drew on the folklore of medieval Japan and other cultures. Translated American Spirituals         She also wrote plays, poems and prose poems and translated into French the lyrics of American spirituals as well as works by such authors as James Baldwin, the modern Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, Henry James, Thomas Mann, Yukio Mishima and Virginia Woolf.         The Hadrian novel was widely considered Miss Yourcenar's magnum opus. The author Stephen Koch wrote in The Times Book Review in September 1985 that the work ''has riches for anyone interested in history, humanism or the psychology of power.'' When it was first published, he recalled, ''it was immediately incrusted with the mixed and marmoreal honor of being called a classic in its own time.''         Miss Yourcenar's criticism was praised by John Gross in The Times. Reviewing the English translation of her book ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi and Other Essays,'' Mr. Gross called her ''an outstanding critic'' and said the essays in the book were notably lucid and ''forceful, deeply pondered, the record of a full imaginative response.''         The rest of her work, which drew on her familiarity with several languages and literatures, remained less widely known until she was named to the Academie Francaise. In subsequent years, translations of her writing came out more frequently. Translations Are Published         In April, ''Two Lives and a Dream,'' a volume containing three stories by Miss Yourcenar, was published in an English translation by Walter Kaiser in collaboraton with the author.         The book had come out in 1982 in France, and the stories it contained were revisions of writing Miss Yourcenar did decades earlier. Farrar Straus & Giroux is to publish a paperback edition in April.         ''Mishima: a Vision of the Void,'' a short study by Miss Yourcenar of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, was published here in 1986.         Farrar Straus is also scheduled to publish a collection of essays and literary criticism next spring titled ''That Mighty Sculptor, Time.'' In addition, Farrar Straus is to publish three volumes of autobiography by Ms. Yourcenar, but no publication dates have been set.         The other books by Miss Yourcenar that have appeared in the United States in English translation include, in addition to ''Memoirs of Hadrian,'' ''Coup de Grace'' (1957), ''The Abyss'' (1976), ''Fires'' (1981), ''A Coin in Nine Hands'' (1982), ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi'' (1984), ''Alexis'' (1984) and ''Oriental Tales'' (1985). Read Racine at 8         Miss Yourcenar was born June 8, 1903, the only child of Michel de Crayencour and the former Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne. The name Yourcenar - which she assumed personally and professionally in the 1920's - is an imperfect anagram of the name Crayencour.         Her mother died when Marguerite was less than a month old, and she was educated, largely by tutors, under the direction of her father. As an 8-year-old, she was already reading the work of the 17th-century French dramatist Racine, and as a teen-ager she had two small books of verse published.         Then, as an independently wealthy young woman, she traveled widely, wrote essays, poems and fiction, and won praise as a novelist. In 1950, after settling in the United States, Miss Yourcenar and her American friend and companion, Grace Frick, bought the house in Northeast Harbor - on Mount Desert Island off the Maine coast -that became their longtime home. Miss Frick, who translated ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' and other works by Miss Yourcenar into English, died in 1979.         Miss Yourcenar was known to have prepared a tombstone for her eventual grave, complete up to the final two digits of the date of her death. In the interview with Normal, Miss Yourcenar said she had met a Frenchwoman who was horrified that she had even put the first two numbers of her death date on the marker. ''So she said 'but why should you not live to the year 2000?' I have absolutely no desire to live till the year 2000,'' Miss Yourcenar said. ''The year 2000 is not for me.''         Miss Yourcenar was awarded honorary degrees by Smith, Bowdoin and Colby colleges. She also won numerous European literary prizes, was decorated by the French and Belgian Governments and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the Academy of the French Language and Literature of Belgium.         There are no known survivors.

        Ann C. Mersereau, a Manhattan school district superintendent in the 1970's, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in Teaneck, N.J. She was 65 years old.         Ann C. Mersereau, a Manhattan school district superintendent in the 1970's, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in Teaneck, N.J. She was 65 years old.         Mrs. Mersereau, a 40-year veteran of the New York City school system, was superintendent for Community School District 1, on the Lower East Side, from 1974 to April 1975. She also was a teacher and principal in the district.         Later, Mrs. Mersereau was the city's central school district director of the Federal Title VII fund program established under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits job discrimination on the basis of sex, race or religion. The central school district encompasses 31 school districts in Brooklyn and Queens.         At her death, she was on leave as principal of Intermediate School 206 in the Bronx.         Mrs. Mersereau was a graduate of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, and she held a master's degree from New York University and a doctorate from Fordham University.

        Margaret Campbell, the chairwoman of the Washington Square Music Festival since 1956, died of a heart attack Sunday at University Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and had lived in lower Manhattan since 1922.         Margaret Campbell, the chairwoman of the Washington Square Music Festival since 1956, died of a heart attack Sunday at University Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and had lived in lower Manhattan since 1922.         ''I was brought up to believe that one should contribute to the community somehow,'' Mrs. Campbell said in an interview last year, ''and the Washington Square Music Festival is my baby.'' The festival, which presents free chamber-orchestra concerts in Washington Square Park every summer, was founded in 1953 by the violinist Alexander Schneider and the Washington Square Association.         ''Alexander Schneider suggested producing concerts in the square,'' Mrs. Campbell recalled last year. ''The idea worked, and then it fell to me to take it over. My husband asked me what I knew about music. Well, I didn't know very much, but I've learned a lot.'' In the festival's early days, Mrs. Campbell used to carry scrapbooks and petitions to local businesses and corporations to keep the festival solvent. In 1953, the entire budget was $1,300; last year's festival, which presented four concerts, had a budget of $30,000. A Grove Street Resident         Mrs. Campbell, known as Peggy, was born in Audubon, Iowa, in 1900. Her father, William Green, served as a United States Representative, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and, later, as a Federal judge.         Mrs. Campbell is survived by a daughter, Peggy Friedman, and two grandchildren, Matthew and Susannah Friedman, all of Manhattan.         There will be a memorial service Friday at 11 A.M. at Grace Episcopal Church, 801 Broadway, at 10th Street.       
        Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the         Maxine Sullivan, whose cool, precise and rhythmic singing of the Scottish folk song ''Loch Lomond'' in the late 1930's gave her an identity that remained with her throughout her career, died of heart failure Tuesday at Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Miss Sullivan, who had a busy career both in this country and abroad, gave her last performance March 22 at the Westport Arts Center in Westport, Conn. She entered the hospital April 1, where she suffered a seizure and went into a coma.         Miss Sullivan was born Marietta Williams in Homestead, Pa., on May 13, 1911. She shot to fame in 1937 when she recorded ''Loch Lomond'' in an arrangement by Claude Thornhill, the pianist, who led a small accompanying group on the recording. It was an immediate hit, and she followed it with a series of recordings of swinging folk songs, including ''Molly Malone,'' ''It Was a Lover and His Lass'' and ''If I Had a Ribbon Bow.''         Although singing folk songs appeared to be a novelty at that time, Miss Sullivan was doing it in the very earliest stages of her career, when she was singing at an after-hours club in Pittsburgh called the Benjamin Harrison Literary Society.         Two of her future husbands, the bassist John Kirby and the pianist Cliff Jackson both first heard her singing there.         One of her songs was a musical setting of Joyce Kilmer's poem ''Trees.''         ''I couldn't sing it straight,'' she explained. ''I had no choice but to swing it.'' Married in 1938         The success of ''Loch Lomond'' led to an engagement for her at the Onyx Club on 52d Street. There she sang with a small band led by Mr. Kirby that played in a light and airy style, once described as ''orchestrated finesse'' that was an ideal complement to Miss Sullivan's singing and to her manner when she sang, standing motionless, her chin tilted confidently upward and a slightly mischievous smile lighting her face.         She married Mr. Kirby in 1938 and later she and his band became the stars of a weekly NBC radio network series, ''Flow Gently Sweet Rhythm,'' a precedent-setting event for black performers.         In 1938 Miss Sullivan went from the Onyx Club to Hollywood to appear in the film ''Going Places,'' in which she and Louis Armstrong introduced ''Jeepers Creepers.'' The following year she appeared in a second film, ''St. Louis Blues,'' and also performed on Broadway with Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman in a jazz version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' called ''Swingin' the Dream,'' in which she sang ''Darn That Dream.''         During the 1940's she moved away from her early close association with folk songs, although until her death she could always respect - and respond to - requests for ''Loch Lomond.'' She developed a fresh repertory of standard pop songs such as ''I've Got the World on a String,'' ''Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'' and ''I Got a Right to Sing the Blues.'' Won Tony Award in 1979         In 1950, after her marriage to Mr. Kirby had ended in divorce, she married Mr. Jackson and temporarily retired from singing to raise her daughter, Paula. During these years she developed an interest in physical therapy and nursing and was active in local civic affairs in the Bronx. After Mr. Jackson's death in 1970, she founded the House That Jazz Built, a community center at 1312 Stebbins Avenue in the Bronx. Dedicated to Mr. Jackson, the center continues to serve young people through the efforts of senior citizens.         In 1979 she received a Tony award for her performance in ''My Old Friends,'' a musical on aging that was described by a reviewer for The New York Times as ''jolly yet touching.''         She is survived by her daughter, Paula Morris, and her son, Orville Williams.         A service will be held at 7 P.M. tomorrow at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street.

        Tanya Zolotoroff Nash, who retired in 1968 after 35 years as the executive director of the New York Society for the Deaf, died last Friday at the Interfaith Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Tanya Zolotoroff Nash, who retired in 1968 after 35 years as the executive director of the New York Society for the Deaf, died last Friday at the Interfaith Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The society in 1974 dedicated its new community residence on East 13th Street in honor of Mrs. Nash and her long service to the deaf. The residence was named Tanya Towers. The 132-unit high-rise building near Avenue B is a home for the elderly, about half of whom are deaf.         Born in the Ukraine, Mrs. Nash immigrated to Brooklyn as a child. She became involved with the Society for the Welfare of the Jewish Deaf in 1929 when her husband, Rabbi A. Felix Nash, became its director.         Mrs. Nash was a social worker and Rabbi Nash was equally involved in that field. They learned sign language from deaf people at the society. Humble Origins         Mrs. Nash worked for many years as an interpreter for deaf people at religious services on Ellis Island as well as for deaf patients in state mental hospitals and psychiatrists' offices.         In 1932, after Rabbi Nash's death, Mrs. Nash was asked to take over leadership of the society in a caretaker role, but she soon was appointed executive director. Under her stewardship, the society provided a social setting for deaf people and helped them in such practical matters as finding jobs.         The society, founded in 1911, changed its name to the Jewish Society for the Deaf in 1951. It assumed its present, nonsectarian identity 15 years later.         At the opening Tanya Towers, Mrs. Nash spoke of the poverty her relatives faced when they arrived in this country in 1904. She recalled that when she won a citywide spelling contest at the age of 13, she was unable to attend the award ceremony because her shoes were in tatters.         Mrs. Nash is survived by her sister, Ruth Schreiber, and a niece, Julia Mallach, both of Manhattan.         A memorial service will be held at a date to be announced.       
        Emma DeLong Mills, a founder and former president of the Chinatown Planning Council and a leader of Chinese medical, educational and cultural institutions for more than 60 years, died of pneumonia Wednesday at the Southport Manor Convalescent Hospital in Southport, Conn. Miss Mills, who had lived most of her life in Manhattan, was 92 years old.         Emma DeLong Mills, a founder and former president of the Chinatown Planning Council and a leader of Chinese medical, educational and cultural institutions for more than 60 years, died of pneumonia Wednesday at the Southport Manor Convalescent Hospital in Southport, Conn. Miss Mills, who had lived most of her life in Manhattan, was 92 years old.         From 1965 to 1984, Miss Mills was a director and officer of the Chinatown Planning Council, a nonprofit multiservice agency serving New York's growing Chinese community. In 1968 she served as the Council's president.         Her interest in China stemmed from her friendship with Mei-ling Soong, a classmate at Wellesley College, who was later known as Madame Chiang, the wife of Chiang Kai-shek, the late president of Nationalist China.         Miss Mills traveled in China after her graduation from Wellesley in 1917, worked on the editorial staff of the Shanghai Gazette and also tutored in China.         In the 1930's, after the Japanese invasion, she raised funds for the war-torn country. After World War II, she assisted in the education of young Chinese in the United States.         Over the years, she served as an official of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the Hong Kong True Light School Foundation and the American-China Policy Association.         Miss Mills, who was born in Stamford, Conn., was an Army Nurse and a ''farmerette,'' a member of a corps of young women working on farms, in World War I. In World War II she was employed in the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.         She is survived by a cousin, Thomas A. DeLong of Southport.

She was 80 years old.         Miss Monroe, the official soloist for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spent much of her career singing the national anthem. She once estimated that she had sung it more than 5,000 times. In 1940 she starred in ''The American Jubilee'' at the New York World's Fair, closing each of 650 performances with the anthem. She sang for Presidents Roosevelt, Johnson and Kennedy, at President Truman's inauguration and at hundreds of other civic and patriotic gatherings.         In 1942, she conducted a community sing, sponsored by the Treasury Department, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. More than 40,000 people attended. During the next four years the Treasury and RCA Victor co-sponsored similar events nationwide to sell war bonds. Anthem Sometimes Barred         On some occasions, however, Miss Monroe refused to sing the song with which she had become so closely identified. When she performed for American troops, she did not sing the national anthem because, she said, ''the men are living it.''         Miss Monroe, who was born on Oct. 23, 1906, in New York, was the daughter of Anna Laughlin and Dwight Monroe, a diamond importer. She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School.         During the 1930's she was featured on three commercial radio programs a week and was a co-star for four years with Frank Munn on NBC's ''American Album of Familiar Music.'' She also appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras and with the Chicago, St. Louis and Metropolitan Opera companies.         Miss Monroe married Harold M. Weinberg, a New York lawyer, in 1961, and was widowed in 1977. She leaves no survivors.         A memorial service will be held at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets.

Madeleine Carroll, the cosmopolitan actress of the 1930's and 1940's who starred in the Alfred Hitchcock classics ''The 39 Steps'' and ''Secret Agent'' and more than three dozen other movies, died yesterday afternoon at her home outside the resort town of Marbella, Spain, a spokesman for the Marbella Hospital Clinic said. She was 81 years old.         The hospital spokesman said she died of natural causes, but did not give a cause of death.         A friend and neighbor of Miss Carroll, Countess Maria Larisch, said that the actress had been released from the Hospital Clinic a few days ago after spending more than two weeks there. Other members of the Marbella foreign community said that Miss Carroll, who became a United States citizen in 1943, had lived in the Mediterranean coast town for more than 15 years.         The actress, whose real name was Marie-Madeleine Bernadette O'Carroll, was born on Feb. 26, 1906, in West Bromwich, an industrial community five miles northwest of Birmingham, England. She was the daughter of John Carroll of Ireland and Helene de Rosiere Tuaillon, a Frenchwoman. Modeled Hats and Taught French         Miss Carroll was graduated from Birmingham University with a B.A. degree with honors in French. Her first jobs were modeling hats and teaching French. She made her acting debut as a French maid with a touring company in England. After a screen test, she got roles in several British movies, beginning with three 1928 films, ''The Guns of Loos,'' ''The First Born'' and ''What Money Can Buy.''         A delicate blonde beauty, Miss Carroll appeared in a score of British movies, with leading roles in ''The 39 Steps'' (1935) and ''Secret Agent'' (1936). In 1936, too, she went to Hollywood, where she was put under contract to Walter Wanger and 20th Century-Fox.         In the United States she appeared in ''The Case Against Mrs. Ames'' (1936), ''The General Died at Dawn'' (1936), ''Lloyd's of London'' (1936), ''On the Avenue'' (1937), ''The Prisoner of Zenda'' (1937), ''It's All Yours'' (1937), ''Blockade'' (1938), Cafe Society'' (1939), ''Honeymoon in Bali'' (1939), ''My Son, My Son,'' (1940), ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940) ''Virginia'' (1941), ''One Night in Lisbon,'' (1941), ''Bahama Passage'' (1942), and ''My Favorite Blonde'' (1942). Relief Work in World War II         During World War II, her sister was killed in a German air raid on London, and Miss Carroll went back to England, where she did war-relief work.         After the war she resumed her film career briefly, appearing in ''White Cradle Inn'' (1946), ''An Innocent Affair'' - also entitled ''Don't Trust Your Husband'' (1948), and ''The Fan'' (1949) before retiring from film work for good. She later appeared on the stage and on television and worked for Unesco.         During her long career she also acted in radio dramas and on the stage in the United States.         Miss Carroll's four marriages, to Capt. Philip Astley, the actor Sterling Hayden, Henri Lavorel and Andrew Heiskell, an executive of Time Inc., ended in divorce.
