         Janice Farrar Thaddeus, a scholar, poet, editor and former Harvard lecturer in English, died on Dec. 23 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 68.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Patrick Thaddeus.         In ''When Women Look at Men'' (Harper & Row), the feminist anthology Dr. Thaddeus edited in 1963 with John A. Kouwenhoven, she and her co-editor provided an answer to the question why women do not achieve as much as men in the professions: ''They have no wives.''         Dr. Thaddeus also wrote scholarly articles on Jonathan Swift, Richard Wright and Anthony Burgess.         She wrote a biography, ''Frances Burney: A Literary Life'' (St. Martin's, 2000), about a writer who had been considered a minor novelist of manners even though she was admired by Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Jane Austen and Edward Gibbon.         Janice Farrar Thaddeus was born in New York City on July 20, 1933, into a family immersed in the literary world. Her father, John Chipman Farrar, was editor of The Bookman in the 1920's and a founder in 1946 with Roger Straus Jr. of the publishing house Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Her mother, Margaret Petherbridge Farrar, was the first crossword puzzle editor of The New York Times.         Dr. Thaddeus received a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1955 and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1965. In 1986 she became a lecturer in history and literature at Harvard. She retired in 1999.         In addition to her husband, an astrophysicist at Harvard and at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Dr. Thaddeus is survived by a daughter, Eva Thaddeus of Albuquerque; a son, Michael Thaddeus of Manhattan; a sister, Alison Wilson of Palo Alto, Calif.; and a brother, Curtis Farrar of Washington.       
         Eileen Heckart, the actress with a smoky voice and toothsome smile who won an Oscar for ''Butterflies Are Free,'' three Emmys and a special lifetime achievement Tony, died on Monday at her home in Norwalk, Conn. She was 82.         The cause was cancer, her son Mark said.         One of those ubiquitous actresses who always seemed to be working, Ms. Heckart was perhaps most widely known for her television appearances as Mary Richards's Aunt Flo on the Mary Tyler Moore show, for example, or more recently for her recurring role of the mother of the lawyer James Wyler in the ABC drama ''Murder One.''         Her best-remembered film roles include the mother of Rocky Graziano in ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' (1956) Marilyn Monroe's waitress friend in ''Bus Stop'' (also 1956) and the overbearing mother of the blind boy in ''Butterflies Are Free,'' for which she won the Academy Award as best supporting actress in 1972.         But the actress often said in interviews that her heart belonged to the stage and that was where she performed the bulk of her work.         She played her share of drinkers --  like the spinster teacher in ''Picnic'' in 1953 and the alcoholic mother whose son drowns in ''The Bad Seed'' in 1955, both on Broadway.         Most recently, in 2000, she played Gladys Green, the lead in ''The Waverly Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's empathetic study of an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease.         Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called her performance ''uncanny'' and praised her  ''beautifully coherent and intelligent portrayal of a woman sliding into incoherence.''         The actress was born Anna Eileen Heckart in Columbus, Ohio, on March 29, 1919.         Her parents separated when she was 2. Her father, Leo Herbert Heckart, took her younger brother to live with him, she said, but she remained with her mother, Esther, who was married five times.         Ms. Heckart graduated in 1942 from Ohio State University in Columbus, where she she caught whooping cough, which resulted in the deepening of her voice.         After graduation, she married her college sweetheart, John Harrison Yankee Jr., who became an insurance broker. The couple had three sons, Mark, of Norwalk; Philip, of Stratford, Conn.; and Luke, of Los Angeles, all of whom survive her, along with two half-sisters and Mark's two daughters.         Ms. Heckart began her career in summer stock, came to New York and cut her teeth in live television -- -- ''The Alcoa Hour,'' ''The Philco Television Playhouse,'' ''Goodyear Television Playhouse'' and ''Playhouse 90.''         Her first break onstage came in William Inge's ''Picnic,'' when she was 33. She played a schoolteacher with, as Brooks Atkinson put it in The New York Times, ''a hunger for life and a knack for getting it.''         She made her Broadway debut in 1943 as understudy and assistant stage manager for ''The Voice of the Turtle.''         After ''Picnic'' came ''The Bad Seed.'' Then ''Butterflies are Free'' on Broadway with Keir Dullea and Blythe Danner, in which she played Mr. Dullea's mother.         In 1965, she created the role of the disapproving mother in the Broadway production of ''Barefoot in the Park,'' while also appearing in episodes of television series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''The FBI.''         The PBS productions ''Save Me a Place at Forest Lawn'' and ''The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,'' both in 1966, won Ms. Heckart a host of television awards.         Among her other plays were ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs,'' ''Our Town,'' ''They Knew What They Wanted,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''Mother Courage'' and ''Time of the Cuckoo.''         During a decade of absence from the New York stage, she toured in national companies of Broadway hits, acted in movies and won roles in four separate television series that were picked up and then dropped. The last of these was ''Annie McGuire,'' in 1988, in which Ms. Heckart played Mary Tyler Moore's mother.         When she returned to the theater in the 1989 production of Lee Blessing's play, ''Eleemosynary,'' the Times theater critic Frank Rich welcomed her back.         ''There are some absent friends you don't realize how much you've been missing until they suddenly pop up again,'' he wrote.         ''Ms. Heckart is what one might describe as a long actress,'' Mr. Rich continued, ''long of face, of torso, of tongue. There is mischief in her big glistening eyes. And when she speaks, it is in the low, crystalline, merry rasp of a wise aunt who has seen and understood everything (perhaps with cigarette in hand), relished most of it and can't wait for the next adventure.''         Ms. Heckart smoked up until her death and blamed her friend Bette Davis for her addiction. ''I went to a hypnotist and managed to stop smoking for six months,'' Ms. Heckart recalled in a 1989 interview with The Times. ''Then I appeared in 'Burnt Offerings' with Bette. Well, she smoked all day, and then she asked me to dinner. Pretty soon, I asked her for just one cigarette. Then I had another. And then I was a smoker again.''         In 1997, Ms. Heckart's husband died suddenly on his morning walk. ''I looked out the window and he was gone,'' she told The Times in April 2000. ''It was the worst year of my life.'' The two had been married for 53 years.         She was awarded a special Tony in 2000 for her lifetime of theater work.         In another Times interview Ms. Heckart said her current role in ''The Waverly Gallery'' was her best, except perhaps for her part in ''Mother Courage.''         She also said it would be her last. ''This is my swan song, my last performance in a play,'' she said. ''It just takes too much energy.''         Speaking of her role, she added,  ''You get such a good one, you may as well go out on a wave.''         Correction:  January 4, 2002, Friday  An obituary of the actress Eileen Heckart on Wednesday referred incorrectly to her Broadway appearance as the mother (Mrs. Banks) in ''Barefoot in the Park.'' She did not create the role; she succeeded Mildred Natwick. The article also misstated the number of Emmy Awards she received. It was two, not three.       
         Bibi Osterwald, an actress in theater, television and films, died on Jan. 2 in Burbank, Calif. She was 83 and lived in Burbank.         Ms. Osterwald appeared in Broadway shows that included the original production of ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ''Bus Stop'' ''Look Homeward, Angel'' and ''The Golden Apple,'' for which she received an Outer Circle Critics Award in 1953.         She was the understudy for the title role in ''Hello, Dolly!'' for seven years, and she played the part 122 times, filling in for Ginger Rogers, Betty Grable, Phyllis Diller, Martha Raye, Ethel Merman and others.         During the 1980's she played the role of Maggie Jones in the national company of ''42nd Street.''         Ms. Osterwald's television work dated back to the 1940's, and included ''Front Row Center,'' ''The Imogene Coca Show,'' ''Naked City'' and ''As the World Turns.'' During the 1970's and 80's she made frequent guest appearances as a genial, grandmotherly character on shows like ''The Love Boat,'' ''Three's Company,'' ''St. Elsewhere'' and ''Newhart.''         Her film credits included ''Parrish,'' ''A Fine Madness'' and ''As Good as It Gets.''         Ms. Osterwald, whose original first name was Margaret, was born in New Brunswick, N.J., and lived most of her life in New York.         She is survived by her husband, Justin Arndt; a son, Christopher Arndt, of San Clemente, Calif.; and two granddaughters.       
         Naomi Bliven, a writer at The New Yorker for more than 40 years, died on Monday in New York, where she lived. She was 76.         She had lymphoma and had recently had a stroke. Ms. Bliven, who had been contributing to The New Yorker since the late 1950's and became a staff writer in 1961, wrote feature articles and ''Talk of the Town'' items, but she is best remembered as a perceptive and prolific book critic. She wrote more than 200 long reviews and thousands of shorter items for the magazine's ''Briefly Noted'' column.         Alice Truax, her most recent editor, said that at her peak Ms. Bliven wrote four reviews a week and probably contributed more than 2,000 reviews to the magazine. She said Ms. Bliven hungrily went through the weekly stack of books that the magazine sent her and if she was not satisfied with them, she went to a bookstore over the weekend to get more.         She remained productive to the end of her life. Her last review, of Beryl Bainbridge's ''According to Queeney,'' a historical novel about the circle surrounding Samuel Johnson, was published in the magazine's July 30, 2001, issue.         Ms. Bliven was born Naomi Horowitz in New York and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College. She worked at Random House, and her first credited article in The New Yorker ran in 1958.         She also wrote a novel, ''On Her Own,'' which was published by Grove Press in 1989.         From 1978 to 1996, Ms. Bliven held various offices, including secretary and vice president, at PEN, the national organization of writers and editors.         She was married to Bruce Bliven Jr., a writer and historian, who died on Jan. 2.         She is survived by a son, Frederic, of Manahattan; a brother, Daniel Horowitz, of Washington; and two nieces.       
         Charity Adams Earley, the commander of the only all-black Women's Army Corps unit to serve overseas during World War II, died on Jan. 13 in Dayton, Ohio, long her hometown. She was 83.         At a time when a segregated military provided few opportunities for blacks, Charity Adams was one of only two to hold a wartime rank in the Wacs as high as major. A subsequent promotion made her a lieutenant colonel briefly before she left military service in 1946.         The Army first permitted black members of the Wacs to serve overseas in the winter of 1945, when it created the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-black unit,  and assigned some 850 African-American women to it. The unit, based in Birmingham, England, and later in Rouen, France, and Paris,  routed mail -- much of it backed up at English warehouses in the chaos that followed the Battle of the Bulge -- to millions of members of the armed forces in Europe.         The assignment of Major Adams as the battalion commander seemed a natural choice. Having grown up in Columbia, S.C. -- her father a minister in the A.M.E. Church, her mother  a teacher -- she had graduated from Wilberforce University in Ohio and was studying for a master's degree at Ohio State when she joined the  Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, the forerunner of the Wacs, in 1942. She was among 39 black women in the corps's first training class, at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, and became one of its first black officers. She then held administrative and command positions at Fort Des Moines for two and a half years.         From her first day in the corps, though, she had to bear the humiliations of a segregated military. Though she had forged a quick camaraderie with white officer candidates who had ridden with her by train to Fort Des Moines, the bond did not survive once they reached their destination.         ''The Army soon shattered whatever closeness we had felt,'' she recalled in her memoir, ''One Woman's Army'' (Texas A&M Press, 1989). ''When we left the mess hall we were marched two-by-two's to the reception center. A young, red-haired second lieutenant said, 'Will all the colored girls move over on this side.' He pointed to an isolated group of seats.         ''There was a moment of stunned silence, for even in the United States of the 40's it did not occur to us that this could happen. The integration of our trip did not prepare us for this. What made things worse was that even after the 'colored girls' had been pushed to the side, all the rest of the women were called by name to join a group to be led to their quarters. Why could not the 'colored girls' be called by name to go to their quarters rather than be isolated by race?''         The members of the 6888th postal unit were the first black women many Britons in Birmingham had ever seen, and they shattered stereotypes.         ''These Wacs are very different from the colored women portrayed on the films, where they are usually either domestics or the outspoken old-retainer type or sloe-eyed sirens given to gaudiness of costume and eccentricity in dress,'' The Birmingham Sunday Mercury said. ''The  Wacs have dignity and proper reserve.''         That dignity was tested by both the Army and the Red Cross.         Major Adams recalled in her memoir that when a general inspecting her battalion was told that not all the women would be present, since some were working and others sleeping after a night shift, he responded, ''I'm going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit.''         Major Adams replied, ''Over my dead body, sir.''         The general threatened to court-martial Major Adams for that remark, and she, in turn, prepared to file charges against him for disobeying a directive from Allied headquarters to refrain from language stressing racial segregation. The matter was dropped by both sides, and the general later told Major Adams he had come to respect her.         While in England, Major Adams refused equipment from the Red Cross for a segregated recreational center -- the battalion had been permitted use of the same recreational area used by whites -- and persuaded members of the unit not to stay at a segregated Red Cross hotel in London while on leave.         After her military service, she received a master's degree in vocational psychology from Ohio State, then became a dean at Tennessee A&I  College and Georgia State College. The Smithsonian Institution has included her in its listing of the historically most important black women.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Stanley Earley Jr., a physician whom she wed after the war; a son,  Stanley III; a daughter, Judith Earley; two brothers, Senior Bishop John Adams of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and E. Avery Adams; and a sister, Dr. Lucy Rose Adams.         In 1996, Mrs. Earley was honored at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum for her wartime service.  Before leaving Dayton for the ceremony in Washington, she said: ''When I talk to students, they say, 'How did it feel to know you were making history?' But you don't know you're making history when it's happening. I just wanted to do my job.''       
         Edith Bouvier Beale, once a successful model and aspiring actress who later lived a gothic life in Grey Gardens, a dilapidated 28-room house in East Hampton, N.Y., with her mother and dozens of cats, raccoons and opossums, was found dead in her small apartment in Bal Harbour, Fla., on Jan. 14. She was 84.         Her nephew, Bouvier Beale, said the Dade County coroner attributed the death to a heart attack or stroke resulting from arteriosclerosis. Her cousin, John H. Davis, said she appeared to have been dead for five days.         The two Beale women, an aunt and a cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, became famous when their peculiar living situation was shown in the documentary film ''Grey Gardens,'' made by Albert and David Maysles in 1975. The once-elegant grounds were a tangled jungle; 25 rooms were unused, and the fleas were so thick that the filmmakers wore flea collars around their ankles during the filming.         At one point in the film, Ms. Beale's mother, who had the same name (they were publicly known as Big Edie and Little Edie), laughs when a cat relieves itself behind a youthful portrait of her propped against a bedroom wall.         But the loving but embittered relationship between the two women is perhaps the most compelling theme of the film. In it, the daughter has returned to care for her mother, and repeatedly suggests that life has passed her by as a result. The mother's manner is forcefully controlling.         ''You've had enough fun in your life,'' she tells her daughter, who never stops protesting that she wants to move to New York or Paris.         As young Edie empties a box of cat biscuits for the raccoons in the attic, she says, ''I've been a subterranean prisoner here for 20 years.''         The film drew both rave reviews and hard questions about the invasion of privacy inherent in the Maysleses' trademark technique of using a hand-held camera to capture lives uncomfortably close up. It also provoked comparisons to the memory plays of Tennessee Williams.         ''It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, awfully difficult,'' Little Edie laments in the film.         A startling side effect of the movie has been the continuing interest of the fashion world in the costumes she is shown wearing, including a contrived skirt held over her ample thighs by a pin. She said the skirt could double as a cape.         Italian Vogue and Harper's Bazaar have done photographic layouts of fashions inspired by the movie. Calvin Klein was a fan of the film, and Greta Garbo was said to have been.         Edith Bouvier Beale was born in Manhattan on Nov. 7, 1917. She was the eldest of the 10 grandchildren of John Vernou Bouvier Jr., who spent summers at the family estate in East Hampton, Lasata. Another of the grandchildren was Jacqueline Bouvier, the future first lady.         Mr. Davis, another grandchild and author of ''Bouviers: Portrait of an American Family'' (Farrar, Straus, 1969), said Edie was the family beauty, ''surpassing even the dark charm of Jacqueline.''         Her father was Phelan Beale, a Wall Street lawyer, who raised three children at Grey Gardens on Lily Pond Lane. Her two brothers are dead, and she left no immediate survivors.         The parents' marriage ended in divorce, and Mr. Beale's second wife inherited his estate. Edith, the mother, also incurred the wrath of her father, Major Bouvier, by showing up at the wedding of her son dressed like an opera star, just as the ceremony ended. Two days later, her father cut her out of his will.         She eventually received a $65,000 trust fund, and retained the house her husband gave her in 1923.         Ms. Beale lived a gilded life as a youth. In 1936, The New York Times reported on her debut, at which she wore a gown of white net appliquéd in silver and a wreath of gardenias in her hair.         Starting at 17, she began a successful career as a model. She felt that she was on the verge of a big break into films in 1952, when she was 35. She said she had offers from MGM and Paramount, and that her dance career was set to take off. She also said that wealthy men like Howard Hughes and J. Paul Getty had asked her to marry them.         ''She had a very, very fertile imagination,'' Mr. Davis cautioned.         Whether on the verge of success or not, she was called home to Grey Gardens by her mother, who said she was ill and needed her.         Over the years, things deteriorated. On Oct. 22, 1971, inspectors from the Suffolk County Health Department raided the house and discovered that it violated every known building regulation. In the dining room, they found a five-foot mountain of empty cans; in the upstairs bedrooms, they saw human waste.         The story became a national scandal. Health Department officials said they would evict the women unless the house was cleaned. Mrs. Onassis came to the rescue, paying for a cleanup that included 40 gallons of germicide.         Lee Radziwill, sister of Mrs. Onassis, introduced the Maysleses to her relatives as part of a project she had proposed to film the early years of her and her sister's lives. Though that idea was abandoned, the filmmakers returned to the Beales to suggest a film about them.         The elder Edith Beale died in 1977. Her daughter flirted briefly with a singing career and stayed in Grey Gardens for two years before selling it.         Ms. Beale spent more and more of her time in Florida, where she swam every day. She lived off her small savings.         She had not owned a cat in five years.       
         Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish writer whose rollicking, anarchic books about Pippi Longstocking rattled some tradition-bound Swedes when they first appeared almost 60 years ago but came to captivate millions of children around the world, died yesterday at her home in Stockholm. She was 94.         Mrs. Lindgren, who began publishing in the 1940's, became one of the world's most widely translated authors. In addition to being a beloved cultural figure in Sweden, she was also a powerful political force, successfully lobbying on issues like tax reform and improved conditions for farm animals.         Although Mrs. Lindgren produced more than 70 books for young people, she was best known as the author of the classic ''Pippi Longstocking,'' first published in Sweden in 1945 and in the United States five years later. The title character is a 9-year-old carrot-haired enfant terrible who lives cheerfully by herself in the ramshackle Villa Villekulla and befriends her better behaved, better groomed neighbors, Tommy and Annika.         ''She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy,'' the book begins.         ''Pippi'' and its sequels have together sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. The sheer subversive quality of the books, whose brazen young heroine does exactly as she pleases, made them unusual for juvenile literature.         ''Bertrand Russell has written that a child dreams about power as grown-ups dream sexual wish dreams,'' Mrs. Lindgren said in a 1985 interview. ''This is a child who has power. That is wonderful, for children to think, 'Oh, if I were like Pippi! I could say to Father, '' 'You don't do that!' ''         ''She has power, but she never misuses that power,'' Ms. Lindgren said, ''which I think is the most splendid thing, and the most difficult.''         Mrs. Lindgren was born Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson on Nov. 14, 1907, the second of four children of Samuel August and Hanna Jonsson Ericsson, in Vimmerby, in southern Sweden. Her father was a tenant farmer, and Mrs. Lindgren grew up outside Vimmerby at Nas, a 500-year-old farm, in an old red house surrounded by apple orchards.         ''Rocks and trees were as close to us as living beings, and nature protected and nurtured our playing and our dreaming,'' she wrote in a 1973 memoir. ''Whatever our imagination could call forth was enacted in the land around us -- all fairy tales, all adventures we invented or read about or heard about, all of it happened there, and only there. Even our songs and prayers had their places in surrounding nature.''         The pastoral idyll of Mrs. Lindgren's youth came to an end in 1926, when, 19 and unmarried, she became pregnant. She fled to Copenhagen, where she gave birth to a son, Lars, and later settled in Stockholm.         To support herself, she took a secretarial job at the Royal Automobile Club in Stockholm. (Among Mrs. Lindgren's lesser known writing is the 1939 work ''Twenty-Five Automobile Tours in Sweden.'') In 1931 she married a co-worker, Sture Lindgren. Mrs. Lindgren, who was widowed in 1952, is survived by a sister, Stina Hergin; her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         It was Karin who first conjured up Pippi. In 1941 when she was 7 she was sick in bed with pneumonia. Night after night she nagged her mother to tell her a story.         ''What should I tell?'' the exhausted Mrs. Lindgren asked one evening.         ''Tell about Pippi Langstrump'' -- Pippi Longstocking -- Karin replied, coining the name on the spot.         Her mother gamely complied.         ''I didn't ask her who Pippi Longstocking was,'' Mrs. Lindgren told The New Yorker in 1983. ''I just began the story, and since it was a strange name it turned out to be a strange girl as well.''         Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's daughter Longstocking was indeed a strange girl. Her fiery hair stuck straight out from either side of her head in two tight braids. She wore one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. Her mother was long dead; her sailor father had been lost at sea, though Pippi was confident he had come ashore on a South Sea island where ''he had become king of all the cannibals.'' She had a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nilsson for company and a trunkful of gold pieces to provide for her wants.         Like many heroes of traditional Scandinavian lore, Pippi was fearless, ageless and endowed with superhuman strength.         But above all, Pippi was rude:  deeply, outrageously, satisfyingly rude. Invited to a fancy coffee party, she devoured an entire cream cake before the assembled guests.         The sequel ''Pippi Goes on Board'' was published in Sweden in 1946, followed by ''Pippi in the South Seas'' in 1948, ''Pippi on the Run'' in 1971 and several other Pippi stories not translated into English.         In the 1970's she stepped into public life to protest Sweden's income tax laws, which sent self-employed artists like Mrs. Lindgren and the director Ingmar Bergman reeling under a staggering tax burden. A lifelong supporter of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Mrs. Lindgren published a caustic newspaper satire before the 1976 election in which she calculated that, because of competing local and federal taxes, her income was taxed at an annual rate of 102 percent. The Social Democrats, in power for more than 40 years, were defeated, and tax cuts followed, events Mrs. Lindgren was sometimes credited with bringing about.         Although Mrs. Lindgren's career made her wealthy, she continued to live modestly in the same Stockholm apartment where ''Pippi Longstocking'' was first written, rising early to write in bed before going off to her editing job. She regarded her status as one of Sweden's best loved celebrities with characteristic quiet humor.         ''Perhaps this is because in Stockholm drunks come up and hug me all the time,'' she said in 1994. ''And I cannot be that impressed with anyone, except for God.''       
         Inge Morath, a photographer who brought a whimsical, lyrical touch to her images from travelogues to reportage to portraits, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Roxbury, Conn.         Arthur Miller, her husband, said the cause of death was lymphoma.         ''She made poetry out of people and their places over half a century,'' Mr. Miller said.         Her work included striking portraits of both posed celebrities and fleeting images of anonymous passers-by. Her feeling for places as reflected in images of Boris Pasternak's home, Chekhov's house and Mao Zedong's bedroom was so sensitive that some viewers insisted they could see invisible people.         But many critics said the pictures spoke eloquently for themselves.         ''Inge Morath possesses the priceless quality of making the world look as though it had been discovered only this morning and she was present with her lens to record its bright freshness,'' Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the couple's book ''In Russia'' (Viking, 1969).         In the later phases of her long career, Ms. Morath produced books with her husband: he provided words and she the pictures. Beyond their respective artistic talents, the books were enhanced by his easy access to top figures in culture and other fields and her great facility with languages. For example, she spent years learning Chinese before the couple tackled China.         In an essay in The New York Times concerning their book ''In the Country'' (Viking, 1977), Mr. Miller suggested such collaborations allowed the two to play with notions of time. ''As always, the camera sees the past -- all it can see -- and here it speaks of a symmetry of action and thought and a revolution based on empirical common sense, when in truth these people watch the television news for the event on Wall Street, in Washington or Korea that will affect the price of fertilizer and crops,'' he wrote. ''The surreal emerges from the fragility of what camera and mind can grasp as real.''         Inge Mörath (with umlaut over the o) was born on May 27, 1923, in Graz, Austria. (She lost the umlaut somewhere in her international career.) Her parents, both scientists, were well off and brought her up in their liberal Protestant tradition. They moved frequently, and were living in Berlin at the outbreak of World War II.         She was drafted to work in an airplane factory with Ukrainian prisoners of war after she declined to be a Nazi supporter. The factory was regularly bombed; after one bombing, she remembered running through the streets of the devastated city holding a bouquet of lilacs above her head. In an interview with Joyce Wadler that appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1998, she recalled walking through the countryside and witnessing the horror of war.         ''Everyone was dead or half dead,'' she said. ''I walked by dead horses, by women with dead babies in their arms. I can't photograph war for this reason.''         After the war, she used the language expertise she had honed at the University of Berlin to translate for occupying Americans, and then to work as Austrian editor of an American government-controlled magazine. She began to write articles to accompany the photographs of Ernst Haas, and was invited to Paris by Robert Capa with Mr. Haas to serve as an editor of the just-founded Magnum agency.         She began photographing in London in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson as a researcher in 1953 and 1954. In 1955, after working two years as a photographer, she became a member of Magnum, which functions as a cooperative.         Her many foreign assignments included a trip to Iran for Holiday magazine in 1956; there she wore the traditional chador and traveled alone most of the time.         In the late 1950's she saved Audie Murphy, the actor and war hero, from drowning when he was in Mexico making a movie ''The Unforgiven.'' Ms. Morath jumped into a cold mountain lake in her underwear, swam a half-mile and dragged Mr. Murphy back by her bra strap -- at least in her telling.         Other notable assignments included shooting the stills in London for John Huston's film ''Moulin Rouge'' (1952), in which she had to make do with three rolls of color film because it was so scarce at the time. She developed a lifelong friendship with Mr. Huston, something she often did with her subjects. ''Photography is essentially a personal matter, a search for inner truth,'' she said.         In 1960, she was photographing the filming of ''The Misfits'' in Reno, Nev. One of the stars was Marilyn Monroe, who was accompanied by her husband at that time, Mr. Miller. She took a famous image of the two together: Mr. Miller, with his cigarette, Monroe leaning out the window with her back turned.         But she said that it was difficult to get them close enough together to photograph. The marriage soon broke up; Ms. Morath married Mr. Miller in 1962, and they had one child, Rebecca, who lives in Manhattan. Rebecca has one son.         Ms. Morath -- who practiced yoga, swam daily and was a vegetarian -- continued to photograph until two weeks ago. Elliott Erwitt, a veteran photographer for Magnum, remembered her as a wonderful hostess. ''It was kind of a permanent salon that she managed beautifully,'' he said. ''She was at ease in any situation.''       
         Margaret Loeb Kempner, a philanthropist whose special concerns included the well-being of children, families with children and the elderly, died on Dec. 31 at her home in Purchase, N.Y. She was 102.         In 1999, when Mrs. Kempner had her 100th birthday, she was made an honorary director of The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, a Manhattan hospital with which she had ties for five decades.         Her father was Carl M. Loeb, former president of the American Metal Company and co-founder with his son John Langeloth Loeb of Carl M. Loeb & Company, later to become known as the Wall Street firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         The Loeb family gave the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park to New York City.         Mrs. Kempner and her husband, Alan H., gave money and time to the Kempner Rare Book Library at Columbia University.         Another beneficiary of her philanthropy and fund-raising was the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. She was chairman of the board of its women's division and became a lifetime trustee of its successor organization, the UJA-Federation of New York.         She assisted Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., for almost seven decades, raising money and serving on its board. She played the same roles at The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.         Born in St. Louis, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated in 1917 from the the Horace Mann School for Girls, which closed in 1946.         She married Mr. Kempner in 1920. He died in 1985.         Surviving are two sons, Alan Jr. of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Thomas, of Manhattan; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Montant, a former editor in chief of Gourmet magazine who prized passionate writing, died on Jan. 1 in her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         She had Parkinson's disease, emphysema and liver cancer, her son, Jon Carson of Boston, said.         She was editor in chief from 1980 to 1991, when she retired. During her tenure, Gourmet's circulation rose to 895,000 from 671,000.         At that time, Gourmet was the acknowledged leader among food magazines, but considered itself a lifestyle magazine for the affluent rather than just a food publication. For example, the number of articles about foreign travel grew steeply while she was in charge, along with revenue from travel advertisements. She found veteran cooks who could create and test recipes. She also had a knack for learning about and attracting talented writers and photographers to the magazine.         She began at Gourmet in 1953, answering mail from readers, and rose to be the magazine's executive editor from the early 1960's to 1980. For years, beginning in the 1960's, she largely set the magazine's look, style and content. The writers she attracted included James Beard, Joseph Wechsberg and Richard Condon.         ''Finding writers was easy,'' she told an interviewer once. ''I always looked for people who had passion. In the end it's the only thing that matters.''         She was born Jane Smallwood in Boston and grew up mostly in Manhattan. She graduated from the Todhunter School, a private school for girls in Manhattan.         Her 1945 marriage to Phil Montant ended in divorce.       
         Virginia Hamilton, an internationally recognized writer for children whose work celebrated the African-American experience as an essential component of American life, died yesterday in Dayton, Ohio. She was 65 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.         The cause was breast cancer, said Kris Moran, director of publicity for Scholastic, Ms. Hamilton's publisher.         Ms. Hamilton, known privately by her married name, Virginia Hamilton Adoff, wrote more than 35 books in many genres that spanned picture books and folk stories, mysteries and science fiction, realistic novels and biography. Among her best-known works are ''The People Could Fly'' (1985), ''The Planet of Junior Brown'' (1971) and ''Many Thousand Gone: African Americans From Slavery to Freedom'' (1993).         She won a National Book Award in 1975 for her novel ''M. C. Higgins, the Great''; the book also received a Newbery award, the first to a black writer. In 1995 she became the first children's author to receive a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant.         Woven into her books is a deep concern with memory, tradition and generational legacy, especially as they helped define the lives of American blacks from the days of slavery onward. Ms. Hamilton described her work as ''liberation literature.''         Virginia Esther Hamilton was born March 12, 1936. She grew up on the small farm in Yellow Springs that had been her family's since the 1850's;  she later returned there with her husband and children.         She came from a family of storytellers. Ms. Hamilton's grandfather Levi Perry was born a slave in Virginia and crossed the Ohio River to freedom. Once a year, she wrote, he gathered his children around him. ''Set down,'' he would say, ''and I will tell you about slavery and why I ran, so that it will never happen to you.'' Ms. Hamilton was named Virginia in remembrance of his flight.         After attending Antioch College and Ohio State University -- she lacked the money to complete her studies -- Ms. Hamilton moved to New York. There, while studying writing at the New School for Social Research, she met the poet Arnold Adoff, whom she married in 1960. Mr. Adoff survives her, as do two sisters, Nina Anthony, of Columbus, Ohio, and Barbara Davis, of Los Angeles; two brothers, William Hamilton, of Englewood, N.J., and Kenneth James Hamilton Jr., of Chula Vista, Calif.; a daughter, Leigh Hamilton Adoff, of Berlin, and a son, Jaime Levi Adoff, of Manhattan.         Ms. Hamilton's first book, ''Zeely,'' appeared in 1967. At the time the few children's books about black people were mainly ''problem'' novels, which threw into sharp relief issues like segregation and poverty.         ''Zeely'' was a radical departure. It was not that race was absent, but that it was so completely, unremarkably present. Ms. Hamilton forsook gritty urban drama for a pastoral tale of enchantment whose characters happened to be black. The novel told the story of a girl who, during a summer on her uncle's farm, is captivated by an enigmatic local woman she believes is a Watusi queen.         Among Ms. Hamilton's many honors were an Edgar Allan Poe Award, a Coretta Scott King Award, a Hans Christian Andersen Medal and an honorary doctorate from Ohio State.         Many of her recent books were devoted to the black oral tradition; she combed dusty archives for early manuscripts with long-forgotten songs, riddles and stories.         The fruits of her travels included ''The People Could Fly,'' which retells slaves' traditional tales in an accessible vernacular, without the ugly misspellings historically used to render black dialect. The title story recounts: ''The one called Driver cracked his whip over the slow ones to make them move faster. That whip was a slice-open cut of pain. So they did move faster. Had to.''         The book's carefully worded subtitle, ''American Black Folktales,'' was itself a political statement, Ms. Hamilton later recalled. Her editor had urged on her the more conventional  ''Black American Folktales.''         ''No,'' Ms. Hamilton replied. ''They're American first and black second.''       
         Elisabeth Luce Moore, who was active in many philanthropic and educational organizations, died on Feb. 9 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         She was a sister of the publisher Henry R. Luce, who died in 1967.         Mrs. Moore retired in 1999 after 63 years on the board of the Henry Luce Foundation, which finances projects in Asian affairs and other fields.         The organizations in which Mrs. Moore served included Wellesley College, her alma mater, and the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia.         She was the first woman to serve as board chairman of the State University of New York. She was chairman of the National Council of the U.S.O. during World War II, and a member of the Advisory Committee to the Marshall Plan.         Her husband, Maurice T. Moore, a partner in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, died in 1986. She is survived by a son, Michael Moore of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.       
         Annalee Whitmore Fadiman, a screenwriter, World War II correspondent and the author, with Theodore H. White, of the best seller ''Thunder Out of China,'' died yesterday in Captiva, Fla. She was 85.         Mrs. Fadiman, who as a member of the Hemlock Society supported a right to suicide, took her own life, said her daughter, Anne. Mrs. Fadiman had been suffering from breast cancer and Parkinson's disease.         A woman successful in several careers, Mrs. Fadiman spent much of her life defying the conventions of professions dominated by men. Nancy Sorel, in her book ''The Women Who Wrote the War,'' called Mrs. Fadiman's career ''a real-life movie.'' Sidney Skolsky, the 1940's Hollywood columnist, called her ''the girl reporter of this war.''         Annalee Whitmore was born on May 27, 1916, on the kitchen table of her family's home in Price, Utah, the eldest of four children born to Leland Whitmore, a bank president who built and flew airplanes as a hobby, and Anne Sharp Whitmore, who later became a librarian at the main branch of the New York Public Library.         When Mr. Whitmore lost his job during the Depression, the family  moved to California and struggled to make ends meet. Ms. Whitmore attended Piedmont High School and was admitted to Stanford University in 1933 after scoring highest in the state on a college entrance exam.  She graduated in 1937, having served as the first woman to be managing editor of the Stanford Daily newspaper.         She took a $75-a-month secretarial job at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in San Francisco, but quit after a year when her boss asked her to type part of the manuscript of a memoir he had written.         In 1938, she moved to Los Angeles and joined the secretarial pool at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When she heard that MGM needed a film to occupy Judy Garland between ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms,'' she wrote a treatment in a single weekend and became the co-writer of ''Andy Hardy Meets Debutante''(1940), with Garland and Mickey Rooney.         With several more screenplay credits, she was offered a seven-year contract by MGM, but she dreamed of reporting in China, where war was already raging. The War Department allowed no female correspondents in China at that time, so in 1941 she landed a job as the Far East representative of a relief agency. Once in Chungking, writing speeches for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, she won a reporting job with Liberty magazine.         She married Melville Jacoby, a Time magazine correspondent she had first met when they were both Stanford undergraduates. Keeping barely a step ahead of the advancing Japanese forces after Pearl Harbor, they eventually withdrew to Brisbane, Australia. Mr. Jacoby was killed at 25 in an airfield accident near Darwin.         In 1944, Theodore H. White, the Time correspondent (he had been a close friend of Mr. Jacoby), finally persuaded his boss, Henry Luce, to seek War Department accreditation for Ms. Whitmore, so that she could join Mr. White in Chungking. She collaborated with him on ''Thunder Out of China,'' about China's role in the war, the strengths and weaknesses of the Kuomintang and the Communists, and the country's future. The book is still in print.         After the war, Ms. Whitmore wrote articles, lectured widely and appeared on the radio quiz show ''Information Please,'' where she met her second husband, Clifton Fadiman, the program's M.C. and the book reviewer for The New Yorker.         They were married in 1950, and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, of Massachusetts; a son, Kim, of Wyoming; a sister, Carol Whitmore of California; and two grandchildren. Mr. Fadiman died in 1999.       
         Suzanne Bloch, a musician and teacher who spurred interest in early music through her performances on the lute and other instruments, and who promoted the music of her father, Ernest Bloch, died on Jan. 29 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 94.         In frequent concerts beginning in the late 1930's, Ms. Bloch spread news of the lute, the delicate ancestor of the guitar that was common in Europe into the 18th century but by the 20th had become obscure. She also played the recorder and the virginal, a tiny cousin of the harpsichord, and lectured on Renaissance music at her concerts and in her classes at the Juilliard School, where she taught from 1942 to 1985.         Her concerts were intimate affairs, attempting to recreate the music in its original, private environments. She often dressed in Renaissance costumes, which she made, and never let microphones alter the quiet, ghostly sound of the old instruments, even when she played in a place as large as Town Hall in Manhattan.         The music she played and sang included many works that she unearthed during her frequent research missions through European libraries and conservatories.         Ms. Bloch was born in Geneva in 1907 and moved with her family to New York in 1916, when her father began a series of conducting and teaching posts in American cities. She moved to Paris in 1925 to study music with Nadia Boulanger, and it was at an early-music concert there that she first heard the lute. ''I saw lutes being played,'' she recalled in 1987, ''but they were so soft I couldn't hear them.'' She was entranced.         During the next decade she studied music in Paris and Berlin, and in England in 1933 she met a lute expert, Arnold Dolmetsch, who sold her an instrument from 1600 that he had restored. In 1935 she performed at the Hazelmere Festival in England, and soon moved to New York and began her concert career.         She was largely self-taught in ancient instruments, and she pursued the field with a determination that was partly due to a rivalry with her father, said her son Anthony Smith. ''She wanted to be a composer, but her father put her down,'' he said. ''She wanted a career where her father couldn't criticize her.''         In 1935 she married Paul Smith, a mathematics student at Harvard who had an interest in recorders and early music. He became the chairman of the mathematics department at Columbia, and in New York and Princeton, N.J., Ms. Bloch often played chamber music with prominent scientists. One participant was Albert Einstein, who sometimes irritated the other musicians by not coming in on the beat. ''He couldn't count,'' Ms. Bloch once said.         She was the leading authority on  her father's music, and promoted it  worldwide. She would often write the program notes to concerts of his music, collected voluminous clippings about him and began, but never finished, a biography. She also founded the Ernest Bloch Society in 1967, which has held the Bay Music Festival devoted to his music every summer since 1990, in Newport, Ore. (Ernest Bloch lived on the Oregon shore from 1941 until his death in 1959.)         In addition to Anthony, of Oakland, Calif., Ms. Bloch is survived by another son, Matthew, of Manhattan,  and a grandson, Strider, of San Francisco.       
         Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, whose troubled private life aroused both worldwide sympathy and widespread reprobation, died yesterday morning in London. She was 71.         She suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon, the latest in a series that had left her partly paralyzed in recent months, and developed heart problems overnight, Buckingham Palace said.         The queen announced the death ''with great sadness,'' according to a statement from the palace.         Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is touring West Africa, said he was ''deeply saddened.''         Attractive and fun-loving, Princess Margaret earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit. But her 20's were clouded by an unlucky romance with Group Capt. Peter Townsend of the Royal Air Force, a Battle of Britain hero with whom she fell in love when he served as an equerry to her father, King George VI.         A Daunting Hurdle: Divorce         In many ways, the group captain  might have made an ideal husband. But the fact that he was divorced raised strong objections from the very establishment the royal family represented. As queen, Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, was the supreme governor of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. Moreover, in the early 1950's, the political storm surrounding Edward VIII's abdication in December 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Warfield Simpson, was a not-so-distant memory.         News media scrutiny was relentless and the pressure intense on Princess Margaret, then third in line to the throne, to break off the relationship. Bowing to the demands of a moral code that a decade later would seem quaint to many people, she chose not to marry him.         In May 1960 she married Anthony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who was himself the child of divorced parents. Their tempestuous marriage produced two children, but ended in divorce in 1978. The princess did not remarry, but her friendships with men, from prominent people like the actor Peter Sellers to less exalted ones like Roderic Llewellyn, an upper-class drifter 17 years her junior whose main accomplishment appeared to be a talent for gardening, hurt her reputation.         So did the fact that she was often less than gracious when faced with the drudgery of public appearances -- the ribbon-cuttings, diplomatic functions and endless other official occasions by which Britain's royals justify their position and the public money that finances it. Easily bored and often petulant, the princess was known for indulging her moods, which could swing, as Charles Hussey, a British journalist wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, from ''a gaiety that was sometimes febrile'' to ''Hanoverian gloom.''         Her extravagant style also prompted outrage. Her wedding cost the British government £25,000 -- then the equivalent of $65,000 -- and her six-week honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia cost £40,000, or about $115,000. In later years she was criticized for demanding motorcycle escorts and government helicopters to travel around Britain.         Yet admirers spoke warmly of her personal generosity, loyalty to the queen and to her friends, and her irreverent sense of of fun. Louis Armstrong, whose music she loved, once referred to her as ''one hip chick,'' and John Lennon playfully nicknamed her ''Priceless Margarine.''         To many people, Princess Margaret was the black sheep of her generation of royals. But that reputation did not necessarily trouble her. According to a biographer, Theo Aronson, she once told the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, ''Disobedience is my joy.''         Princess Margaret Rose was born on Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis, Scotland, the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, six years before her father became King George VI with the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.         The Family Braved the Blitz         She was educated at home with her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth II.  During World War II, when the king and queen tried to present an image of both stoicism and good cheer to a battered nation, they rejected the suggestion that their two daughters be sent to Canada to be safe from the danger of the blitz. Instead, the two girls remained with their parents, very much in the public eye.         But with Elizabeth clearly being groomed as the next queen, Princess Margaret was often relegated to the background. According to some courtiers, her parents tried to make up for it by indulging her. ''When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one,'' Princess Margaret told Andrew Duncan, author of ''The Reality of Monarchy'' (1970). ''That was boring so the press tried to make out that I was wicked as hell.''         But in threadbare postwar Britain, the press often portrayed her as a glamorous, high-spirited young woman who delighted in trips to Paris and dancing through the night in fashionable London clubs.         After Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece in November 1947, Princess Margaret became one of the most eligible single women in the world, and her name was coupled with various fashionable young men.         She first met Group Captain Townsend during the war, when he joined King George's entourage. The group captain's heroism -- he shot down 11 German planes -- was coupled with a low-key style that appealed to the king. Indeed, King George was godfather to one of his two sons by his wife, Rosemary Pawle, whom he married in 1941 and divorced in 1952 on the ground of adultery.         His relationship with the princess grew closer after the king's death in February 1952, but it did not become public until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, when Margaret, in a gesture of affection that was captured by news photographers, brushed some lint from his uniform.         Princess Margaret was then 22 and Group Captain Townsend 38. He later wrote that their love ''took no heed of wealth and rank and all the other worldly, conventional barriers which separated us.''         But under the Royal Marriages Act, passed in the reign of George III, Princess Margaret could not marry without the sovereign's permission. Under intense media scrutiny, the affair became as politicized as the one involving King Edward and Mrs. Simpson 16 years before. Both Winston Churchill and the queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, advised against allowing the marriage. Pressing Group Captain Townsend to end the romance, the British government posted him to the British Embassy in Brussels as air attaché in June 1953. Princess Margaret learned of his posting while she was on a tour of Rhodesia.  After her return, the lovers kept in touch by telephone and managed to see each other secretly.         But the government continued to oppose a marriage, and though Princess Margaret turned 25 in 1955 and was thus free to marry without the queen's consent, it was made plain to her that if she chose to marry Group Captain Townsend she would lose her royal rights and income. In October of that year, the couple met in Britain, discussed their situation, and came to a decision.         ''I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend,'' Princess Margaret announced in a statement. ''Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.''         Sympathetic observers later said that if the couple had been permitted to marry, the princess would have settled down to a more conventional life, like her sister. But in his 1978 autobiography, ''Time and Chance,''  Group Captain Townsend wrote, ''I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.''         In 1959 the group captain married Marie Luce Jamagne, a 20-year-old Belgian. The next year, on May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Mr. Armstrong-Jones, also a commoner, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon.         A photographer who made a successful career out of photographing the rich and famous, Mr. Armstrong-Jones also enjoyed the the Bohemian side of London life. He and the princess helped liven the staid image of the royal family with a touch of the Swinging Sixties.         Garland Was Not Amused         But Princess Margaret's love of fun and informality coexisted with a  sterner side. She insisted that she be addressed as ''Ma'am,'' except for her closest friends, who were permitted to call her ''Ma'am darling.'' As a houseguest she was notoriously demanding. At parties she often objected if other guests ignored royal protocol and left before her. Even her children were expected to refer to her as ''Princess Margaret'' in front of visitors. So did her husband,  though he was said to have called her Ducky in private.         The haughty manner alienated many friends. Mr. Aronson relates in ''Princess Margaret'' (1977) how at a party in Beverly Hills she once told Judy Garland through an intermediary that she would like to hear her sing. Angered by the form of the request, Miss Garland replied, ''Tell her I'll sing if she christens a ship first.''         Although the princess and her husband appeared to have a happy family life, by the late 1960's there were nasty public quarrels. This, coupled with an often ill-concealed irritability at official functions and a love of reveling, brought growing public ridicule.         Increasingly resentful of life in the public eye, Lord Snowdon began to spend more time away from the princess, working abroad on photographic projects, sometimes in the company of attractive young women. Princess Margaret also went her own way. She was linked romantically with Anthony Barton, a friend of her husband, and then had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and former army officer who was the nephew of a former prime minister and played the piano in nightclubs.         In February 1967, when the British press began reporting that the royal couple were about to break up, Lord Snowdon, who was working overseas, and Princess Margaret arranged to meet in New York and fly on to the Bahamas, trying to give the impression that nothing was amiss. Shortly afterward, Princess Margaret wrote to Mr. Douglas-Home breaking off the affair. Eighteen months later he committed suicide.         Although the royal couple had made a show of togetherness and were often photographed with their children -- David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones (Viscount Linley) and Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (Lady Sarah Chatto) -- their relations continued to deteriorate.         At Home on a Caribbean Isle         Princess Margaret was often seen in the company of famous men, including Mr. Sellers. She also began to spend more time on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where a friend, Colin Tenant, had given her land as a wedding present and where she built a vacation home known as Les Jolies-Eaux.         In September 1973, at a luncheon in Edinburgh, she met the 25-year-old  Roderic Llewellyn, who soon became a favorite companion. The son of minor nobility, Mr. Llewellyn had worked briefly at a mine in southern Africa and as an apprentice brewer in England. Five months after meeting Princess Margaret he spent three weeks as her guest in Mustique. Although their relationship was soon an open secret in royal circles. the queen, according to Mr. Aronson, was said to have disapproved of Mr. Llewellyn and what she called ''my sister's guttersnipe life.'' But the liaison remained unknown to the public.         Then in February 1976 a news photographer's picture of the couple together on the island caused a scandal. In March the royal family announced that Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret were separating.         Meanwhile, the relationship between the princess and Mr. Llewellyn set off a storm in Parliament. When Mr. Llewellyn was hospitalized with stomach problems during a trip to the Caribbean in March 1978, reports that the princess went to his bedside prompted critics to demand that her royal allowance -- then more than $100,000 a year -- be cut. The battle was played out in the newspapers, with some calling for her to end her relationship with Mr. Llewellyn and take her work more seriously, and others writing in her defense.         Although she was patron of more than 80 charities and organizations, colonel in chief of the Highland Fusiliers of Canada and president of the Royal Ballet, there was increasing resentment of her approach to her duties. Critics complained that the number of her public appearances, which had once averaged 150 a year, had dwindled to well below 100. Some Labor members of Parliament called her an embarrassment to the monarchy.         Then in May, while she was hospitalized with hepatitis, Kensington Palace, where she lived, issued a statement announcing her divorce, an action that ended a 400-year-old taboo on divorce in the royal family.         In the fall, Princess Margaret, on an official visit to Tuvalu in the South Pacific, became ill and had to be flown to Sydney, Australia, for treatment. That December, a month after her return to Britain, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who had been married to a film director.         Princess Margaret's traumatic private life had long taken a toll on her health. She smoked heavily and her enthusiasm for Scotch sometimes shocked her companions. In 1974, according to Mr. Aronson, she suffered a nervous breakdown.         The princess herself remained reticent about her private life. ''I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast,'' she once said.         Sometimes, however, she had a penchant for saying the wrong thing. In October 1979, six weeks after Earl Mountbatten was killed by Irish Republican Army terrorists, she angered many Irish-Americans while on a visit to Chicago, reportedly declaring in the presence of Mayor Jane Byrne that the Irish were ''pigs.''         But she could also be quite gracious. In 1980, when Mr. Llewellyn told her that he was breaking off their relationship to marry Tatiania Soskin, a fashion designer, she assured the younger couple she would be happy to attend their wedding, and she remained friends with both.         Lunch With an Old Lover         As the 1980's progressed, public interest turned to the romantic travails of the next generation of royals. Two of the queen's three sons -- Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Andrew, the Duke of York -- married and divorced under the glare of relentless publicity. Anne, the princess royal and the queen's only daughter, was permitted to divorce her husband, Capt. Mark Philips, and in 1992 married a royal equerry.         Through the years the princess  had corresponded with Peter Townsend and in 1992, while he was on a rare visit to Britain, she invited him to lunch at Kensington Palace attended by several other people. The 77-year-old group captain and the 61-year-old princess sat and ''chatted like the old friends they were.'' Group Captain Townsend died in Paris in 1995.         It was often speculated how different her life might have been had the two been allowed to marry.         ''In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, at the time of Group Captain  Townsend's death. ''After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret's life. The queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they've gone too far in the other direction.''         Princess Margaret is survived by her son, Lord Linley, her daughter, Lady Sarah, and three grandchildren.         As she grew older, the princess  lived less in the public eye. ''They leave me alone these days,'' Mr. Aronson quoted her as saying. ''Today they have other fish to fry.''         Correction:  February 15, 2002, Friday  Because of an editing error, a television review on Feb. 4 about ''Bertie and Elizabeth,'' a ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation on the life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, misstated the policy of the Church of England on divorce, a factor in the abdication of her brother-in-law King Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor. An obituary of her daughter Princess Margaret on Sunday also included the error. The church does not forbid divorce. It revokes the right to marry in a parish church while a former spouse is living. But even then, depending on circumstances, a priest can allow a church wedding.       
         Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a multifaceted writer, defender of marine resources and founder of the International Oceans Institute based in Malta, died on Feb. 8 while on vacation in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 83 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.         Professor Borgese was the last surviving child of Thomas Mann. She was a pianist by training, a multilingual political scientist and a writer of fiction and of oceanic yearbooks.         She helped organize the international Peace in the Oceans Conference of 1970, the first of 30 such meetings worldwide. She was an enduring presence at those gatherings, which brought about the United Nations Law of the Seas treaty in 1982.         Elisabeth Mann was born in Munich, the second youngest of three girls and three boys of Thomas and Katia Pringsheim Mann. (W. H. Auden became her brother-in-law when the poet married her sister Erika to provide her with a British passport.)         Hoping to become a musician, Elisabeth studied the piano and cello, receiving a diploma from the Conservatory of Music in Zurich in 1938.         The Mann family had left Germany after Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland and, in 1938, to the United States. In 1939, Elisabeth married Giuseppe A. Borgese, a professor 36 years her senior who had fled Fascist Italy; he died in 1952.         She became a United States citizen in 1941 but took Canadian citizenship in 1983. She worked as an editor and researcher in Chicago, including two years as executive secretary of the board of the Encyclopedia Britannica in the mid-1960's.         She served as a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif., before joining the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1979, first as a political science professor and later as an adjunct law professor.         In the 1970's, Professor Borgese formed the International Oceans Institute, which has since grown to 20 centers.         She is survived by two daughters, Angelica Borgese of Manhattan and Turkey, and Dr. Domenica Borgese of Milan; a son, Marcel Deschamps of Halifax; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Stuart, a veteran actress and pioneer of soap operas who spent 35 years as the star of one daytime series built around her, died on Thursday at her home in New York. She was 76.         She died after a stroke, but had been ill with gastric cancer and bone cancer, her family said.         Legions of fans lived with and felt they knew her two most famous characters, Joanne Gardner Barron Tate Vincente Tourneur on ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and Meta Bauer on ''The Guiding Light.''         Ms. Stuart, whose original name was Mary Houchins, was born in Miami and grew up in Tulsa, Okla. She started performing in early childhood. When she was 9, Count Basie's orchestra came through town, and held a contest to find a young female singer to perform with them. They chose Ms. Stuart, and she sang ''Little Girl Blue'' at two of their shows, said her husband, Wolfgang Neumann, an architect. The shows were late, so the band provided a cot backstage so she could sleep between sets.         The story of her rise to stardom resembles a Hollywood fantasy. At 17 she hitchhiked to New York, working at various jobs to support herself. For a little while she was a booking agent for an airline. ''Her sense of geography was absolutely abysmal,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''She didn't last long there.''         She became a hat-check and cigarette girl at the Roosevelt Hotel, where she met the film producer Joe Pasternak, who offered her a screen test. Her nerves got the better of her at the audition, her husband said, and Mr. Pasternak reportedly told her: ''You can't sing, you can't walk, but there is something that you have. Let's find out what it is.''         She spent the next few years working in movies in Hollywood, mostly in small parts, but sometimes with an icon of 1940's cinema. She appeared in more than 20 films, including ''The Girl From Jones Beach'' with Ronald Reagan, ''The Adventures of Don Juan'' with Errol Flynn and ''This Time for Keeps'' with Esther Williams.         After a few years, she returned to New York. ''She realized she wasn't cut out for Hollywood,'' her husband said. ''It was too ruthless.''         In 1951, she won the role of Jo in a new CBS soap opera, ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and played the long-suffering Joanne until 1986, when the show, which had moved to NBC, went off the air.         When not acting, Ms. Stuart read to children in the public schools of New York as part of a program called Book PALS (Performing Artists for Literacy in Schools), a program of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation to encourage children to read for pleasure. She started the New York chapter of the program in 1992. She also started a a Reading Club in 1996 for 4th and 5th graders in six schools. Today, more than 3,300 children in 10 schools are members. Nationally, the program is in 18 cities.         Her character on ''Search for Tomorrow'' endured many hardships and husbands, but remained noble and dignified throughout them, and broke new ground along the way. She was the first daytime actress to have her pregnancy written into the plot. The producers even filmed Ms. Stuart at the hospital after she gave birth to her son in 1956.         ''They filmed her in her hospital bed, to satisfy the fans and let them share in her happiness,'' said Mary Alice Dwyer-Dobbin, executive in charge of Procter & Gamble Productions.         Her son's career on the show was short-lived, however. Within a few days his character was killed off in an accident, much to the horror of his mother and the viewers. ''She really played the death of her son,'' said her daughter, Cynthia, ''and it was too painful for viewers to watch.''         Ms. Stuart was married twice before. In addition to her husband, daughter and son, Jeffrey Krolik of California, she is survived by two grandchildren.         For some of her fans her character was real. ''It was just like famìly,'' said Theresa Cristalli, who watched ''Search for Tomorrow''  from the very beginning. ''You keep watching day after day. I got hooked on them.''         Ms. Stuart was as loyal to her fans as they were to her. She responded to as much of her fan mail as she could, her daughter said. She even befriended some; she invited Ms. Cristalli and a friend to view the last taping of the show in 1986, and they kept in touch through cards and letters over the years.         Correction:  March 6, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of the soap opera star Mary Stuart on Sunday misstated her age. She was 75, not 76.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.         Correction:  March 15, 2002, Friday  An obituary on March 6 about Theresa Castro, who with her husband established the company that makes Castro Convertible sofas, omitted some survivors. Mrs. Castro had six grandchildren, not four, and seven great-grandchildren, not five.       
         Shirley Scott, a jazz organist who recorded dozens of albums from the 1950's to the 90's, earning her the nickname ''Queen of the Organ,'' died on Sunday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 67 and lived in West Chester, Pa.         The cause was heart disease brought on by the diet drug known as fen-phen, said Everett Yancey, her son.         Ms. Scott had sued both American Home Products, now known as Wyeth, the manufacturer of one of the drug's components, and the doctor who prescribed it to her. In February 2000 a Philadelphia jury awarded her $8 million.         She had begun using fen-phen in 1995 and within two years developed extensive heart and lung problems, Mr. Yancey said..         Ms. Scott emerged in the mid-1950's, the golden age of Hammond B3 organ jazz, with a quick, punchy sound that merged bebop, gospel and the blues. She had a lighter touch than Jimmy Smith, the leading organist in jazz, and relied on the blues less heavily than he did. In her groups with the saxophonists Eddie  Davis, known as Lockjaw, and Stanley Turrentine, to whom she was married for a number of years, Ms. Scott produced some of the most influential recordings in the smoother, more pop-oriented soul-jazz style.         Her recorded output was great, with more than 50 albums as a leader to her credit, most on the Prestige and Impulse labels. Her first recordings were with Davis, and she played with him on a number of classics, including his ''Cookbook'' albums and the 1958 hit song ''In the Kitchen.''         In 1960 she married Turrentine and made a number of albums with him over the next decade, including ''Soul Shoutin','' ''Blue Flames'' and ''Hip Soul.'' Their music together was often intense, but Ms. Scott also recorded plenty of easygoing tracks, often including show tunes and pop covers like the Beatles' ''Can't Buy Me Love.''         A lifelong Philadelphian, Ms. Scott continued to play clubs in the city into the 90's, though she eventually switched to piano.         In the 90's she also began teaching jazz history and piano at Cheyney University in Cheyney, Pa., and worked as the musical director for Bill Cosby's short-lived television quiz show, ''You Bet Your Life.''         In addition to Mr. Yancey, of Philadelphia, she is survived by her son Thomas, also of Philadelphia; three daughters, Lisa Turrentine, of West Chester, Pa., and Pamela and Nicole Turrentine, of Philadelphia; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Rosetta LeNoire, a theatrical producer and a pioneer of nontraditional casting who also played the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on the television show ''Family Matters,'' died on Sunday in Teaneck, N.J. She was 90.         She lived at the Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home in Englewood, N.J., after spending most of her life in the Bronx, said Donna Trinkoff, producing director of the Amas Musical Theater. Miss LeNoire founded Amas, a nonprofit theater group, in 1968, partly to promote interracial casting. The company produced hits including ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         Miss LeNoire's life coincided with glittering moments in show business. Her godfather was Bill Robinson, the tap dancer known as Bojangles, and her music teacher was the jazz pianist and composer Eubie Blake. She was directed by Orson Welles in his all-black version of ''Macbeth'' in the 1930's.         She acted in some of the earliest television shows, and once joked that she seemed to play every maid's role on Broadway.         Perhaps as a result, she was an early and effective advocate of expanding opportunities for minority performers to act in plays and musicals. In 1989, her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who was then president of Actors' Equity, chose Miss LeNoire as the first recipient of what became the union's annual award for broadening participation in theater. The award was named for her.         ''Rosetta created nontraditional casting before the phrase itself was created,'' The New York Beacon, a newspaper with a largely black readership, said in 1997.         In 1999, President Clinton lauded her long fight against discrimination as he presented her with the National Medal of the Arts, one of her many honors.         ''Rosetta did more than dream of a theater with no color bar -- she actually built one,'' he said.         Miss LeNoire, whose name was originally Rosetta Burton, was born in 1911 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan. Her paternal grandfather played the organ for five churches in the West Indies, and her father was one of the first black plumbers and electricians licensed by New York State.         When she was a child, her mother died of pneumonia at the age of 27 after giving birth to her brother in a Harlem hospital corridor because segregated policies barred her from a room. Rosetta was crippled with rickets, a result of vitamin deprivation, and when she was 7 doctors broke her legs so the bones could grow properly.         Mr. Robinson, a member of the Elks Club with her father, volunteered to become godfather of the girl he called Brown Sugar. At 13, when her leg braces came off, she began music lessons with Mr. Blake, who told her to ''look up and be proud of yourself.'' When she was 15, she became a chorus girl with the Time Steppers, Mr. Robinson's troupe.         A marriage to an elevator operator ended in divorce. She then married Egbert Brown, who owned a fleet of cabs; he died after 26 years of marriage.         She is survived by her son, William, of Manahawkin, N.J.; her sister, Mary A. Francis of Palm Coast, Fla.; her brothers, Wilmote Burton of the Bronx, and Warren Burton of Palm Coast; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Study at a government-sponsored Works Progress Administration program at a theater on the Lower East Side led to a role in the all-black version of ''Macbeth,'' which Orson Welles was producing in Harlem. She toured with the production.         ''Good lord! He was a delegate from heaven,'' she said of Mr. Welles. ''He was the only one who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to Shakespeare.''         Later she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to acting, she cared for Mr. Jones's infant son, James Earl Jones.         She made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''The Hot Mikado,'' an all-black version of the operetta.         ''It was something,'' she said. ''There were 125 of us, all black Japanese.''         Her other theater credits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Sunshine Boys,'' ''Lost in the Stars,'' ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Sophie.'' She played the role of Stella in ''Anna Lucasta'' in 1944, toured with the show and starred in the 1958 film version, with Sammy Davis Jr. and Eartha Kitt. Her other movie credits include ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Playing for Keeps'' and ''Brewster's Millions.''         She worked in television during its experimental days, and later appeared in ''Search for Tomorrow,'' ''The Guiding Light,'' ''Amen'' and ''A World Apart. She played Nell Carter's mother, Mama, on NBC's ''Gimme a Break'' and was Mother Winslow on ABC's ''Family Matters'' for eight years.         Eight years after founding Amas, she added a children's theatrical course to its program. (Amas is a form of the verb ''to love'' in Latin.) The company's hits included ''Bojangles'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' a Tony nominee in 1976.         ''I produce musicals,'' she said. ''Music is one avenue where no one seems to have any discriminatory attitudes.''       
         Dorothy DeLay, one of the world's most famous teachers of the violin and a mentor to two generations of players ranging from Itzhak Perlman to Midori and Sarah Chang, died on Sunday. She was 84 and lived in Upper Nyack, N.Y.         Miss DeLay, as her students continued to call her even after they became star performers, began her teaching career almost as an afterthought in 1947, when she was a student of Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School. Accepting a handful of invitations for part-time teaching and assistantships at the Henry Street Settlement, the Juilliard School and Sarah Lawrence College led her to realize that she enjoyed teaching more than she enjoyed performing.         For more than 20 years she worked largely in Galamian's shadow, but in the 1970's she became a sought-after teacher in her own right, and became the first woman -- and the first American-born violnist -- to be regarded as a master violin teacher in the tradition of Galamian and Leopold Auer.         The list of students who became famous soon after leaving her studio quickly blossomed starting in the 1970's. In addition to Mr. Perlman, Midori and Ms. Chang, they include Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Nigel Kennedy, Gil Shaham, Shlomo Mintz and Cho-Liang Lin. Also among her pupils are members and often founders of some of the world's great chamber groups, among them the Juilliard, the Tokyo, the Cleveland, the Vermeer, the Takacs and the Ying Quartets. Others like Joseph Swenson and Peter Oundjian became conductors and many became concertmasters and section players in orchestras around the world as well as members of conservatory faculties. At the Juilliard School, the faculty includes 14 of her former students.         Miss DeLay was as well known for her easygoing, direct manner and her homey advice as she was for the demanding five-hour practice regimen she recommended in which full hours were devoted to technical basics, etudes, repertory pieces, concertos and works by Bach but also in which 10-minute breaks between hours were allowed. Instead of imposing her views about the great violin repertory on her pupils, she encouraged them to discuss their own interpretive ideas. If they appeared to be on the wrong path, she would gently steer them right. Some of her former students described her work in Zen-like terms.         ''I think the greatest things about Dorothy DeLay,'' Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg said in a 1992 interview, ''is that she has the ability to look at a young student or an old student and pretty much size up their character and the way that they think -- their personality, basically -- and how in a short period of time what's the best door to use to get them into here. And that's her method -- that fact that there is really no method.''         Yet Miss DeLay's easygoing manner was not to be taken entirely at face value. Having molded dozens of top-flight soloists, she also became an important power broker in the music business. Conductors and managers trusted her advice.         Dorothy DeLay was born on March 31, 1917, in Medicine Lodge, Kan. Her parents were both musicians and teachers. She later described the household as strict and religious and said that her mother briefly toured the country with Carry Nation, campaigning against alcohol. Miss DeLay began playing the violin when she was 4 and gave a recital at her church when she was 5. When she was 16, she enrolled at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio, where she studied the violin with Raymond Cerf, a student of the Belgian virtuoso and composer Eugène Ysaye.         After a year Miss DeLay transferred to Michigan State University, after her parents decided that they did not want her to study solely music. But the violin remained her focus, and after her graduation in 1937, when she was 20, she moved to New York and enrolled at the Juilliard School to continue her studies with Louis Persinger, Hans Letz and Felix Salmond. As a student, Miss DeLay supported herself by working as a baby sitter and playing the violin in restaurants, at weddings and in Broadway theater orchestras. But she also began performing as a recitalist and in a chamber ensemble, the Stuyvesant Trio, which included her sister Nellis, a cellist, and Helen Brainard, a pianist; and she toured Latin America as a member of Leopold Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra.         During a cross-country train journey at the end of the All-American Youth Orchestra tour in 1940, Miss DeLay met Edward Newhouse, a novelist and short story writer for The New Yorker. They were married early in 1941 after a courtship of four months. Mr. Newhouse survives Miss DeLay, as do their son, Jeffrey Newhouse, of Bronxville, and their daughter, Alison Dinsmore, of Boston, as well as four grandchildren.         Miss DeLay continued touring as a soloist and with the Stuyvesant Trio after her marriage, but by the mid-1940's she decided that she did not like performing. She briefly considered studying medicine but decided instead to return to the Juilliard School in 1946 for more violin studies. Her teacher was Galamian; two years later she became his assistant, both at Juilliard and at the summer camp he had established in 1944, Meadowmount.         It was Galamian's devotion to teaching that inspired Miss DeLay to give it a try. She maintained her association with the Juilliard School for the rest of her life and taught at Sarah Lawrence College from 1947 to 1987. Her other teaching associations included Meadowmount, Aspen, the University of Cincinnati, the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, the New England Conservatory, and the Royal College of Music in London.         By the late 1960's Miss DeLay's relationship with Galamian became strained, partly because of growing differences in their teaching methods and philosophies. But there were personal tensions as well, and their relationship ruptured entirely in 1970 when Miss DeLay telephoned Galamian to say that she would teach the following summer at Aspen instead of at his Meadowmount school. Galamian never spoke with Miss DeLay again, and when his demand that the Juilliard School fire her was not met, he told students who were working with both of them that they had to make a choice. Among those who chose Miss DeLay was Mr. Perlman.         ''With Galamian there was almost no room for give and take because he had a particular system that he applied to everybody,'' Mr. Perlman told Barbara Lourie Sand, the author of ''Teaching Genius: Dorothy DeLay and the Making of a Musician,'' a book about Miss DeLay, published in 2000. ''Miss DeLay was much more flexible, was much more into the person, and into their background, into what makes them tick. I would come and play for her, and if something was not quite right, it wasn't like she was going to kill me.         ''That's where we come to the differences between the two. She would ask questions about what you thought of particular phrases -- where the top of the phrase was, and so on. We would have a very friendly, interesting discussion about 'Why do you think it should sound like this?' and 'What do you think of that?' I was not quite used to this way of approaching things.''         With Miss DeLay's growing fame in the 1980's and 90's came detractors, including former students who complained that she was frequently late to lessons or that her essentially anti-authoritarian mode of teaching was actually lax and uninvolved. Still, by the late 1980's, her studio had become a soloist factory of sorts: a concertgoer reading her name in the program biography of a young performer could be assured of a high level of playing and often a particular kind of sound -- lush and beautifully burnished with a big but not overwhelming vibrato.         In addition to many honorary degrees, Miss DeLay received the National Medal of Arts in 1994, the National Music Council's American Eagle Award in 1995, the Sanford Medal from Yale University in 1997 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese Government in 1998.       
         Lakshmi Knight, a dancer and teacher of Indian classical dance who performed widely in the United States in the style specifically associated with her mother, the great dancer Balasaraswati, died in Chennai, India, on Dec. 23. She was 58 and lived in Chennai and Hunterdon, N.J.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Douglas Knight Jr., who survives her along with their son, Aniruddha, a dancer who is the last direct inheritor of the music and dance traditions preserved in his family for 10 generations. News of her death was delayed until the family returned from India.         Lakshmi used only her given name as a dancer, but those who knew her as Balasaraswati's daughter knew that she was descended from a continuous line of distinguished musicians and dancers at the court of Tanjore in South India.         Although Bharata Natyam, the Indian classical dance form that is best known today, has many exponents, the style of Bharata Natyam that Lakshmi inherited was part of the repertory and forms codified by her ancestors as court performers in the early 1800's.         The expressive side of this tradition was well documented in ''Bala,'' a 1976 film about Balasaraswati by the Indian director Satyajit Ray. Lakshmi, a vibrant performer who was schooled in her mother's nuanced approach to gesture, was noted for her improvisation within Bharata Natyam's set forms. The use of improvisation to interpret poetic texts sung during a Bharata Natyam performance was the hallmark of Balasaraswati's style.         Mr. Knight, an American who is an Indian classical musician, noted that after Balasaraswati's death in 1984, this interpretative aspect was unique to Lakshmi and was integrated with the musical sensitivity of her family tradition. Lakshmi was trained in music by her uncle, T. Viswanathan, who teaches at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.         Born in Madras on Oct. 30, 1943, Lakshmi grew up in a home filled with music and dance but studied political science at college before she asked her mother to give her formal lessons. Although she started dance late, she began performing in the 1970's and then also lectured in both India and the United States.         During the 1980's and 1990's, Lakshmi performed often in the New York area and appeared at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., and the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C.         In a review of a 1987 performance in The New York Times, Jennifer Dunning wrote, ''Lakshmi proceeded from poignant dismay to the delight of memory and back to loss through smooth-changing facial expressions and most movingly, through the tilt of her head and upper body.''         And in describing a 1992 Lakshmi performance, Jack Anderson wrote in The New York Times that ''even dancegoers unfamiliar with Indian mythology could be swept away by the emotions her solos depicted.''       
         Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the enduringly popular grande dame of the British royal family and the country's most beloved symbol of courage and self-sacrifice during World War II, died in her sleep this afternoon at the Royal Lodge at Windsor Palace, a spokesman for her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, announced. She was 101.         In a life longer than the 20th century, the queen mother presided over a period of turbulence and change in Britain, helping to sustain the monarchy through the most serious crises to befall it in modern times.         In 1936, when her painfully diffident husband was crowned King George VI after the abdication of his older brother, she became the strength behind the throne, helping transform him from a stammering, insecure second son into a loved and respected monarch.         As queen during World War II, her decision to remain in London through the worst days of the blitz proved a rallying point for Britons desperate for the sort of leadership that only a monarch could provide. And when Buckingham Palace was bombed, she forever endeared herself to the nation by declaring herself in solidarity with the working-class people of London's bomb-ravaged East End.         ''I am almost glad we have been bombed,'' she said, in what became one of the war's most memorable remarks. ''Now I feel I can look the East End in the face.''         Many years later, through the traumas of the divorce and then the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, her granddaughter-in-law, the queen mother proved to be the royal family's most resiliently popular member, providing the country with a rock-steady reason for remaining a monarchy. News of her death today dealt a blow to Britons accustomed to her enduring presence. [Page 16.]         When King George died in 1952, she was thrust at the age of 51 into what would be the longest role of her life: that of the queen mother, necessarily taking a back seat to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. But in the eyes of a country that never lost its abiding affection for its good-natured ''Queen Mum,'' it was a role she fulfilled with grace, carrying out a grueling schedule of public engagements well into her 90's and never losing her common touch, which included a healthy appetite for a glass or two of gin and a love of horse racing and trout fishing.         ''She is the nation's favorite great-grandmother, seemingly known intimately to all of us for years,'' The Times of London declared in 1985, on the occasion of the queen mother's 85th birthday (she celebrated it by flying on the Concorde). ''She has helped make the royal family more secure in the nation's affections than it has been at any other time in history.''         Ben Pimlott, the historian and royal biographer, wrote in 1997 that the queen mother was ''the last survivor of the tiny club of center-stage actors of the Second World War.'' He continued: ''She has also shown a chameleon-like ability to adapt to shifting conditions, something her deeply conservative nature makes the more remarkable. Unlike most public figures, she does not date. She has never made an intellectual remark in her life. Her knack has been to look for the best in people and offer a kind of looking glass to the virtues they would like to have.''         Father Was an Eccentric         Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was born in London on Aug. 4, 1900, in the waning days of the reign of Queen Victoria, a golden time for the British monarchy and its empire. She was the fourth daughter and ninth child of Lord Glamis, a Scottish nobleman whose family occupied Glamis Castle in Scotland, said to be the place where Macbeth murdered Duncan in Shakespeare's play. When his father died four years later, Lord Glamis inherited a considerable fortune and an even more impressive title, becoming the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis.         Lord Strathmore was a bona fide aristocratic eccentric. He had a deep mistrust of eggs (''Poison, my dear, poison,'' he would intone ominously at the breakfast table) and a habit of dragging dead branches from his woods in the middle of the night. Dressed in an old raincoat tied with string, he would then split them into logs for the fire.         Raised partly at Glamis and partly in the fashionable Knightsbridge section of London, the young Lady Elizabeth was by all accounts sunny almost to a fault. Her favorite hobby, she once wrote in an autograph album, was ''making friends.''         Indifferently educated by governesses, Elizabeth spent much of her youth doing what young aristocratic women generally did at the time: learning arts like household management and enjoying herself. The real world intruded during World War I, though, when her brothers went off to fight and Glamis was turned for four years into a convalescent home for soldiers. Wanting to protect her mother from bad news, Elizabeth made sure to waylay the mailman every morning so that she could read the mail first. In fact, there was bad news: one of Elizabeth's brothers was killed, sending Lady Strathmore into a depression from which she never really recovered.         When the war was over, Elizabeth's social life, essentially an extended search for a husband in the guise of a series of amusing diversions, began in earnest. Her biographers tend to agree that she was a great success as a debutante, flirting wildly and constantly fending off a large coterie of broken-hearted suitors, one of whom reportedly -- and unromantically -- serenaded her by cracking his hunting whip under her bedroom window at night.         Elizabeth and Bertie         Although history is hazy on facts, several biographers say there was one suitor whom Elizabeth was genuinely in love with: Maj. James Stuart, the equerry to Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, the Duke of York and King George V's second son. But if there was a romance there, it never went anywhere. Albert began courting Elizabeth himself, and Major Stuart ended up being summarily shipped off to work on an oil rig in Oklahoma. The day before Elizabeth's wedding, he announced his own engagement to one of her friends.         The romance between Elizabeth and Bertie, as the prince was known, apparently did not begin promisingly. Bullied by his parents and overshadowed by his handsome and charming older brother, David, the Prince of Wales, Bertie suffered from delicate health, crippling shyness, an array of nervous tics, a terrible stutter, an unpredictable temper, a tendency to melancholy and what today would be described as a serious case of low self-esteem. When he asked his parents' permission to pursue Elizabeth, his father murmured, ''You'll be a lucky fellow if she accepts you.''         Elizabeth did resist Bertie's attentions for several years, finally accepting his proposal in 1923 and thus agreeing to become the first commoner (anyone below the rank of peer or peeress) to marry so close to the throne since the 17th century. It was when her engagement was announced that Lady Elizabeth had her first and only on-the-record conversation with a reporter. The interview was harmless enough -- ''I play golf, badly, and I am fond of lawn tennis,'' she confided -- but she was roundly rebuked by the king, and never gave another interview.         The wedding was a national extravaganza, but afterward Elizabeth, now the Duchess of York, settled in relatively modest circumstances, at least by royal standards. Though the house she shared with Bertie at 145 Piccadilly, London, had 25 bedrooms and 21 servants, it was hardly a palace, and it opened onto a communal garden at the back. They had two children, Elizabeth, known as Lilibet, and Margaret Rose, and the Duchess settled into a pleasant life of regal domesticity, saying her main duty was ''bringing up her children.''         Another duty was bucking up the flagging spirits of her husband, who hated the spotlight but who was required to make many public appearances, particularly as his father's health waned and his older brother proved more interested in a racy social life than in boring regal duties. But while in many ways the personalities of the Yorks could not have been more different -- she was ebullient where he was glum, relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was laconic -- they were surprisingly well suited.         Among other things, Elizabeth forced Bertie to seek treatment for what was delicately referred to as his ''affliction,'' and the two visited a Harley Street doctor nearly every day for some two and a half months, as Bertie learned to keep his stutter in check. The marriage proved to be just what the future king needed, Bertie's official biographer, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, would later write. ''It brought him much for which he had long craved in deprivation -- love, understanding, sympathy, support,'' he said. ''All these things were now his in generous abundance, and his whole conspectus of life changed accordingly.''         Edward and Mrs. Simpson         The coziness of their early years was abruptly shattered in 1936, when King Edward VIII, as Bertie's older brother styled himself on ascending the throne, announced that he had fallen inconveniently in love with the very married Wallis Simpson, an American whose earlier divorce from her first husband had already ruled her out as a possible royal bride.         Not even the exhortations of his most trusted advisers, or the frightened tears of his younger brother, would make Edward give up Mrs. Simpson, and on Dec. 10, 1936, he abdicated and left for France. Mrs. Simpson got a divorce in 1937, and the two eventually married, adopted a flotilla of small dogs, and spent the rest of their lives in glamorous if bitter exile as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         The terrified Bertie was left behind to comfort a shocked nation and to try to rise to the occasion. ''Dickie, this is absolutely terrible,'' he told his friend and cousin Lord Mountbatten. ''I'm quite unprepared for it. David has been trained for this all his life. I've never even seen a state paper.'' It was clear, even then, how much he depended on Elizabeth. ''With my wife and helpmeet by my side, I take up the heavy burden which lies before me,'' he said on his first day as king.         Elizabeth may have seemed complaisant and sweet, but she had a ''steel hand within a velvet glove,'' in the words of Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, and she never forgave David or Wallis Simpson for throwing her husband to the wolves. ''She can forgive any act but treachery, and then she is implacable as any Scot,'' wrote Dorothy Laird, one of Elizabeth's biographers. ''The wound goes very deep.'' Most of her anger, it seems, was directed against the duchess.         Bertie himself was so unnerved that he never mentioned Wallis's name, referring to her in his diary as ''Mrs. S.,'' but the queen certainly had a hand in ensuring that she and her brother-in-law had as rough a time as possible. On the eve of their wedding and in a move that foreshadowed the battle over a post-divorce title for Diana, the Princess of Wales, more than 50 years later, the couple were informed that while the duke would continue to be styled ''royal highness,'' the duchess would not. The wedding was a tiny, fraught affair, with only 12 guests, none from David's family.         Acutely sensitive to what they saw as the duke's efforts to set up an unofficial rival court, the king and queen continually thwarted David's efforts to return home with Wallis. It was not until 30 years later, with Bertie long dead, that Elizabeth was to come face to face again with her hated sister-in-law, whom she always called in private ''the woman who killed my husband.'' (Wallis was not particularly fond of her, either, referring to her as ''Cookie'' in a disparaging reference to her plumpness.)         The crisis having been weathered, the new king and queen set out to remove some of the stuffiness from royal life, dispensing, for instance, with the custom of requiring the king's daughters to curtsy to him. But they would soon find other matters preoccupying them, as the country became consumed with the specter of impending war. The king tried valiantly, if ineffectually, to do his part for diplomacy, preparing a personal letter to Hitler in 1938 that appealed to him ''as one ex-serviceman to another'' and begged him to spare the world from another war. (In the end, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, sternly if gently forbade the King to send the letter.)         The King and the President         Early in 1939, Elizabeth and Bertie traveled to Hyde Park, N.Y., to visit Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, the president and first lady of the United States. The trip, in which they had their first taste of hot dogs, cemented a friendship that was to prove helpful in obtaining American support for the war effort later. In her memoirs, Mrs. Roosevelt described the easy banter between the king and the president.         ''My mother does not approve of cocktails and thinks you should have a cup of tea,'' Roosevelt said. ''Neither does my mother,'' the king replied. Then they both had cocktails.         War broke out in August, when Hitler invaded Poland, and Elizabeth was formally advised by the British cabinet to take her daughters to Canada until the danger was past. She refused to go, stoutly declaring that ''the princesses would never leave without me, and I wouldn't leave without the king, and the king will never leave.'' Instead, she remained in London, enthusiastically taking target practice at the palace with a revolver that was a gift from the new prime minister, Winston Churchill.         The royal family's role in wartime was a largely ceremonial one -- visiting Red Cross centers, civil defense installations, air-raid shelters, hospitals and munition factories; comforting the wounded, and boosting the morale of soldier and civilian alike --but the importance of such ceremony at such a time cannot be overstated.         ''Your majesty, don't you know what you mean to all of us in this country?'' the minister of food at the time, Lord Woolton, once said to Elizabeth. ''It isn't only your high position that matters; it is the fact that the vast majority of people think of you as a person who would speak the kindly word, and, if it fell within your power, would take the cup of hot soup to the needy person.''         Though the king made secret visits to the troops and Elizabeth made a point of visiting places that had been bombed, invariably wearing a smart dress and pearls, they were relatively unaffected personally until Sept. 13, 1940. That day, as the royal couple sat in one of their living rooms at Buckingham Palace, the palace was struck by half a dozen German bombs, which damaged its courtyard and destroyed its chapel. Although they were able to take refuge in an unusually upscale bomb shelter, prepared by the queen with handsome furniture and a supply of fashion magazines, it was then that the queen made her enduring remark about being able ''to look the East End in the eye.''         In a biography of Elizabeth, the royal writer Anthony Holden called it ''a phrase which will reverberate through the history of the British monarchy's relations with its people.'' He continued, ''Never before, or indeed since, had such a strength of fellow-feeling been so genuine and so widely shared.''         A Spartan Windsor Castle         The queen also made it clear that she was determined to adhere to strict rules of wartime economy. Although the royal family's life was naturally easier than that of most of her countrymen, it was still rigorously ascetic. Windsor Castle, where Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were to spend the next five years, had no heat except for the occasional space heater, and just one bare bulb for each room.         When Mrs. Roosevelt visited Buckingham Palace in 1942, she found a bathtub painted with a black line above which water was not supposed to rise; food that was close to inedible (and severely rationed) and rooms that were so cold that the women wore fur coats and blankets indoors.         Not even Churchill escaped. Accustomed to eating meager sandwiches served by the queen during his weekly luncheon meetings with the king, he found on one occasion that the food was even more horrific than usual. ''I don't know what is in these sandwiches,'' the king told the prime minister. ''Sawdust, I suppose.''         The king's always fragile health was not improved by the stresses of the war or by his lifelong smoking habit, and after victory was declared in 1945, he began the long, slow decline that would result in his death, from lung cancer, in 1952. With the death of her husband, Elizabeth had to face the fact that she was no longer on center stage, would have to leave Buckingham Palace, and would, if protocol was strictly followed, have to curtsy to her own daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Riven with grief, she wrote to President Eisenhower that ''one cannot imagine life without him, but one must carry on as he would have wished.''         In the past, widowed mothers of monarchs were known as queen dowagers, but Elizabeth rejected that title in favor of the more impressive one she held to her death: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. As queen mother, she lost neither her formidability nor her ability to influence. The new queen was just 25 when she ascended the throne, and relied heavily on the advice of her mother. The operators at Clarence House, which became the queen mother's official residence, soon became used to putting through her daughter's daily telephone call: ''Your majesty?'' they would say, ''I have her majesty on the line, your majesty.''         Another Divorce Crisis         Soon afterward, another crisis befell the monarchy when Princess Margaret, the queen mother's younger daughter, fell in love with a divorced man, Peter Townsend, a hero of the Battle of Britain. It is unclear what role her mother played in the queen's decision to inform Margaret that she would have to give up her royal status and leave the country if she married Mr. Townsend, but the lessons of Edward's abdication were surely not lost to her now. The princess gave up her beau, married the photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones five years later, and ended up divorcing him 15 years after that. Margaret died on Feb. 9, predeceasing her mother by less than two months.         Bolstered by a large staff, a number of houses at her disposal, and an allowance of more than $1 million a year from Parliament, the queen mother kept up a busy schedule that began to ease up only when she was in her 80's. She served as either president or patron of 312 British organizations, ranging, as one biographer put it, ''from the Royal Agricultural Society to the Dachshund Club.'' As a link to the past, a symbol of continuity, and, to many, a potent reminder of Britain's finest hour, the she remained a familiar figure even in her late 90's, in her cheerful, brightly colored dresses, large flowery hats and ready smile.         Her health problems over the years always became a cause for concern in a country that simply did not want her to die. She had two hip-replacement operations in her late 90's, which invariably ended with her hobbling slowly out of the hospital while crowds of well-wishers cheered. What the public did not learn, until it was finally reported by the news media much later, was that she underwent a colostomy in 1966 and had to wear a bag to collect her wastes for the rest of her life.         In recent years, there were niggling criticisms of the queen mother: that she was a bon vivant who spent far beyond her means; that she kept too many houses and employed too many servants and generally thought too much of her own comfort. But such sniping was relatively muted.         She remained popular because, in a very different and much more real way than Diana had been, she was a monarch who never lost the common touch. Nor did she lose her rather sly, flirtatious smile, her beguiling manner (''I work awfully hard, but Mummy has all the charm,'' her daughter Elizabeth once said) or her easy way with the public.         Reveling in meeting and chatting to new people (''If we do not pass on, I shall soon pass out,'' her husband once said as Elizabeth persisted in chatting at a public appearance), she was also eternally tactful and diplomatic. At a luncheon on a trip to South Africa, she once listened patiently as an irate Afrikaaner mayor complained about the indignities his countrymen had suffered at the hands of the English. ''Oh, I do understand so well,'' Elizabeth responded. ''That's just how we feel about them in Scotland.''         And once, after touring a garden in London, she stayed on for tea. ''I hear you like gin?'' her hostess blurted out, instantly afraid of appearing tactless. But the queen mother thought it delightful.         ''I hadn't realized I enjoyed that reputation,'' she replied. ''But as I do, perhaps you could make it a large one.''         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother yesterday misstated the name of the royal estate where she died. It is Windsor Castle, not Windsor Palace.         Correction:  April 3, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on Sunday misstated the date of Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, which prompted the cabinet to suggest that she take her daughters to Canada. It was Sept. 1, not in August.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a  golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.       
         Shelley Mydans, a journalist who with her husband, the photographer Carl Mydans, covered the war in Asia in World War II and later wrote a novel based on their 21 months in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, died on Thursday in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 86.         Mrs. Mydans was the author of three novels and co-author of a nonfiction book. She and her husband were Life magazine's first photographer-reporter team to cover the war.         Shelley Smith Mydans was born on May 20, 1915, in Palo Alto, Calif., the daughter of a professor of journalism at Stanford University.         After attending Stanford, she worked briefly for The Literary Digest and then joined the staff of Life magazine as a researcher-reporter. She met Mr. Mydans, a Life photographer, and they were married in 1938. In 1939 they were sent together to Europe. They stayed until the fall of France and then were sent to Chongqing, China, to report on the Sino-Japanese war and, after that, to the Western Pacific.         At the time of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, they were based in Manila and were taken prisoner when Japanese forces arrived. After nearly two years in captivity, they were returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Mrs. Mydans's first novel, ''The Open City,'' published in 1945, was based on the experiences of Americans captured by the Japanese.         After their release, she and her husband both returned to the Philippines. At the end of the war she moved to New York, becoming a commentator for a Time Inc. radio news program and writing for Time and Life; when Mr. Mydans was bureau chief for Time and Life in Tokyo, she also reported from there.         Her other books were ''Thomas,'' a novel based on the life of Thomas à Becket; ''The Vermilion Bridge,'' a novel about eighth-century Japan; and ''The Violent Peace,'' a report on wars, insurgency and terrorism  since World War II, which she wrote with Mr. Mydans.         Mrs. Mydans is survived by her husband; their son, Seth, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times; their daughter, Shelley, known as Misty, of Sacramento, Calif.; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.       
         Chaike Belchatowska Spiegel, one of the last surviving combatants of the 1943 Warsaw ghetto uprising against the Nazis, died in Montreal on March 26. She was 81.         She had been hospitalized for about two years, her family said.         Probably no more than 10 other combatants from the uprising are still alive, said her son-in-law, Eugene Orenstein, who teaches modern Jewish history at McGill University in Montreal.         In January 1943, Chaike Belchatowska joined the Jewish Fighting Organization, known by its Polish acronym ZOB, which had been formed the previous year to resist the deportation of Jews from the ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp by the Nazi forces that had overrun Poland in 1939.         On April 19, the first night of the Jewish feast of Passover that year, a Nazi force, equipped with tanks and artillery and under the command of Col. Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, entered the ghetto to resume the deportations, which had been suspended in January after running into stiff resistance.         This time the Nazis were repulsed from the ghetto altogether, suffering heavy losses at the hands of the ZOB and other resistance groups, all of them poorly armed with only a few smuggled guns, little ammunition and homemade gasoline bombs.         Colonel Sammern-Frankenegg was relieved of his command and replaced by Gen. Jürgen Stroop, who attacked again.         But the Nazi forces found themselves blocked once more by fierce Jewish resistance after several days of vicious street fighting.         The Germans then changed tactics and, using flame throwers, began systematically burning down the houses of the ghetto. The ZOB headquarters fell on May 8, but sporadic resistance continued into June and July.         Meanwhile, Ms. Belchatowska, together with her husband-to-be, Boruch Spiegel, the leader of a ZOB fighting unit, and some 50 other Jewish resistance fighters, managed to escape from the ghetto to the forests outside Warsaw; from there, they continued to harass the Germans until the end of the war.         After the Germans were driven from Poland by Soviet troops, Ms. Belchatowska and Mr. Spiegel moved to Sweden, where they married and where their son Chil, or Julius, was born. In late 1948 they went to Montreal after failing to obtain a visa for the United States.         Chaike Belchatowska Spiegel, who was often known in English as Helen, was born in Warsaw on Nov. 11, 1920. Her parents separated shortly afterward, and she was raised by her mother, who was an active Jewish socialist.         She inherited much of her mother's political philosophy, becoming a member of the Jewish Labor Bund, an organization founded in Czarist Russia to promote a brand of Marxist socialism that would provide cultural autonomy for Jews.         After the first mass deportations from the Warsaw ghetto in the summer of 1942, she encouraged Jews to resist being moved by every means possible.         She helped circulate a Yiddish-language paper warning that their real destination would be Treblinka and that the Nazis were lying when they encouraged volunteers by promising them more food and greater freedom.         In November of that year, she herself was herded onto a train bound for Treblinka but managed to break out of a cattle car and escape back to the ghetto.         After moving to Montreal, Mrs. Spiegel and her husband ran a business making purses and other leather goods. She is survived by her husband; their son, Julius, who is the Brooklyn parks commissioner, and their daughter, Mindy Spiegel of Montreal.       
         Linda Boreman, the woman once known as Linda Lovelace, who starred in one of the first feature-length pornography movies, ''Deep Throat,'' and who later denounced it as depicting her ''rape,'' died on Monday in Denver. She was 53.         The cause was injuries from a car accident on April 3, her family said.         The 62-minute film, released in 1972, made money so fast that its producers joked they had to weigh their receipts each day; by many estimates it earned more than $600 million. It cost just $30,000 to make, according to Variety. Ms. Boreman said she was paid nothing.         ''Deep Throat'' and Linda Lovelace became household words and figured in three dozen books and 18 published songs. During Watergate, Washington Post reporters called their secret source Deep Throat.         But Ms. Boreman testified about the dangers of pornography before Congress, courts and city councils in the 1980's, and became a poster child for feminists like Gloria Steinem, who wrote an introduction to her 1986 book with Mike McGrady, ''Out of Bondage.''         Ms. Boreman insisted that she had made the movie only because her husband at the time, Chuck Traynor, threatened her with violence. ''I knew the feeling of a gun to my back and hearing the click, never knowing when there was going to be a real bullet,'' she said in her 1980 autobiography, ''Ordeal,'' written with Mr. McGrady.         Linda Boreman was born in the Bronx on Jan. 10, 1949, and moved to Yonkers when she was 3. Her father was a police officer, and her mother held Tupperware parties.         ''How does she do it?'' Vincent Canby asked in an article in The New York Times. ''The film has less to do with the manifold pleasures of sex than with physical engineering.''         She told of literally escaping from Mr. Traynor, who was already seeing his second wife, Marilyn Chambers, another pornography star. She hid out in different hotels for weeks, then began appearing in Las Vegas and London in skimpy costumes, drawing a smattering of publicity. The movie career for which she had hoped never materialized.         She later married Larry Marchiano. They divorced in 1996. She is survived by their children, a daughter, Lindsay, and a son, Dominic; a sister, Barbara Boreman; and three grandchildren.         The family lived on welfare when Mr. Marchiano was unemployed, and Ms. Boreman had a liver transplant in 1987. After they moved to Denver in 1990, she worked at low-paying jobs.         In recent years, she enjoyed the reception she received at memorabilia shows, said Eric Danville, author of ''The Complete Linda Lovelace'' (Power Process Publishing, 2001). ''People would tell her how much they loved her 100 times a day,'' he said.         Mr. Danville also recalled watching ''Deep Throat'' with her nine months ago. It was the first time she had seen it from start to finish.         ''I don't see what the big deal was,'' she said.       
         Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, who emerged as a popular, prolific writer of keenly observed nonfiction with a 1978 book about the dozen years she spent as a Jehovah's Witness, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 67 and lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her daughter, Anna Harrison. She once wrote that for years she smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.         The turning point in her life and career was her decision, at 22, to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade a college education. What followed was a successful self-education and a blossoming into a multifaceted writer of literate travel books, many essays and reviews, and a novel.         With ''Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Simon & Schuster), she became nationally known; her later work, mostly nonfiction, usually received excellent reviews.         In The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick said ''Visions of Glory'' was ''quite well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the personality of its author is extremely appealing.''         Ms. Harrison was converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses faith by her mother when she was 9; she went door to door carrying its message. At 19, she went to live and work at its world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights.         After three years there, she renounced the faith and left.         ''Visions of Glory'' mixes her autobiography with detailed historical research. She portrays the religion as racist, sexist and totalitarian, but also details members' kindness to one another, their care for the elderly and their courage in the face of persecution.         Barbara Grizzuti was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 14, 1934. She grew up in various Brooklyn neighborhoods, mainly Bensonhurst. Her father, a printer, and her brother, Richard, did not become Jehovah's Witnesses, creating a deep fault line in the household. She wrote of an extremely disorganized family, and of a father who sexually abused her and once tried to kill her.         As a young teenager, Barbara already knew she wanted to be a writer. When asked in an interview in ''Contemporary Authors'' how she could reconcile this ambition with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses, she suggested that the religion's images of the watery creation of the world and its imminent bloody destruction stimulated her imagination.         ''I think the two things were going on simultaneously: the religion encouraged something it was bound to squash,'' she said.         In her autobiography, ''An Accidental Autobiography'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), she wrote, ''I read Sartre in my late teens and made the mistake of taking him seriously.''         After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, she moved to the East Village and worked as a secretary at a publishing house and at the American Committee on Africa. There she met W. Dale Harrison, whom she married. He took a job with CARE, and they lived in Libya, India and Guatemala.         They returned to Brooklyn with their two children, and she wrote that she thought of herself as ''one of those furtive, silly housewives with a novel under her apron.''         Her first book, ''Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School'' (Liveright, 1969), grew out of the children's experiences with efforts to quell sexism at what was then the Woodward Park School in Brooklyn.         The Harrisons divorced in 1968 after eight years of marriage.         Ms. Harrison was an early writer for Ms. Magazine. Often described as a gifted interviewer, she contributed to many other national magazines and newspapers. She was noted for her humor and her strong opinions; she once called the highly regarded novelist Joan Didion a ''neurasthenic Cher.''         Her other books included ''Italian Days'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989), an impressionistic and literary travel book about Italy that won the American Book Award, and a novel, ''Foreign Bodies'' (Doubleday, 1984).         Ms. Harrison is survived by her daughter, who lives in Bethlehem, Conn., and her son, Josh Harrison of Manhattan.         Her daughter said her mother returned to the religion of her early childhood, Roman Catholicism, in her 40's, partly as a result of interviewing Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and partly because she hoped to meet in heaven the high school English teacher who had first appreciated her writing.       
         Helen Levitov Sobell, a voice in the struggle to spare Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and free their co-defendant, Morton Sobell, her husband, died on April 15 in Redwood City, Calif. She was 84.         She had long been in declining health, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Sydney Gurewitz Clemens.         The espionage trial of the Rosenbergs prompted an international furor that their execution in 1953 did not still. Mr. Sobell, who did not testify, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was released in 1969 and lives in San Francisco.         Morton and Helen Sobell had fled to Mexico in 1950 with their infant son, Mark, and her daughter, trying to find passage to Europe but lacking passports. They were abducted by armed men, taken to the United States border and turned over to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         From then on, Mrs. Sobell pursued worldwide pleas, first for the Rosenbergs' lives and then for Mr. Sobell, who always denied any knowledge of a spy ring. He maintained that he had taken his family to Mexico because he had lied about belonging to the Communist Party.         Mrs. Sobell spoke at rallies in the United States and abroad. She lobbied the powerful, directed picket lines and coordinated a large network of volunteers and supporters, including Pablo Picasso and Bertrand Russell.         Documents since obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that she was singled out for harassment in the McCarthy era because Director J. Edgar Hoover of the F.B.I. was worried about the Sobell clamor. The authorities also suspected Mrs. Sobell of being the real cause of their inability to exact information about espionage from her husband.         After Mr. Sobell was released from prison, Mrs. Sobell studied system theory and received a doctorate in computer education from Teachers College at Columbia University in 1972. The marriage ended in 1980.         Helen Levitov Sobell was born in Washington and trained as a teacher at Wilson Teachers College in Washington. In World War II she worked at the Bureau of Standards as a spectrometer technician. In 1945 she divorced her first husband, Clarence D. Gurewitz, and married Mr. Sobell.         Both then worked at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, N.Y., while she studied physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. After moving to New York City in 1947, she was awarded a master's degree at Columbia in 1950.         Besides her daughter, a resident of San Francisco, and her son, who lives in Menlo Park, N.J., Mrs. Sobell is survived by a sister, Dr. Edith Garduk of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, David Levitov of Silver Spring, Md., and Joseph Levitov of Boca Raton, Fla.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         María Félix, the Mexican film star whose extraordinary beauty and force of personality made her a living myth to Mexicans and a symbol of glamour and sophistication to fans throughout the world, died yesterday at her home in Mexico City. She was 87.         Ms. Félix made 47 films during a tumultuous film career that began with overnight stardom in the early 1940's and raged on for three decades. During the entire period, she reigned as the supreme goddess of Spanish-language cinema.         Ms. Félix made films in Mexico, Spain, Italy, France and Argentina, portraying figures like a belly dancer, a brothel keeper, a teacher, a soldier, a cabaret singer and a man-eating Roman empress. She was cast so often as a notorious or strong-minded woman that those characteristics became indistinguishable from her own tempestuous personality in the minds of many fans, especially after the success of early films with titles like ''Woman Without a Soul.''         She did not speak English and never accepted work in Hollywood, where directors offered her only stereotyped parts as a Latin spitfire.         She married four times, divorcing her first husband, a cosmetics salesman, and her second, Agustín Lara, who was Mexico's greatest songwriter. She was widowed by her third husband, Jorge Negrete, the country's leading male star, and by her last, Alex Berger, a French financier.         ''Many feminine images have ignited the fantasy of the Mexicans,'' wrote Octavio Paz, Mexico's Nobel Prize-winning poet, in a 1992 essay on cinema and myth-making. Some, he said, like the Virgen de Guadalupe, are sweet, maternal figures, and others, like the Malinche, Cortés's indigenous concubine, are inscrutable.         ''But the myth of María Félix is different,'' Mr. Paz declared. ''María Félix is a woman -- such a woman -- with the audacity to defy the ideas machos have constructed of what a woman should be. She's free like the wind, she disperses the clouds, or illuminates them with the lightning flash of her gaze.''         Ms. Félix's best movies were filmed in the 1940's, when she was a dominant figure in the golden age of Mexican cinema. She became so powerful that she exerted great influence over lighting, camera angles, scenario, wardrobe and other aspects of films usually reserved for producers and directors. In Europe and in Mexico during the 1950's, she worked with eminent European directors like Jean Renoir and Luis Buñuel and leading men like Gérard Philipe and Yves Montand.         Ms. Félix was born María de los Ángeles Félix Guereña, on May 4, 1914, in Álamos, Sonora, according to the birth certificate discovered by Paco Ignacio Taibo, the author of ''La Doña,'' a 1985 biography of Ms. Félix (Mexico City: Planeta).         Her father, Bernardo Félix, was a merchant turned civil servant and an imperious dictator over his middle-class household. Ms. Félix described him in 1993 interviews with Enrique Krauze, the Mexican historian, as a classic macho who hid his emotions, beat his sons and ignored his daughters. Her mother, Josefina Guereña, bore 16 children, of which 12 survived. María was the ninth.         When Ms. Félix was about 10, her family moved to Guadalajara, where she was expelled from several schools. But she made it to the university, where she was elected Queen of the Carnival. Enrique Álvarez, a traveling salesman proposed to her after demonstrating his Max Factor cosmetics to her, and she agreed to marry him. Her only son, Enrique Álvarez Félix, was born in 1934 when she was not quite 20. He died in 1996.         Her husband was jealous and rough. Ms. Félix became unhappy, and after a brief affair with a college student, obtained a divorce.         After she moved to Mexico City, a minor film director, Fernando Palacios, saw her on the street, persuaded her to consider acting, and helped her obtain her first part, in the 1942 film ''El Peñón de las Ánimas,'' or ''The Rock of the Spirits,'' a rural melodrama modeled loosely on ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Critics have lampooned the movie over the years for its histrionics; in its climactic scene, Ms. Félix is shot and hurled from the top of a tall pine. But the part immediately thrust Ms. Félix to the summit of Mexican cinema.         ''This was the appearance of a personality who had nothing to do with the rest of Mexican cinema,'' Mr. Taibo wrote in his biography. ''María was not only a singular beauty. She had a lofty bearing that stood in complete contrast to the traditionally submissive Mexican actress.''         In the years that remained in the decade, Ms. Félix filmed 19 movies that include her classic portrayals.         ''Enamorada,'' filmed in 1946, was the first of several in which she was teamed with the director Emilio Fernández and the cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, and which critics have judged her best work. In the film, a romantic comedy, Ms. Félix played the daughter of a wealthy patriarch in a Mexican town seized by revolutionary troops. The occupying general, who falls in love with her, was played by Pedro Armendáriz, a dashing Mexican star.         Ms. Félix never studied acting in any formal sense, but improvised her own approach to movie parts and to the cameraman's lens. ''She was never interested in a realistic style of acting,'' said Manuel Puig, the Argentine author, in 1990. ''Instead, she worked out a highly personal way of moving and talking.''         Adding to Ms. Félix's mythic stature was a romantic life that brought marriage or liaison with many leading men of her era and courtship by numerous powerful but eventually disappointed pretenders.         In 1943 she married Mr. Lara, Mexico's national musician-poet, a sensational union that drove newspapers wild, especially after Mr. Lara wrote Ms. Félix a song, ''María Bonita,'' or ''Pretty Maria,'' which became fabulously popular. The marriage was to Mexicans what Marilyn Monroe's marriage to Joe DiMaggio was to Americans.         But the marriage began to chafe under Mr. Lara's jealous eye. They divorced in 1947, and she traveled to Spain to film her first European movie, ''Mare Nostrum,'' in which she played a Latin Mata Hari.         Mr. Lara was only one of dozens of eminent men who fell in love with Ms. Félix, some ridiculously.         The artist Diego Rivera became so obsessed that he dedicated an entire period to painting her portraits. One, in which he dressed her in a sheer white gown revealing her silky figure, he titled ''Very Bad.'' A photo of the two at the time shows him, fat and froglike, embracing her as she, looking cool and gorgeous, stares away in bemused boredom.         ''He threw himself on me like misery throws itself on the poor,'' Ms. Félix recalled later.         Ms. Félix first met Mr. Negrete, who would be her third husband, filming ''The Rock of the Spirits.'' Their 1952 wedding was a national event, but the marriage was shortlived. Mr. Negrete's health was failing, and Ms. Félix, called again to film in Europe, left him behind. When word came that Mr. Negrete was stricken in Hollywood, she flew 36 hours west to his bedside, and accompanied his coffin back to Mexico City, where a line of mourners 10 miles long were waiting.         Starting in 1948 Ms. Félix began a love affair with Europe, filming six straight films in Spain, France and Italy, and a seventh in Argentina.         Blocked from a Hollywood career by her inability to speak English, Ms. Félix was determined to make movies in France. She devoted eight hours a day to studying French, putting a pencil under her tongue to practice her pronunciation.         Her French movies included ''La Belle Otero,'' directed by Richard Pottier in 1954, in which she played a turn-of-the-century courtesan, and ''French Cancan,'' directed by Jean Renoir later that same year.         Her last movie, ''La Generala,'' in which she played the sister of a rebel general who takes up arms when she sees the revolution betrayed, was released in 1970.         One of Ms. Félix's longest and most disagreeable conflicts involved Carlos Fuentes, the Mexican writer, who modeled the main character of a 1967 novel, ''Zona Sagrada'', on Ms. Félix, portraying her as a pathetic egomaniac. Fifteen years later, Mr. Fuentes again publicly dissected Ms. Félix's personality, along with that of another major Mexican actress, Dolores del Rio, in a play, ''Orchids in the Moonlight.''         Ms. Félix was bitter. ''Not only did he steal my soul in his novel, but he also attacked me and Dolores del Rio in his play,'' she told an interviewer from Vanity Fair magazine in 1990.         ''María has a mythic quality, and she's a great national symbol,'' Mr. Fuentes responded. ''That's why I could dare to have a character impersonate her: only a myth can inspire imitation.''         Yesterday, in learning of her death, Mr. Fuentes said: ''She was a goddess. There were no eyes in the world more beautiful than María Félix's. She was a magnificent character, and, along with Dolores del Rio, the greatest beauty of the golden age of the Mexican cinema.''       
         Beverly Bower, an operatic soprano who sang the lead at the first performance in the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, died on March 24 at her home in Washington Township, N.J. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bower was born in Olean, N.Y., and began her career singing on radio and television, including on Jack Paar's ''Tonight'' show.         She joined the New York City Opera in 1956. Her roles there included Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Micaëla in ''Carmen'' and the title character in Gian Carlo Menotti's ''Amelia Goes to the Ball.''         Her debut at the Met was as Ortlinde, a Valkyrie in Wagner's ''Walküre,'' in 1965. She also sang Musetta in ''La Bohème,'' Senta in ''Der Fliegende Holländer'' and Micaëla at the Met.         On April 11, 1966, Ms. Bower sang in the first public performance at the new Met, an acoustical test run, Puccini's ''Fanciulla del West,'' which was attended by 3,000 high school students. Ms. Bower sang the role of Minnie. The program began with the national anthem followed by a series of sound tests that included a blast from a gun and a loud chord from the orchestra.         Ms. Bower also sang at the Vienna State Opera under Herbert von Karajan in 1963.         After she retired, she joined the board of the New Jersey Pro Arte Chorale and was a voice teacher.         Ms. Bower is survived by her husband, John, and a son, Mark, both of Washington Township.       
         A. J. Levinson, who pressed a national campaign to improve what she called ''the quality of death'' by promoting living wills, and who educated both professionals and the public on ways to bring dignity to dying, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was widespread cancer, her daughter Martha Levinson said.         Ann-Jane Levinson (she preferred A. J.) was executive director of Concern for Dying for 11 years beginning in 1976, a period in which thorny cases like that of Karen Ann Quinlan, who spent years on life support equipment, provoked deep questioning about how people die. Ms. Levinson's message was that family doctors, nurses and others should strive to honor the dying person's wishes.         The group, which is defunct, grew out of the Euthanasia Educational Council. Perhaps its most important accomplishment was helping develop and promote the concept of the living will. Such a will is a formal document that permits a person to record desires for how the end of life should be handled. Living wills often express the determination to die a ''natural death'' and not to have life extended artificially by life support equipment.         These documents, which millions of people in many states have prepared, can call for ending medical procedures that have been instituted in the patient's behalf. Most deputize a relative or an acquaintance to act if the patient is incapacitated, and health care proxies, their formal name, are recognized as binding in many states.         The organization sent out more than seven million forms for living wills to groups and individuals all over the country. After a single mention in an Ann Landers column, hundreds of thousands of requests poured in.         The group also advocated allowing people to have ample pain medication at the end of their lives, if they wished.         ''Doctors are afraid of things like addiction and overdosing when that isn't the primary concern to a terminal patient in severe pain,'' Ms. Levinson said in an interview in 1985 with The Record, a newspaper in northern New Jersey.         But she denounced mercy killing.         ''I don't think society should be in the business of killing people,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ''I don't think killing is a person's right.''         She was born in Boston on Jan. 7, 1929. Her mother drove an ambulance in France during World War I. Her father, Dr. John Rock, was a professor at Harvard Medical School who helped develop the first birth control pill. Earlier, he had angered the Roman Catholic Church by performing abortions.         She graduated from the Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., and Bryn Mawr, where she majored in history. She then briefly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, but never told her family what she did.         She had two daughters, Martha Levinson and Kate Ewing, both of Manhattan, and a son, Paul T. Levinson of Milton, Mass., with her husband, Henry W. Levinson, who also survives, as does a sister, Rachel Achenbach of Boxford, Mass.         In 1957, she did graduate work in psychology and sociology at Columbia, then taught at several private schools in Manhattan. She introduced courses on sex education, drug abuse and skills for urban living.         Katherine Strauss Mali, president of Concern for Dying, hired her as executive director in 1976. Martha Levinson said her mother was motivated by the vastly different experiences of two dying relatives: her brother died alone and miserable with hospital officials barring visits; while her mother died at home surrounded by loved ones.         Much of her work involved bringing people from different disciplines together in seminars about death and dying. She appeared on national television programs like ''The Tonight Show.'' She had her children stuff living wills into envelopes for mailing.         She formally retired in 1988, after suffering a debilitating stroke the previous year. She had a living will.         Her husband said she did not like death. She was interested in the conduct of living people.         Correction:  May 4, 2002, Saturday  An obituary on Wednesday about A. J. Levinson, an advocate for living wills, included a family member's erroneous reference to the work of her father, Dr. John Rock, in the field of birth control. The family says Dr. Rock, a professor at Harvard Medical School who helped develop the birth control pill, did not perform abortions.       
         Lenore Patricia Kroh Freudenheim, a flower arranging expert and author of four books on the subject, died on April 26 in Longboat Key, Fla. She was 97 and lived in Longboat Key.         The holder of diplomas from four schools of Japanese flower arranging, she taught and lectured widely and explained her philosophy in ''A Japanese Flower Arranging Notebook,'' published in 1963. Her books, all published by Doubleday & Company under her maiden name, Patricia Kroh, also included ''Design With Flowers Unlimited'' (1959), ''Contemporary Table Settings'' (1966) and ''A New World of Flower Arrangement'' (1969).         She is survived by a daughter, Diane Freudenheim Lange of Danbury, Conn.; a son, Milton, who is a reporter for The New York Times; seven grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Kimberly Miles, recipient of a lung transplant in November 2000 in an unusual operation in which her sister and a friend donated parts of their lungs, died on Monday in Minneapolis. She was 33.         The cause was cystic fibrosis.         Ms. Miles was born with the disease, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, digestive system and other organs. The average age at death is about 30.         Ms. Miles still managed a full life in her hometown, Black River Falls, Wis., where she lived with her son, Cole, 9, and his father, Larry Schultz. By 2000, she was spending much time in the hospital with lung infections. Doctors said they did not believe that she would live long enough to receive a transplant from a cadaver.         Ms. Miles's sister Tammy Hoff and a friend, DorMae Gebhardt, both in their early 30's with families of their own, offered to be donors.         Ms. Miles's surgeon, Dr. Soon Park, had performed lung transplants from living donors, but had never encountered a case in which a donor was not a blood relative, he said. Of 956 lung transplants performed in 2000, just 15 came from living donors.         Dr. Park predicted that after the surgery Ms. Miles would walk and probably even run.         The operations were described in a front-page article about donors of living organs in The New York Times on June 24, 2001, and they were the subject of ''A Gift of Life,'' a Science Times television program that was first shown on June 26, 2001, on the National Geographic Channel.         Technically, Ms. Miles's transplant was successful, and her new lungs, consisting of a lobe of one lung from each donor, worked well.         But she soon developed digestive problems, probably from the cystic fibrosis. She also began to retain fluid and became so swollen that she had difficulty getting around.         Ms. Hoff said her sister fought hard to overcome the problems, but finally asked not to be put on a respirator again or subjected to more invasive procedures.         She died at Fairview University Hospital surrounded by family members and Dr. Park.         ''We had no cure for her,'' Dr. Park said.         He said that ultimately he did not think that the transplant improved Ms. Miles's quality of life and that if he had foreseen the course of her disease, he would probably not have performed the operations.         But there was no way to predict her outcome, he added. The University of Minnesota, which has performed five lung transplants using living donors, will continue its plan of performing a total of 10 such operations and then evaluating the results, Dr. Park said, ''to see whether this is a responsible thing to do or not.''         Three of the five recipients are doing well. One is a young woman with cystic fibrosis, he said.         Ms. Gebhardt and Ms. Hoff said they had no regrets about the operations.         ''I guess it works on some and not on others,'' Ms. Gebhardt said. ''We knew that from the start. It was a chance everybody took. We tried, and it's all we could do.''         Ms. Hoff said, ''The only thing I regret is her not getting quality of life out of it.''         In addition to her son, his father and Ms. Hoff, Ms. Miles is survived by her parents, Wayne and Liz Miles, and another sister, Debra Bloczynski.       
         Rose Ellis Matzkin, national president of Hadassah, the women's Zionist organization of America, from 1972 to 1976, died on Monday in a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 88.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Matzkin was the daughter of Louis and Jennie Cohen. She attended New Haven State Teachers College, taught for a time and went on to hold a number of posts in Hadassah and in other Zionist organizations.         She married Dr. Max N. Matzkin in 1934; he died before her.         Survivors include a son, Dr. Michael Matzkin; a daughter, Hannah Lavine; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Sharon L. Monsky, a scleroderma sufferer who founded an organization that raised millions of dollars to look for a cure for the disease, died on Saturday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 48 and lived in Santa Barbara.         The cause was systemic scleroderma, said Charles Spaulding, a vice president of the organization, the Scleroderma Research Foundation, which Ms. Monsky founded in 1987.         Ms. Monsky had systemic scleroderma, a chronic and painful disease afflicting the connective tissues, for two decades. She was the foundation's chairman and chief executive until she died.         ''She was a leader in raising awareness and funding in search of a cure for scleroderma,'' said Dr. M. Kari Connolly, a professor of dermatology and medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, who has been doing research about scleroderma for 10 years.         The struggle for awareness and money encountered problems. Ms. Monsky said in a 1990 interview with The New York Times: ''It's a hard one to sell. It's a mysterious disease. It's an ugly disease. And there are no scleroderma poster children to help.''         In the early 1980's, when she found out that she had scleroderma, which hardens the skin and internal organs, Ms. Monsky was given only two years to live. But as she lived on, she decided to create the foundation.         She had a master's degree in business administration and had become a highly regarded management consultant with McKinsey & Company, which she had to leave in 1985 after her health deteriorated. She applied her business expertise to the foundation.         Besides corporate donors, celebrities in the performing arts were persuaded to donate time and money to the cause.         Ms. Monsky's activities generated more than $14 million for research and helped expand understanding of the disease. Money she disbursed for basic medical research on scleroderma led to the publication of scientific articles exploring potential cures. Her work also helped make scleroderma better known.         The foundation's activities include operating two sites for research on the disease, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of California at San Francisco. The foundation also has adjunct laboratories at Ohio State, Stanford and Duke Universities.         Born in Omaha, Ms. Monsky was a top amateur figure skater as a teenager. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., and a master's degree in business administration from Stanford.         She was separated from her husband, Mark Scher.         She is survived by her mother, Ramelle Monsky of Palm Desert, Calif.; a son, Max, and two daughters, Samantha and Montana, all of Santa Barbara; a sister, Robin Monsky of Chicago; and a brother, Henry Monsky of Omaha.       
         Niki de Saint Phalle, a Franco-American artist internationally known for her colorful, monumental, cartoonlike sculptures and environments, died on Tuesday in San Diego, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was pulmonary failure after an illness of several months, said Harry Mathews, the writer and her first husband.         A heroine to feminism before the modern movement even emerged, Ms. de Saint Phalle first made her mark in Paris in the early 60's when she was associated with the Nouveaux Réalistes, a group of avant-gardists that included the sculptors Christo, Arman and Jean Tinguely. Their antic, absurdist works challenged conventional ideas about art-making in ways that echoed the earlier Dada movement.         Ms. de Saint Phalle became notorious for what she called ''target paintings,'' at which darts were thrown, and then for actual ''shooting paintings'' and sculptures. In galleries, she would use a .22-caliber rifle to shoot at plaster sculptures in which she had embedded bags of paint, causing color to splatter all over.         Ms. de Saint Phalle went on to produce a far different kind of art, an amalgam of Pop, Surrealism, Folk and outsider art that she prolifically realized in sculptures, paintings, prints and large public installations. Inspired in the mid-60's by a visit from the wife of Larry Rivers, Clarice Rivers, who was then pregnant, Ms. de Saint Phalle created the first of what would become an extensive population of ''Nanas.'' (Nana is a mildly rude French term for woman, comparable to broad.) They were bulbous, archetypal maternal figures like Mexican piñatas painted in bold colors and decorated with crisp, cartoon outlines.         In contrast with the aggressive Conceptualism of her early performance works, the art for which she became best known seemed to flow from an endlessly fertile, visionary imagination.         The Nanas gave birth to legions of fanciful humanoids, animals, plants and monsters and a trend away from the refinement of individual objects toward the creation of whole, fantastic worlds that would be most fully achieved in ambitious public works like Surrealistic amusement parks. Made of cement and produced on a gigantic scale, the Nanas became houses that visitors could enter, and surrounding grounds became teeming, part-organic, part-architectural mazes. At once avant-garde and populist, Ms. de Saint Phalle's art had the unusual ability to appeal to a wide range of viewers, from art-world professionals to children.         In the late 1970's, on acreage in southwestern Tuscany made available by wealthy friends, Ms. de Saint Phalle began her most ambitious project, a sprawling sculpture garden featuring 22 large sculptures based on the fortune-telling Tarot cards. With its wildly grotesque forms decorated by ceramic tiles, glass and mirrors, it calls to mind the architecture of Antonio Gaudí, whose work made a lasting impression on Ms. de Saint Phalle when she first encountered it in the 1950's. Financing it in part through the sale of a perfume called Niki de Saint Phalle, which she created for the Jacqueline Cochran company, Ms. de Saint Phalle worked on the Tarot Garden for 20 years. It opened to the public in 1998.         Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle was born into a wealthy family on Oct. 29, 1930, at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, but was partly raised in New York, where her parents moved after the crash of 1929, and educated at the Brearley School, among several others. She told of being thrown out of Brearley for painting the fig leaves on the school artworks red.         At 18 she eloped with Mr. Mathews, and two years later the couple moved to France, where she began to paint after a nervous breakdown at age 23. She was mostly a self-taught artist. Her first solo exhibition took place in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 1956, but she did not begin to show her work regularly until 1961.         Divorced from Mr. Mathews in 1960, she began a relationship with Jean Tinguely, the Swiss sculptor known for his kinetic, mechanical sculptures. They were married in 1971 and she collaborated with him on many projects. Although they lived separately after their marriage, their partnership lasted until his death in 1991. Ms. de Saint Phalle returned to the United States in 1994 to settle in La Jolla, in San Diego, partly because of her frail health.         In addition to producing public works in cities from Jerusalem to San Diego, Ms. de Saint Phalle had many museum exhibitions. The Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts in New York assembled her first American retrospective in 1987, and a larger retrospective was organized by the Kunst und Austellunghalle in Bonn in 1992. In 1994, an institution dedicated to her work, the Niki Museum, opened in Nasu, Japan. In 2000 she won a $140,000 Praemium Imperiale Award given by the Japan Art Association.         Ms. de Saint Phalle is survived by a brother, John de Saint Phalle, of Florida; a daughter, Laura Duke, of Paris; a son, Philip Mathews, of New York; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Zypora Spaisman, who did everything to keep Yiddish theater alive, from producing plays to selling tickets to sweeping floors to her great love, acting (including not a few Jewish-mother roles), died on May 18 in Manhattan. She was 86.         The Yiddish stage was the center of Mrs. Spaisman's life, from her girlhood in Poland to a Soviet labor camp to Paris and Montreal and finally to New York, where she became a principal force in maintaining the nation's only surviving Yiddish theater, the Folksbiene (People's Stage). She seems never to have made a penny for her efforts.         ''Nearly single-handedly, she led the pack in the fight to keep Yiddish theater going,'' said Eleanor Reissa, the artistic director of the Folksbiene, for which Mrs. Spaisman was once in charge of productions.         In 1914 there were 14 Yiddish theaters in New York, and avant-garde movements like naturalism, expressionism and Stanislavsky's Method often found their first expression there. But the combined effects of the Holocaust, the diffusion and assimilation of American Jews and the aging of the immigrant population gnawed away at audience numbers.         A bitter, often-quoted joke in Yiddish circles is that each time one of the Yiddish theater's remaining audience members dies, a seat is removed so it will not look empty. But dwindling numbers only heightened Mrs. Spaisman's determination.         ''My whole life has been about preserving the Yiddish language,'' she said in an interview. ''Hitler didn't kill it. Neither did Stalin.''         Zypora Tanenbaum was born in Lublin, Poland, on Jan. 2, 1916. By the time she was 10, she was participating in town and school dramatic presentations in both Polish and Yiddish, a language that mingles Old High German and Hebrew, with Slavic and Romance elements.         She graduated from nursing school, became a midwife in 1933, and married Joseph Spaisman in 1938. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, she saw her sister shot. The Spaismans fled to the Russian part of Poland, and from there were taken to a labor camp in the Urals.         Mrs. Spaisman delivered more than 1,000 babies while in the camp. Each Sunday, she would organize a Yiddish theatrical presentation in a different barracks, said her son, Ben-Ami, who survives her, along with his two children.         When Mrs. Spaisman returned to Poland after the war, she learned that all the members of her family were dead, as were most of the country's Jews. She acted in the Yiddish theater in Lodz, working with the great Yiddish comedians Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Shumakher. In Paris and Montreal, where she waited with her husband and son for permission to enter the United States, she also worked in the theater.         The Spaismans came to New York in 1955, and she sought stage work at the Hebrew Actors Union, but was rebuffed. So she went to the Folksbiene, which she had heard about from a Polish director.         The company, which opened in 1915, is now the oldest continually performing Yiddish theater in the world. Although Mrs. Spaisman never worked with the renowned actress Molly Picon, she appeared with many of the other luminaries of the Yiddish stage.         She often created characters that combined surface humor with inner wisdom. The publication Back Stage called her ''the grande dame,'' and The Jewish Week referred to her as ''a national treasure.'' Reviewing ''The Land of Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1989, Richard F. Shepard called her ''the mistress of the glumly comic look and acerbic tongue.''         Mrs. Spaisman's fans seemed to respond to her performances as if the characters she played were real. Once when she portrayed a shabbily dressed town gossip, two women met her outside the theater with new stockings and blouses.         ''You make us laugh, you make us cry,'' they told Mrs. Spaisman, according to The Jerusalem Post. ''You're so poorly dressed, we brought you these things.''         In 1989, Mrs. Spaisman appeared in the movie ''Enemies: A Love Story,'' directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver. During her acting career, she won an Obie Award, a Drama Desk Award and a New York City People's Choice Award.         Mrs. Spaisman, who lived in Manhattan, supported herself by working as a recreation director at the Jewish Institute for Geriatric Care, first in Manhattan and then in New Hyde Park, N.Y. On a typical day, she left for work at 7 and returned at 5 to cook dinner for her husband and son. Then she went to rehearsal. Performances were on weekends.         Mr. Spaisman died in 1997. In 1998, Mrs. Spaisman was shocked when the Folksbiene board eliminated her position -- executive producer -- to hire younger producers attuned to younger audiences. She refused to retire gracefully.         ''They wanted to give me a nice party,'' she said in an interview in The Times in 2000, ''to get money in my name and give it to the Folksbiene. And I should step down. I have to be such an idiot?''         Ms. Reissa said she wanted Mrs. Spaisman to remain as a valuable consultant; Mrs. Spaisman refused. With her death, the three people who long steered the Folksbiene are now gone: Benjamin Schechter, managing director, died in 1994, and Morris Adler, president, died in December at 107.         After what Mrs. Spaisman insisted on viewing as her dismissal, she took the Folksbiene's mailing list with her and started a new Yiddish theater company, the Yiddish Public Theater.         She cast herself in a starring role in November 2000 in its first and so far only production: ''Grine Felder'' (''Green Fields''). A review in Back Stage said that in her role as a mother, she ''proves that passing time cannot deter a real trouper.''       
         Lois Gould, a best-selling novelist, essayist and memoirist known for her acutely observed portrayals of the emotional complexities of women's lives, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         She had fought cancer for some time, said her son, Anthony C. Gould.         Ms. Gould was perhaps best known for her debut novel, ''Such Good Friends'' (1970, Random House). Partly autobiographical, the book is about a woman who learns of her husband's wide-ranging infidelities only as he is dying in a hospital. It spent seven weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and was released as a film the next year.         Most recently, Ms. Gould published a critically praised memoir, ''Mommy Dressing: A Love Story, After a Fashion'' (Anchor/Doubleday, 1998), a cleareyed recollection of life with her glamorous, remote mother, the fashion designer Jo Copeland. Reviewing the memoir in The New York Times Book Review, Margo Jefferson wrote that ''dispassionate compassion is a very moving quality, and it marks 'Mommy Dressing' from beginning to end.''         As an essayist and critic, Ms. Gould was a frequent contributor to The Times, writing the inaugural Hers column in 1977 and many thereafter. Her subjects included sexual politics, family and the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between men's and women's attitudes toward emotionally laden topics like adultery, eroticism and divorce.         Ms. Gould was born Lois Regensburg to parents ensconced in the Stork Club set of Manhattan. Her father, Edward J. Regensburg Jr., a debonair cigar manufacturer, left the family, ''whistling,'' she would write, when Lois was 3. Her mother, whose designs were prized by the social lights of New York, Hollywood and Europe, was consumed by her passion for her work and her distaste for her children.         As parties rustled silkenly in Jo Copeland's Park Avenue living room -- guests might include Joan Crawford or Tyrone Power -- Lois and her brother were expected to remain in their rooms with their supper trays, blissfully unseen and unheard.         After graduating from Wellesley, Ms. Gould reported on the criminal courts for The Long Island Star-Journal, a newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that has since folded. She became an editor on several national magazines and served as executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal. She married Philip Benjamin, a novelist and a reporter for The Times, in 1955.         In 1966 her husband died suddenly after surgery, leaving her with two boys. Among her husband's papers, Ms. Gould found a diary written in code. She cracked the code and discovered a catalog of his extramarital liaisons, many with her friends. The experience provided a foundation for her first novel.         In ''Such Good Friends,'' Julie Messinger, a young mother, uncovers a similar diary as her husband lies dying. Ms. Gould's novel offered a raw, darkly comic portrait of Julie's emotional life -- her grief, rage, amphetamine popping and suicidal depression -- along with frank depictions of her sexual life, which ran the gamut from quiet marital frustration to ardent masturbation.         The book caused a sensation in 1970, when Americans were still struggling to comprehend the social upheavals set in motion by the women's movement.         Likening Julie to a female Alex Portnoy, Saturday Review said: ''What some men find offensive in 'Such Good Friends' is just this kind of intimate disclosure'': the passage under critical scrutiny involved reading Krafft-Ebing in bed while eating Sara Lee fudge cake. The review continued, ''Women aren't supposed to have equal sexual and human rights -- and talk about them as openly as men.''         In 1967 Ms. Gould married the psychiatrist Robert E. Gould. (Her sons, whom Dr. Gould adopted, took his surname.) Dr. Gould died n 1998; Ms. Gould's son Roger V. Gould, a sociologist at Yale University, died of leukemia at 39 on April 29. Ms. Gould is survived by her son Anthony, of Manhattan, and her brother, Anthony Regensburg, of Camden, Me., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Among Ms. Gould's other books are the novels ''Necessary Objects'' (1972), ''Final Analysis'' (1974), ''A Sea Change'' (1976) and ''La Presidenta'' (1981) and the essay collection ''Not Responsible for Personal Articles'' (1978).         If Ms. Gould was known primarily for her knife-edged fictional depictions of marriage and its discontents, she was an equally incisive observer of human connection -- and disconnection -- in her nonfiction.         In an evocative passage about her mother, she recalled a bittersweet childhood ritual: watching Jo Copeland at her vanity table as she prepared for an evening out.         ''It seemed to me an ark of some covenant, with hidden doors that swung open to reveal fragrant jars and beautiful bottles, each of which held other secrets,'' she wrote.         ''Everything I knew about my mother, Jo Copeland, happened right there,'' Ms. Gould continued. ''For what I knew about her was only the dressing. Nothing of the rest of her life was visible to me. Unless the dressing was, in fact, the life.''       
         Edna Mae Robinson, the Cotton Club star who was once married to the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, died in her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 86.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son, Ray Robinson II.         Ernestine Holly was born in 1915 to a prominent Miami family, and moved to New York City when she was 5.         Precocious on and off the dance floor, she graduated from high school at 14 and found work as a dancer, touring Europe with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway in the 1930's. At the Cotton Club, in Harlem, she was known for dancing atop an enormous drum.         In 1940, she met her future husband -- also a local celebrity -- silently and anonymously at a local pool.         The up-and-coming boxer Walker Smith Jr. -- soon to be nicknamed Sugar Ray Robinson after his borrowed identification card and smooth fighting style -- could not help noticing the preening young woman as she sauntered poolside. So he pushed her in.         Edna Mae, who could not swim, was not impressed. But she gave Mr. Robinson a second chance at a Harlem nightclub some months later, when they were formally introduced. They were married in 1943.         During their 19-year marriage, while Mr. Robinson became a five-time world middleweight champion, Mrs. Robinson stopped performing to travel with her husband. She encouraged his natty style and shared his penchant for flash as they spent and gave away Mr. Robinson's $4 million in winnings. (The couple drove a flamingo-pink Cadillac.)         In the 1950's, they owned businesses covering much of Seventh Avenue from 123rd to 124th streets, including Edna Mae's Lingerie Shop and Sugar Ray's Cafe.         After the couple divorced in 1962, she revived her show business career, appearing in television variety shows, cabaret productions and, briefly, on the New York stage in an all-black version of ''Born Yesterday.'' She never remarried.         Mr. Robinson died in 1989. Mrs. Robinson is survived by her son and five grandchildren.       
         Prof. Florence G. Roswell, who spent more than half a century teaching and writing, particularly about ways to diagnose and overcome reading disabilities, died May 4 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 97.         A former director of the reading clinic at the City College of New York, she remained active into her 90's, with several of her books and manuals published or reissued within the last few years.         She worked with Dr. Jeanne S. Chall, another leading expert on teaching children to read, to devise instructional materials to guide teachers. First published in the 1950's, these materials had a revival in the 1990's and remain in print. Dr. Chall died in 1999.         In 1997, Educators Publishing Company reissued the ''Roswell-Chall Auditory Blending Test,'' and the ''Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Test of Word Analysis Skills.''         Florence Garfunkel Roswell was born in Manhattan in June 1904. She entered New York University at 16, majoring in English literature; she graduated in 1924.         She taught second grade for several years while taking graduate education courses at Teachers College. When children in her classroom were having trouble learning to read, she asked them to come to school earlier and stay later to help them catch up.         City College offered her a teaching fellowship in 1942, asking her to test children with various reading problems and to supervise student teachers. At the time, conventional wisdom regarding reading disabilities was that a child's difficulties were rooted in emotional problems, and that not much could be done by the teacher until the problems were addressed.         Based on her experience in testing and teaching poor readers, Professor Roswell took a more positive tack. She concluded that a child's reading deficiencies required special attention regardless of emotional problems. Her views and those of like-minded teachers eventually prevailed. Their stand brought about recognition of distinct disabilities like various kinds of dyslexia.         For teaching reading, she advocated using phonics along with the whole language method, or a system that chiefly exposes students to the sight of words. The dual approach meant that readers could be able to decode sounds and words.         Her first text, ''Reading Disability: A Human Approach,'' was published in the 1960's and had four printings. Most recently she was a co-author of ''Teaching Children to Read, a Step-by-Step Guide for Volunteer Tutors'' (Continental Press, 1998); and ''Creating Successful Readers'' (Riverside, 1994).         Professor Roswell is survived by a son, Dr. Arthur, of Bridgewater, N.J.; a daughter, Elaine Roswell of New Haven; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her husband, David S. Roswell, an economist, died in the 1960's.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Elka Spoerri, an art historian and curator who unlocked the riches of the art of Adolf Wölfli, died May 17 at her home in Bern, Switzerland. She was 77 and lived in Bern and New York.         She died of cancer, said her son, Anselm.         Mrs. Spoerri, who sometimes jokingly referred to herself as ''Mrs. Wölfli,'' was a legend in the world of outsider art. She spent more than 20 years deciphering, transcribing, translating and indexing the often densely interwoven writing, iconography and musical scores of Wölfli, a prolific schizophrenic Swiss laborer. Consigned to Waldau, a psychiatric hospital in Bern, from the age of 30 to his death at 66 in 1930, Wölfli created thousands of drawings and 45 large illustrated books containing a total of nearly 25,000 pages. He was known in Switzerland during his lifetime but subsequently slipped into near oblivion.         Mrs. Spoerri came to Wölfli's work through her husband, Theodor, a psychiatrist at Waldau who, at the invitation of the Swiss curator Harald Szeemann, helped reintroduce Wölfli's work to the art world at Documenta 5 in 1972. But Theodor, a cousin of the artist Daniel Spoerri, died in 1973, and Mrs. Spoerri became the chief guardian and interpreter of Wölfli's art.         In 1975 she became the founding curator of the Adolf Wölfli Foundation at the Kunstmuseum Bern. During the next 20 years her pioneering research broke the code of Wölfli's art and confirmed him as arguably one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Her work contributed to a moment of stunning harmonic convergence in the early 1970's, when the heretofore small outsider-art field was rocked by such discoveries as the work of Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger -- like Wölfli, a universe-forming writer-artist.         Mrs. Spoerri was born Elka Zagaroff in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1924, the daughter of a prominent economist. Her family became refugees in 1939, living in Berlin, southern Germany and Bern. She received most of her education at the University of Bern. Interested in contemporary art, she was co-writer of a lexicon of 20th-century Swiss artists, and over the years she maintained close friendships with artists like Meret Oppenheim, Markus Raetz, Joel Fisher and Joan Jonas.         Once diverted into Wölfli territory, Mrs. Spoerri discovered a vast continent. At the time of her husband's death, almost nothing was known about the contents of Wölfli's books, the bulk of his creation. Mrs. Spoerri parsed the constituent parts of their magnificent illustrations: the self-portraits, madonnas and animal forms and the powerful decorative patterns in which they were enmeshed. More important (and laborious), she also deciphered many of Wölfli's words, converting his partly invented Swiss-German into German and English.         Unraveling Wölfli's complex autobiographical narratives and rhythmic celebratory chants, she separated his real life's story from his imagined one, excavating an artist of extraordinary imagination but also sharp observations, as evidenced by his accounts of his impoverished childhood. It helped, she said, that she had been taught in Old German in elementary school in Bulgaria.         Mrs. Spoerri organized or worked on more than 30 exhibitions of Wölfli's work and edited or contributed to numerous Wölfli publications, including (with Dieter Schwarz) a two-volume version of his 2,970-page autobiography, ''From the Cradle to the Grave,'' and (with Max Wechsler) ''Geographical Book No. 11: Writings, 1912-1913.'' She retired from the Wölfli foundation in 1996 but was a curator, with her successor, Daniel Baumann, of the Wölfli retrospective that will open at the American Museum of Folk Art next January.         In addition to her son, a professor at Rutgers University who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her sister, Radka Donnell, a poet and artist, of Cambridge, Mass., and her brother, Mitko Zagaroff, also of Cambridge, who is a chief engineer for the artists Christo and Jean-Claude.       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Nellie Monk, who as the wife of the jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk was the prime supporter and muse of a troubled genius, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 80.         She had had a cerebral hemorrhage, said Gale Monk, her daughter-in-law.         Of all the stories about jazz musicians who cannot quite handle worldly matters and the companions who manage their lives, the long love affair of Thelonious and Nellie Monk may be the most famous. Monk, a socially awkward eccentric who was absorbed in his art and lived through his imagination, depended on Ms. Monk and relished her company.         In 1957 Monk wrote one of his most beautiful ballads for her, ''Crepuscule With Nellie,'' while Ms. Monk was undergoing surgery for a thyroid disorder.         In the early 1970's, when Monk moved into the large Weehawken, N.J., home of his patron, the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, Ms. Monk moved there with him.         Nellie Smith was born in 1921 in St. Petersburg, Fla. She and her family moved to New York City early in her life, first to Brooklyn and then to the San Juan Hill area of Manhattan, west of Lincoln Center, where Monk's family lived. When she was about 14, she met Monk, who was three years older, on the neighborhood basketball court.         The Monks were together from around 1947 until his death in 1982. She provided financial as well as emotional support, working as a seamstress during World War II in a factory and sporadically making clothes thereafter for her husband and for friends. She never became Monk's manager as such, but she collected money from promoters, paid musicians, made sure band members had airline tickets and even helped Monk get dressed. The 1988 documentary film ''Straight, No Chaser'' showed proof of their mutual devotion, as Mrs. Monk shepherded her husband through airports and hotels.         A small, delicate and sensible woman who contrasted with her bearish, abstracted husband, she was never interviewed at length about her husband; they both kept their family life private. But in Nat Hentoff's book ''The Jazz Life,'' Ms. Monk made revealing comments in discussing her and her husband's clashing sense of home décor.         ''I used to have a phobia about pictures or anything on a wall hanging just a little bit crooked,'' she told Mr. Hentoff. ''Thelonious cured me. He nailed a clock to the wall at a very slight angle, just enough to make me furious. Finally I got used to it. Now anything can hang at any angle and it doesn't bother me at all.'' The story has served ever since as a metaphor for Mr. Monk's relation to the world, and for his music, in which a pretty melody is set slightly askew by dissonance, or a swinging rhythmic phrase is gapped with an irregular rest.         Ms. Monk lived on the Upper West Side, where she had spent most of her adult life. Her daughter, Barbara, known as Boo Boo, died in 1984.         She is survived by her son, Thelonious Monk Jr. (known as T. S. Monk) of South Orange, N.J., a drummer, composer and chairman of the Thelonious Monk Institute; a grandson, Thelonious Monk IV; and a granddaughter, Sierra.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.

By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Elaine Gelman, a leader in the effort to make it legal in New York for specially trained nurses to prescribe drugs and perform other medical functions previously reserved for doctors, died on Tuesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her son Eric Gelman.         Ms. Gelman, a pediatric nurse practitioner, was president of the New York State Coalition of Nurse Practitioners in 1985 and 1988. It was in 1988 that the State Legislature adopted a measure to allow practitioners -- registered nurses who have an additional two years of training -- to make some medical diagnoses and prescribe treatment in collaboration with a physician.         The measure ended a legislative battle that had gone on for almost a decade and had pitted nurse practitioners' organizations against doctors' and nurses' groups. The New York State Nurses Association, which represents registered and practical nurses, objected at the time because, it contended, the bill limited the practice of other nurses by suggesting that without a nurse practitioner's certificate, nurses are not competent to diagnose and treat illnesses.         The New York State Medical Society, representing doctors, had argued that the bill did not ensure adequate supervision by physicians.         Before the bill's passage, Ms. Gelman and other advocates said that expanding the nurse practitioners' role would improve health care in underserved rural and urban areas.         Ms. Gelman was on the New York State Board for Nursing from 1990 to 1996 and was active in the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates/Practitioners. She was executive director of the Coalition of Nurse Practitioners from 1996 to 1998.         Ms. Gelman was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Queens College. She became a registered nurse in 1948 after attending the New York University-Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing. She became a pediatric nurse practitioner in 1975 after attending the Columbia University-Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing.         Besides her son Eric, of Larchmont, N.Y., she is survived by her husband of 50 years, David Gelman; another son, Andrew, of Manhattan; a daughter, Amy Haugesag of Kansas City, Mo.; two grandchildren; a sister, Florence Roher of White Plains; and her mother, Shirley Rodkinson, also of White Plains.       
         Phyllis Wattis, a philanthropist and art collector who contributed more than $150 million to cultural institutions in California, and who was instrumental in financing a stellar collection for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in the 1990's, died on Wednesday in San Francisco, where she lived. She was 97.         Although the museum's new building was much praised when it opened in 1995, many in the art world said the collection was not up to so splendid a setting. Mrs. Wattis helped correct the imbalance by facilitating the purchase of a wide range of top-quality work by, among others, Magritte, Mondrian, Warhol and Eva Hesse, as well as by contemporary artists like Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg and Wayne Thiebaud .         She was also generous to performance groups, contributing toward a new hall for the San Francisco Symphony. With her help, the San Francisco Opera commissioned new works like ''Dead Man Walking'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and staged productions of operas like Berg's ''Lulu'' and Janacek's ''Katya Kabanova,'' which remain hard-to-sell items in the standard repertory.         ''I've had the same seats at the opera for 30 years,'' she said four years ago in an interview in The New York Times. ''I felt it was my duty to get them out of 'La Bohème.' ''         Mrs. Wattis, whom one museum director called ''California's Brooke Astor,'' came to the arts relatively late. Born Phyllis Cannon in 1905 in Salt Lake City, she was a great-granddaughter of the Mormon founder Brigham Young and the daughter of a prosperous sugar company executive. She studied economics in college and married Paul L. Wattis, who was the head of the construction company that built the Hoover Dam. They settled in San Francisco in 1936.         Although her husband loved opera, he considered visual artists to be little more than ''decorators,'' Mrs. Wattis said. It wasn't until the 1950's that she visited the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for the first time. Her own interest in modern art developed fully only after she visited the international art exhibition called Documenta, in Kassel, Germany, in 1964.         Mrs. Wattis and her husband established a foundation for cultural and scientific causes in 1958. After his death in 1971, she oversaw the foundation herself, but liquidated its assets in 1988, distributing the money to various institutions, among them the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the California Academy of Sciences. Although she made many large contributions to institutions, including $20 million to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, she was also known for giving personal gifts, as when she bought an English horn for a teenager in the San Francisco Youth Orchestra.         She is survived by a son, Paul Wattis, of Paicines, Calif.;, a daughter, Carol Casey, of San Francisco; five grandsons; three granddaughters; and eight great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Wattis was widely admired for her unpretentious character, her astute eye and her adventurous embrace of contemporary work. A year ago, she bought at auction a major 1963 painting by the California-based artist Ed Ruscha, and last November she helped the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquire ''Splitting: Four Corners'' (1974), by Gordon Matta-Clark, which consists of parts of a house that the artist had sawn vertically in half.       
         Holly Solomon, an art dealer known for her championship of the new and untried, for her spirited, high-stepping lifestyle and for being the subject of a glamorous portrait by Andy Warhol that made her a Pop icon like Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from pneumonia, her son Thomas said.         In its heyday, the Holly Solomon Gallery represented an eclectic mix of talents, from the video artist Nam June Paik to William Wegman, the painter and draftsman better known as a whimsical photographer of Weimaraners. The gallery was especially known for nurturing, in the 1970's, the mini-movement known as Pattern and Decoration, a reaction to the austerities of Minimalism.         ''P & D'' artists -- among them Kim MacConnel, Brad Davis, Robert Kushner, Ned Smyth, Valerie Jaudon and Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt -- used humble materials like plastic wrap and motifs from exotic cultures to produce ornate, wildly patterned paintings and assemblages.         In 1969, before becoming dealers, Ms. Solomon and her husband, Horace, opened 98 Greene Street Loft, one of the first so-called alternative spaces in New York, where poetry readings, dance performances, concerts and art shows took place. It lasted three years and gave very early exposure to talents like Laurie Anderson, Robert Mapplethorpe, Mr. Kushner and Gordon Matta-Clark.         A small, vivacious woman with silver-blond hair, Ms. Solomon was a forceful personality who regarded her artists as part of her family. (When she moved to a smaller apartment in 1988, a group of them designed, decorated and made furniture for it.) A fashionista and a voracious shopper, she was always dressed in her version of the latest, including the quirky costume jewelry that she collected.         With Mr. Solomon, her partner in the gallery until their separation in 1988, she gave lavish soirees at their East 57th Street apartment for hundreds of people involved -- or not -- in her world. Artists were always part of the crowd. ''Unlike others who invited artists to be the entertainment,'' Mr. Kushner said yesterday, ''the Solomons regarded us as guests, and they fed us very well.''         An early collector of Pop art, Ms. Solomon liked to refer to herself as a ''Pop princess.'' Her portrait was done by Mapplethorpe, Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Artschwager, Christo, Robert Rauschenberg and, of course, Warhol.         She was fond of relating how, for the Warhol portrait (a nine-panel work sold at auction by Christie's last year for $2 million), she took $25 in quarters into a photo booth and spent hours snapping herself doing facial exercises learned as a budding actress. Two years later Warhol produced the portrait.         The glamorous Solomon persona was tempered by a sense of fun. Mr. Kushner, who as a young artist searched for manufacturers' cast-off fabrics in SoHo, recalls that he was working in a local restaurant when Ms. Solomon, already a collector of his art, appeared in a floor-length white mink coat. Outside was her father-in-law's station wagon and a chauffeur. ''Let's go for a ride,'' she commanded, and soon they were having an uproarious time digging in trash bins around SoHo.         Ms. Solomon was born Hollis Dworken in Bridgeport, Conn., where her Russian-born father ran a grocery and liquor store. She attended Vassar College but switched to Sarah Lawrence, where her interests in acting, art and social life were more readily fulfilled. She soon met and married Mr. Solomon, a Yale graduate working for his wealthy father, a hairnet and bobby-pin manufacturer.         At first the two lived a proper, well-heeled Manhattan life. But Ms. Solomon, enrolled in Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio, began to make the rounds of Off Off Broadway theaters. With time on her hands, she took to dropping in at art galleries and museums. Her first acquisition, a ceramic lamp by Dan Flavin, was quickly followed by others, including a Brillo carton by Warhol that was put to use as a coffee table.         Soon the couple had an extensive collection of Pop art, and by 1967 they were well established on the scene. On the acting front, Ms. Solomon, under the name Hollis Belmont, appeared in a feature-length movie, ''The Plot Against Harry,'' made by an independent filmmaker in 1969 (but not released until 1989), in which she played a prostitute. In 1972 she wrote, directed and produced ''98.5,'' about five artists at the 98 Greene Street Loft; it won an award at the Edinburgh Film Festival that year. But her acting career was a failure, and she became more and more involved with art.         In 1975, three years after the 98 Greene Street Loft had closed, the Solomons opened their first commercial space, the Holly Solomon Gallery at 392 West Broadway in SoHo. It was devoted to Ms. Solomon's discoveries: young artists whose work looked beyond that of the Pop/Minimal establishment. By 1978, after several shaky years, the gallery was discovered by European dealers and collectors and became a hot SoHo destination.         But in 1983 the Solomons, alarmed at SoHo's expansion and faced with a steep rent increase, moved the gallery uptown to 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, where, though smaller, it retained its glittering presence. In the early 1990's the gallery moved back to SoHo, at 172 Mercer Street, where Ms. Solomon showed her regular artists like Mr. Paik and newer additions like Izhar Patkin. After real estate and legal difficulties, Ms. Solomon closed that gallery three years ago. Wanting to be in on the Chelsea action, in the last few years she operated out of an appointment-only gallery at the Chelsea Hotel.         Ms. Solomon's survivors include, besides her son Thomas, of Los Angeles, another son, John, also of Los Angeles, and a brother, Dr. Donald Dworken of Greenwich, Conn.         ''She was an original, as strong a personality as any of her artists,'' said Mr. Wegman, who was particularly close to the Solomon family. ''She loved art and people. Her death, like Warhol's, leaves a gap.''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.

And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, she was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Lorna J. Marshall, a college English instructor turned homemaker who in her 50's began a new life as an anthropologist studying the Bushmen of Africa, died on July 8 at her home in Peterborough, N.H. She was 103.         She had lived with her daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, since 1996, Ms. Thomas said. She previously lived in the same house in Cambridge, Mass., since the late 1920's.         Mrs. Marshall's anthropological career began when her husband, Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and president of the Raytheon Corporation, retired in 1950 with the thought that it was time to get reacquainted with his family.         ''Where is the remotest place we can go and be a family again?'' Mr. Marshall asked, said Irven DeVore, the More research professor of anthropology at Harvard.         The Kalahari Desert was the answer he found. He decided he would take his family to live among the legendary Bushmen.         ''They became a sort of Swiss Family Robinson of the Kalahari,'' Dr. DeVore said.         The family's accomplishments made it more than that. Mr. Marshall helped the Bushmen start a fine-wool industry. The Marshalls' son, John, began his career as a leading maker of ethnographic documentary films. Ms. Thomas, who would go on to write best sellers like ''The Hidden Life of Dogs,'' wrote a well-received book on the Bushmen, ''The Harmless People'' (Knopf, 1958).         Meanwhile, Mrs. Marshall began the painstaking process of documenting the culture and behavior of the Bushmen, sometimes called !Kung. (The ''!'' represents a clicking sound in their language). She was the first of dozens of scholars who have made the Bushmen one of the world's most studied populations of traditional hunter-gatherers.         ''To say she started it is not a mistake,'' Dr. DeVore said. ''By standards of ethnography, she did as well or better than any monograph I know, and she was there early.''         Over the next two decades, the Marshall family made eight trips to the Kalahari, a desert the size of Spain in what is now Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa, staying for as long as a year and a half at a time. Then the family would return to Cambridge, where Mrs. Marshall would employ the best graduate students to organize her voluminous notes, which resulted in two books and many articles.         An honor she particularly valued was having a !Kung baby girl named after her. The child was called Norna, because the Bushmen, for all their ability to make unusual vocal sounds, cannot pronounce the letter L.         Lorna Jean McLean was born in Morenci, a mining town in the Arizona Territory, on Sept. 14, 1898. Her father, Gordon McLean, a mining engineer, died when she was 7. Her mother, the former Bessie Holmes, remarried and moved with her daughter to Riverside, Calif., and then Los Angeles.         Miss McLean graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English. She then gave up the beginning of a career in ballet to travel around the world with her mother, who had been widowed again. They traveled throughout the Middle East and Asia. In China, they met an instructor at Mount Holyoke College who offered Miss McLean a job teaching English.         She accepted, but soon met Mr. Marshall in Nova Scotia, where both had relatives. They married and moved to Cambridge.         At the Cambridge Community Center, she organized women to salvage tungsten wire from radio tubes that Raytheon could re-use in making electronic devices. The salvage operation employed black and white women, unusual at the time, and permitted women to work flexible hours, which was also unusual.         Mr. Marshall said he wanted to do something with his family when he retired, and its members were interested in anthropology. So he asked his wife to take some courses at Harvard, which she did from time to time among trips to Africa.         The family was at first apprehensive about tales of poison darts and trance dances, but found the Bushmen polite and kind. The Marshall family lived in tents, even as temperatures ranged from freezing to 125 degrees.         Mrs. Marshall published her first book, ''!Kung of Nyae Nyae,'' in 1975 (Harvard University Press), and her second, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites,'' three years ago (Peabody Museum Press).         She is survived by her daughter, her son, who lives in Belmont, Mass., three grandchildren and three great-granddaughters.         She is remembered by others. A year or so after her 100th birthday party, the child of a Bushman she had known as a child came to visit her.       
         Maritta M. Wolff, a novelist who burst onto the literary scene in 1941 with what Sinclair Lewis called ''the most important novel of the year'' and proceeded to write a string of vibrantly raw best sellers, died on July 1 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 83.         The novel, ''Whistle Stop,'' Ms. Wolff's first, became a movie of the same name starring George Raft and Ava Gardner. She wrote five more novels, then, without public explanation, stopped writing.         She married Leonard Stegman, who was in the costume jewelry business. She collected trinkets and bric-a-brac. For the final four decades of her life, her writing consisted of letters, many to fans who never tired of discussing the nuances of her plots and characters, Laura Stegman, her daughter-in-law, said.         It was not the destination that seemed likely when Ms. Wolff, at 22, wrote an 830-page story for a composition class at the University of Michigan and began her journey to the summits of the literary world. In 1940, the story won her the Avery Hopwood Prize, awarded along with $1,000 for excellent writing by University of Michigan students.         In 1941, the work appeared as ''Whistle Stop,'' trimmed to 450 pages and bubbling with gritty, robust dialogue. It surged through five printings and a miniaturized armed forces edition that so captivated soldiers and sailors that many sent fan letters. They particularly yearned to know the nature of the relationship between the sibling characters Kenny and Mary.         ''We in Barracks No. 2 have examined the situation from all angles -- and I do mean all angles -- and we can reach no satisfactory solution,'' a soldier wrote in 1945.         The answer was that what seemed to be incest was exactly that, but subtly portrayed. It was typical of Ms. Wolff's work: she pulled no punches, yet exhibited the gifted storyteller's delicate, essentially indescribable grasp of human nature.         Edith H. Walton wrote in her review of ''Whistle Stop'' in The New York Times Book Review: ''Because this is a very unusual book, and a strongly individual one, I am conscious that I have not really succeeded in conveying its flavor. That flavor is acrid, tangy, humorous, robust -- yet beneath all the humor there is a bitter and genuine emotion.''         Ms. Wolff's feel for the rhythms of speech -- developed in coffee shops and bars -- had much to do with the impact. A sample passage from her first novel:         ''Well, I gotta get dressed up all beautiful. Who knows, tonight, I might meet a great big beautiful man with a job and an automobile and he might take just one look at me and say, 'Baby, I'm nuts about you,' and I might just take one good look at him and say . . .''         Orville Prescott, in a 1942 review in The New York Times of ''Night Shift,'' Ms. Wolff's second book, called her feel for the American language phenomenal.         ''One feels certain that this is a scientifically exact record of the speech of factory workers in an automobile bumper plant, of taxi drivers, waitresses in cheap restaurants, beautiful dumb women and beautiful smart ones who haunt small-time night clubs,'' Mr. Prescott wrote.         Maritta Martin Wolff was born on Dec. 25, 1918, on a farm near Grass Lake, Mich., and grew up watching people, including those at the one-room country school she attended.         ''My one hobby was developing, as far back as I can remember, an inordinate interest in people and anything and everything happening to them,'' she wrote.         As soon as she learned penmanship, she began to write. Or, as she later put it, take dictation.         ''My characters have a habit of getting their own ideas,'' she told The Akron Beacon Journal in 1944. ''They tell me mine are goofy. They run away and do as they please.''         As did she. She refused to publicize her books, becoming more adamant as her career progressed and publishers demanded more of authors. Family lore says that was why she stopped writing.         At the University of Michigan, she met Hubert Skidmore, whom she married. Mr. Skidmore had written six novels by the time he was 30, including ''Hawk's Nest,'' about an industrial accident in West Virginia.         He died in a house fire in 1946. The next year, Ms. Wolff married Mr. Stegman, who survives her, as does their son, Hugh, of Los Angeles.         The reaction to ''Whistle Stop'' could hardly have been more enthusiastic, not least because of her searing language and hotter plots. A review by Clifton Fadiman in The New Yorker said, ''If she can write this way at 22, she should be good for a banning in Boston before she's 25.''         She wrote more books: ''About Lyddy Thomas'' (1947), ''Back of Town'' (1952), ''The Big Nickelodeon'' (1956) and ''Buttonwood'' (1962).         Then Ms. Wolff disappeared. Her writing seemed limited to correspondence and detailed records of repairs and oil changes for the silver Jaguar she loved to drive.         Her refrigerator has contained a complete, unpublished novel for years, her family said.       
         Edith Merrill Bancroft, a patron of the arts and the widow of Harding F. Bancroft, a vice chairman of The New York Times Company, died last Monday at her home in Washington. She was 90.         Edith Hall was born in Atlanta on April 17, 1912. She was the daughter of William Claiborne Hall, an executive of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and the former Christine Collins. She grew up in Cincinnati and Louisville.         She graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and married Frederick T. Merrill, a Foreign Service officer in 1935. She volunteered as a nurse's aide at a Washington hospital during World War II. Mr. Merrill died in 1974.         In 1987, she married Mr. Bancroft, a former diplomat and lawyer who, as vice chairman of The Times Company, helped shape the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971. He retired in 1975 and died in 1992.         She is survived by her son, Frederick T. Merrill Jr. of Washington; her daughters, Linda Merrill Ciccone of Florence, Italy, and Dr. Marianna Merrill Russell of Sparks, Md.; her sister, Noel Train of Washington; 11 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.       
         Lillian Goldman, who made a major contribution to the reconstruction of the library at Yale Law School, in part because it was among the first law schools in America to admit women, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 80.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, the family said.         In 1992, Mrs. Goldman gave Yale University Law School what Guido Calabresi, then its dean, called ''probably the biggest gift in the history of American legal education'' -- more than $20 million, principally for the reconstruction and expansion of its library, which was renamed the Lillian Goldman Law Library.         Mrs. Goldman's gift was also used to endow a day care center at the law school, as well as for scholarships for underprivileged students, particularly women and those interested in the study of women's rights.         Mrs. Goldman's choice of Yale Law School reflected her friendship with Dean Calabresi, her interest in women's education and the school's early readiness to admit women and minority students when most other universities refused to accept them.         The first woman to graduate in law from Yale, Alice Jordan of Michigan, received her diploma in 1886 after the law faculty had defied the university's scandalized trustees by accepting her. It was not until 1918, however, that a formal policy of admitting women was established. Harvard Law School, by comparison, did not accept women until after World War II.         Lillian Schuman Goldman was born Jan. 17, 1922, in New York City. At 19, she married Sol Goldman, who had bought his first building at 17 and whom she urged to leave his family grocery business in Brooklyn and plunge full time into the world of New York real estate.         Mrs. Goldman played an active role in the real estate activities of her husband, who by his death in 1987 was one of the largest private landlords in New York City. But she also wrote poetry and was deeply committed to education. ''A book is a friend,'' she used to say.         After her husband's death, she turned her attention increasingly to philanthropy, creating the Lillian Goldman Charitable Trust to administer her gifts.         A meeting with Rita Hayworth, the film actress, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, led to a gift of about $1 million last year to the Alzheimer's Association, for medical research. After her son, Allan, developed Parkinson's disease, she became a supporter of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.         Both organizations presented her with awards in the last year in recognition of her help.         In 1998, she made a $5 million gift to the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan for the family center there, and a few weeks before her death, she gave $1 million for renovation of the Kane Street Synagogue in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.         In addition to her son, Allan, of New York City, Mrs. Goldman is survived by her daughters, Amy Goldman of Rhinebeck, N.Y., and Jane Goldman and Diane Kemper of New York City.       
         Helen Matthew Robinson, the matriarch of the family that in 1864 bought the Hawaiian island of Niihau and then so zealously guarded its privacy that it is the only one of the islands where Hawaiian is still spoken as an everyday language, died on July 31 at her home in Makaweli, on the island of Kauai. She was 91.         Though Mrs. Robinson herded cattle at 65, climbed trees at 75 and drove until she was 85, her health had gradually deteriorated in recent years, her son Keith said. She finally had to relinquish decision making concerning the island, which she had assumed in 1969 with the death of her husband, Lester.         Keith Robinson said his mother's influence lived on in the indigenous people who still speak Hawaiian and in the population of rare monk seals on the coastline. Both are results of so severely restricting access to Niihau that it is known as ''the forbidden isle.''         Niihau (pronounced nee-ee-HOW), the seventh-largest Hawaiian island, is 69.5 square miles and is 17 miles southwest of Kauai. Geologically the oldest of the Hawaiian islands, it is considered the home of the volcano goddess Pele, according to legend. Niihau was the only Hawaiian island to vote against statehood in 1959.         The 200 or so residents collect delicate shells to make leis that sell for thousands of dollars. The islanders also work on the Robinsons' sheep and cattle ranch in return for salaries, free housing, food and education for their children. Their daily life seems a throwback to the misty Hawaiian past. There is no electricity or indoor plumbing -- rain is collected in buckets. There are no paved roads, and conversations are conducted in the lilting native language, though Mr. Robinson said that more English words were creeping in.         Guns and alcohol are forbidden, and the Robinsons will not bring tobacco on the weekly supply barge. The residents can be evicted at any time and have no contractual rights.         Mrs. Robinson herself tended to minimize the uniqueness of Niihau, even as she fought to preserve it.         ''It's just a little cattle ranch we operate in our own way,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1970. ''There's nothing sensational about it. I don't see why everyone is so interested in it.''         The story of the Robinsons and the island begins in Edinburgh with Eliza Hutchinson, the widow of a Scottish sea captain, Francis Sinclair. With some of her children and their spouses, Mrs. Sinclair eventually went to the Sandwich Islands, as Hawaii was then known.         There she met the ruler of Hawaii, King Kamehameha IV, who offered her several parcels of land, including one that stretched from what became downtown Honolulu to Diamond Head in Waikiki. She turned it down in order to buy an entire island, paying $10,000 in gold in 1864.         As he signed the contract, the king said: ''Niihau is yours. But the day may come when Hawaiians are not as strong in Hawaii as they are now. When that day comes, please do what you can to help them.''         The family, who were strict Calvinists, required all residents of the island to attend Congregational church services on Sunday. (It was an easy sell: missionaries had converted them to Christianity 40 years before.) At first, visitors were permitted, though scarce water supplies began to limit invitations.         From the beginning, Mrs. Sinclair and her heirs sought to protect the indigenous culture. They also remained close to the royal family and opposed the American overthrow in 1893, after which the provisional government forbade use of the Hawaiian language.         Keith Robinson said the family totally cut off visits to Niihau in the 1930's because of the vulnerability of people to diseases to which they had never been exposed like measles, which had killed 11 children on the island.         Lester Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's husband, was the great-grandson of Eliza Hutchinson. He grew up in the family compound in the Makaweli District of Kauai, where Mrs. Sinclair had bought more property.         Helen Marion Matthew was born on Aug. 2, 1910, in Washington, D.C., which her family was visiting. She grew up in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of California.         Her aunt, a tutor to Lester Robinson when he was a boy, arranged a visit to the Robinsons in 1935, and a reluctant Lester was asked in advance to look after Helen. Rather than the dreaded child in pigtails he expected to meet, she turned out to be an attractive, friendly woman in her mid-20's. Keith Robinson said he had always heard it was love at first sight, though the two were not married until 1937.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Robinson rejected numerous offers for the island, including a large one from Japanese interests. The only intrusions she permitted were tourist helicopter flights overhead and secret military activities, which were kept away from both endangered wildlife and residents.         Keith Robinson said he and his brother, Bruce, had no intention of changing anything on the island, much less selling it. Mrs. Robinson is also survived by seven grandchildren.         In 1983, she wrote a letter to a researcher in which she chose one word to describe her vision of Niihau: ''seclusivity.'' It is not in the dictionary, but her meaning was apparent.       
         Daphne Bayne Hellman, the jazz harpist who performed around the world and for three decades at the Village Gate but who had a special affection for playing on subway platforms, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Manhattan. She was 86.         Ms. Hellman, who had played on the streets of Paris at a music fair as recently as June, was recuperating from injuries suffered in a fall last month near her town house on East 61st Street, her family said.         In a wildly peripatetic musical career that began in the 1940's at Town Hall -- where Time magazine called her ''as curvesome as a treble clef'' -- her professional choices were generally as eccentric as those she made in the rest of her life.         She saw nothing particularly unusual, she said, about plucking her harp on the street in front of the Hotel Pierre, where she came out to society in 1933, at a supper dance in the roof garden.         She did not seem to care what people thought when, after years of playing well-to-do places for well-to-do crowds, she also took the stage at clubs like CBGB, on the Bowery, accompanied by the kitchen-drawer percussion of a man called Mr. Spoons, otherwise known as Joseph Jones Jr., whom Ms. Hellman put up in her town house after his third wife left him.         She played the Beatles or Roger Miller or bluegrass warhorses like ''Foggy Mountain Breakdown'' with as much appreciation as she played Bach and Debussy, Gershwin and Kern.         Although she was an heiress with substantial means -- ''My mother had mucho money,'' she said in one interview -- she liked to count the money she earned when she began playing in the subway in the 1980's, sometimes carrying coins to a delicatessen near her house to trade them for bills.         ''She was just the antisnob, that's what she was,'' said Art D'Lugoff, who owned the Village Gate, where Ms. Hellman and her trio, Hellman's Angels, played every Tuesday for 30 years when she was in town. It was one of the longest nightclub runs in the city's history.         ''She had money and she knew a lot of people and she got along with everybody,'' said Mr. D'Lugoff, whose club closed in 1994. ''She opened up a new world for me, and I opened up a world for her.''         Ms. Hellman was sometimes compared to Katharine Hepburn, not only because of her high cheekbones and patrician good looks, but also because she lived a life of elegant rebellion, even before she first touched a harp at the age of 12.         Born Daphne Van Beuren Bayne, the granddaughter of the founder of the Seaboard National Bank, she recalled in a 1990 profile in The New Yorker that as a child she liked to keep bats and armadillos as pets. ''They are much maligned and misunderstood,'' she said of bats.         As a young woman, she first tried acting, training in New York and London and landing a walk-on part in a Broadway production of ''Hamlet.'' She also modeled for Man Ray and Harper's Bazaar. But after her marriage to her first husband, Harry Bull, the editor of Town & Country magazine, and the birth of their son, Sandy, she began to take the harp more seriously.         Over the strong objections of her father, she had her jazz debut at a cabaret called Le Ruban Bleu, at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue. Over the next few years, she played at a string of clubs that sound like a roll call from another musical era: the Hotel New Yorker, with Ving Merlin and his All-Girl Band; Upstairs at the Downstairs, with Blossom Dearie and Imogene Coca; Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe; the Versailles; Le Perroquet.         Once, at Le Ruban Bleu, according to the New Yorker profile, a young Billie Holiday, quite drunk, angrily refused to share the club's only dressing room with Ms. Hellman, who played there twice a year.         But most of Ms. Hellman's relationships with famous people were much more congenial and enduring. Her cluttered East Side town house, usually full of boarders, birds, dogs and litters of gerbils, served as the base for a kind of floating salon. And she was its musical Zelig, whose close friends included, besides Mr. Spoons, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the artist Saul Steinberg and the writer Norman Mailer.         In the 1940's, she had briefly supplied a beautiful face and high-society name to gossip columns when her marriage to Mr. Bull fell apart and she had an affair with Geoffrey T. Hellman, a writer for The New Yorker. She married him in Reno in 1941, hours after her divorce from Mr. Bull. (Her son, Sandy Bull, a noted guitarist, died last year; she is survived by a daughter, Daisy Paradis, and a son, Digger St. John.)         Mr. Hellman left her for another woman, and in 1961, she married Hsio-Wen Shih, a Chinese-American architect and writer, who left their home one day in 1965 and disappeared, breaking her heart, friends said.         ''It was like he went out for a pack of cigarettes and just didn't come back,'' said Lyn Christie, the bassist in Ms. Hellman's trio, who played with her for decades, everywhere from the subway to Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Bombay and Hong Kong.         ''It felt sort of like the trips we made to China were an attempt to try to find out about him,'' Mr. Christie said. ''But we never did come across him.''         Ms. Hellman's daughter, Daisy Paradis, said that her mother, who sometimes smoked a pack of Salems a day, had slowed down only slightly over the last few years. She had not played the subway for quite a while, mostly because it had become harder to find someone to help her lug her 85-pound harp down to the platform. But she played in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka this year and was appearing at the Firebird Cafe in Midtown at the time of her fall.         ''She was an incredibly intrepid woman,'' said Mr. Christie, who recalled that in Hong Kong she tried to ride on horseback into Communist China. ''She loved to do whatever she knew you weren't supposed to do.''       
         Eleanor Searle Whitney McCollum, a singer and a philanthropist in the fields of medicine, music and religion, died Aug. 12 at her home in Houston. She was 93.         An Ohio doctor's daughter, Mrs. McCollum was a concert and opera singer for a short time after graduating from Florida Southern College. In 1941 she married the industrialist and sportsman Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Her divorce from Mr. Whitney in 1958 resulted in a settlement estimated at more than $3 million.         In a 1971 interview, Mrs. McCollum explained her almost full-time involvement in religious and charitable causes by saying, ''Those to whom much is given, much is expected.''         She was married to a Houston oilman and banker, Leonard F. McCollum, from 1975 until he died in 1993.         In Houston, Mrs. McCollum's charitable activities included fund-raising for Orbis International, an organization that promotes eye health around the world.         Other recipients of her support included Baylor College of Medicine, Hopi Indian students and young operatic artists.         A native of Plymouth, Ohio, she studied music at Columbia. Over the years, she performed as a singer for the Billy Graham Ministries and with the United States Air Force Band, and she spoke and sang at religious gatherings.         Her survivors include a son, Cornelius Searle Whitney of Berkeley, Calif., and a grandson.       
         Lucia Pamela, a one-of-a-kind entertainer best known for recording a music album in 1969 about her fictional travels to the moon, died on July 25 in a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 98.         Until 1992, Ms. Pamela's only album, ''Into Outer Space With Lucia Pamela,'' was all but forgotten. Irwin Chusid, a radio disc jockey, helped revive her career and produced a reissue of her album. When a small independent label, Arf Arf, reissued it on CD that year, record collectors around the world took note. Not only were the homemade lyrics and songs unusual and full of infectious childlike optimism and sincerity (she truly believed she had gone to the moon), but her background was equally compelling.         Ms. Pamela's story is a mixture of fact and self-invention. She claimed, for example, to be the first person ever on television and radio; that Ignace Paderewski told her mother she would be the finest pianist in the world; that she was kicked out of a German music conservatory for being overqualified. Relatives said there were grains of truth in all these stories.         Ms. Pamela was born in St. Louis, and her mother was a concert pianist and composer. In 1926, Ms. Pamela won the title of Miss St. Louis. After performing in St. Louis theaters, she moved to Fresno, Calif., where she managed the Fresno Storyland amusement park (she also played Mother Goose there). She was also the host of two radio shows for young women, ''The Encouragement Hour'' and ''Gal About Town.''         Ms. Pamela formed what some say was the country's first all-female orchestra, Lucia Pamela and the Musical Pirates, in which she claimed to have played 15 instruments. With her daughter, Georgia, she formed the vocal duo the Pamela Sisters. Nowadays her daughter, Georgia Frontiere, is best known as the owner of the St. Louis Rams. Ms. Pamela married several times, the last time to Billy Angelo, a professional prizefighter, who died in 1987.         Ms. Pamela is also survived by a son, Ken Irwin of Palm Springs, Calif.; 12 grandchildren; and 27 great-grandchildren.         A documentary on her life is being completed by Danielle Lemaire, a Belgian artist.         One of Ms. Pamela's proudest accomplishments, she liked to say, was building a rocket, touring the Milky Way and stopping on the moon to record her album. With the feel of a warped bebop children's album, it features Ms. Pamela on all instruments -- piano, accordion, drums, clarinet, and probably various household appliances -- accompanying herself as she tells, with gee-whiz glee, tales of amiable lunar roosters, trips to Mars and blue winds. At 65, she sang of a world where anything was possible and everything was shot through with an innocent joy, excitement and imagination.         The album was released in 1969 on a small label, Gulfstream, and signed copies are said to fetch as much as $1,000. She also created a coloring book that tells the story of a moon trip in which she met cows, Indians and anthropomorphic cashews. ''Some of the people there spoke Almond,'' she wrote.         A tireless entertainer, Ms. Pamela was cited by ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for having memorized some 10,000 songs. The English band Stereolab even wrote a song about her, ''International Colouring Contest.'' She performed at Las Vegas hotels into her 80's.         ''It was recorded on Moontown,'' Ms. Pamela said of her album. ''I was the only one from Earth there.''       
         Jackie Raven, a performer and promoter of tap dancing, died on Aug. 19 at her home in Setauket on Long Island. She was 51.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, the trombonist Ray Anderson.         Ms. Raven began dancing fairly late in life as a student in Japanese studies at Barnard College. On a trip to Japan she had what she called a cosmic vision of becoming a tap dancer.         Back in New York, she studied with Jane Goldberg and Cookie Cook. ''Tap is like a disease in a way,'' she said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times. ''It gets you. And then that's it.''         Ms. Raven, who had a master's degree in linguistics from the State University of New York at Brockport, was a primary force in the tap dance revivals of the 1970's and 80's in New York.         She promoted Albert Gibson of the Three Chocateers and performed in his Gibson Girls chorus line. She also promoted George Hillman, who performed in the Broadway musical ''Black and Blue,'' and Ralph Brown, who had been a headline dancer with the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band.         Ms. Raven was a charter member of Brenda Bufalino's American Tap Dance Orchestra. In 1981 Ms. Raven founded the N.Y.C. Tapworks trio with Neil Applebaum, a dance-trained wrestler with a master's degree in child development. The trio was completed by Clara Hetherington, a hospital neuropsychophysiology technician.         The three performed a varied repertory of traditional tap steps, Latin and jump-rope numbers, as well as dances choreographed by Bill Irwin, Leon Collins and Ms. Bufalino.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Raven is survived by a son, Raven Anderson, and a daughter, Anabel Anderson, both of Setauket, and a sister, Deborah Libaire of Bellport, N.Y.       
         Kim Hunter, whose eclectic 60-year career included an Oscar, two Emmy nominations and a Broadway triumph with her portrayal of Stella in the legendary 1947 debut of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died on Wednesday at her New York apartment. She was 79.         A founding member of the Actors Studio whose screen career was temporarily derailed by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950's, Ms. Hunter was recently hospitalized for a fall and had been in declining health. She died of a heart attack in her apartment above the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.         Ms. Hunter caught the acting bug in elementary school and was never a snob about the roles she chose, mixing highly demanding parts with smaller ones in B-movies, long stints in regional theater, television guest appearance and even a running role on an ABC soap opera, ''The Edge of Night,'' in 1979 and 1980.         But without doubt the roles for which she is most remembered are Stella Kowalski, Marlon Brando's passionate and beleaguered wife in the stage and film versions of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' and Dr. Zira, the coquettish simian with a fondness for Charlton Heston in the 1968 film ''Planet of the Apes.''         The role of Stella also won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress when the director Elia Kazan adapted his Broadway production to the screen. The scenes of an anguished Stanley Kowalski (Mr. Brando), disheveled and grimy, screaming up to his wife -- ''Stella!'' -- in the backyard of their seedy New Orleans home, and of Ms. Hunter's sexually charged descent on a winding staircase into his arms, have become iconic cinematic moments.         Feisty, occasionally profane, Ms. Hunter frequently told interviewers that she had no use for the trappings of Hollywood stardom that had always eluded her.         ''The work itself has been my life,'' she said in 1999. ''I was never in this for jazzy stardom, and as far as that's concerned, I've never had it. Doesn't matter to me.''         Ms. Hunter was born in Detroit, and her father died four years later. Her mother and stepfather moved the family to Miami Beach when she was 10, and there she developed a taste for the theater.         ''I was lonely growing up,'' she said. ''My only brother was nine years older and had little time for me. So I picked friends out of books and played let's-pretend games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''         Before long she had an acting coach and made her stage debut at 17 in the title role of ''Penny Wise'' at the Miami Women's Club. Later she took roles with stock companies around the country. At the Pasadena Playhouse in California, in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract with the producer David O. Selznick.         For her 1943 screen debut, Selznick loaned her to the horror-film producer Val Lewton, for whom she played a young woman battling devil worshipers in ''The Seventh Victim.''         Shortly afterward, Ms. Hunter took a supporting role in the Ginger Rogers film ''Tender Comrade,'' about young women living communally during World War II, a film that struck some as pro-Soviet. It was cited, years later, as a reason that her name appeared in ''Red Channels,'' a 1950's pamphlet naming suspected Communist sympathizers.         Ms. Hunter, a liberal Democrat, had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, though she never belonged to the Communist Party. She said she traced her problems with the blacklist to a world peace symposium that she helped sponsor in 1949. No one ever announced that she was on a blacklist, she said.         ''Gradually it became sort of clear,'' she said. ''I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then, finally, it was NBC. And then by that time, I won my Oscar for the movie of 'Streetcar,' but I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.''         Her hiatus from the screen lasted until 1956, when she appeared opposite Bette Davis in ''Storm Center,'' about book-burning. ''I thought, uh-oh, here we go again,'' she said. But her political problems did not reignite.         Ms. Hunter was one of the few forgiving voices when many in Hollywood rebelled against awarding Mr. Kazan a special Oscar in 1999. He had never apologized for naming names to Congressional investigators during the blacklist days.         ''The whole business is dumb,'' she told one interviewer. ''Artistic achievement and the mistake someone made years ago don't belong together.''         The ''Streetcar'' role came about because Selznick's wife Irene remembered the actress when it came time to cast the role of Stella. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, but rehearsals were held on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater.         ''Tennessee sat way in the back and when he had a thought about something, he'd write a note and come down to where we were working, reach over and tuck the note into Kazan's coat pocket,'' Ms. Hunter said.         Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the entire cast. ''All act not only with color and style, but with insight,'' he wrote.         Ms. Hunter's 1944 marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. The couple had one child, Kathryn, now of Stamford, Conn., who took the name of Ms. Hunter's second husband, Robert Emmett. Emmett, also an actor, died in 2000. The couple had a son, Sean Robert, also of Stamford, and Ms. Hunter is survived by six grandchildren.         As for her other most celebrated role, Ms. Hunter said ''Planet of the Apes'' was a project she respected. ''I thought it was a damned interesting script and a challenge for all of us,'' she said.         She spent hours at the Bronx Zoo, she said, studying primate behavior. But the project turned out to be more of a challenge than she had anticipated, largely because of the cumbersome makeup. ''The only part of me uncovered was my eyeballs,'' she said. ''I had to breathe through my upper lip. It was wild.''         Ms. Hunter also appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1952 drama ''Deadline USA,'' and drew critical praise in ''Lilith'' (1964) and ''The Swimmer'' (1968), among other roles. More recently, she had a small role in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         ''Acting is my life,'' she said in 1994. ''It doesn't get easier. It gets harder. I find it more challenging as I do it and realize how much more has to go into it. But I thank God I am in a profession where there is no retirement age.''       
         LaWanda Page, the acid-tongued comedienne who, as the cantankerous Aunt Esther, traded barbs with Redd Foxx on the 1970's sitcom ''Sanford and Son,'' died on Saturday in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was complications of diabetes, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Page was a veteran of the black circuit of theaters and nightclubs. She began as a dancer, added a fire-swallowing bit (billed as the ''Bronze Goddess of Fire'') and moved gradually into skit and stand-up comedy on the so-called Midwestern ''chitlin circuit.'' Most of those clubs, she later said, were dumps, the kind of places ''where if you ain't home by 9 o'clock you can be declared legally dead.''         Her big break came when she was tapped for a supporting role in the second season of Norman Lear's ''Sanford and Son,'' which starred Foxx, a friend from comedy club days, as Fred Sanford, an eccentric and irascible junk dealer in the Watts section of Los Angeles. As the ungainly, wisecracking, Bible-toting sister of Sanford's late wife, Elizabeth, she quickly became one of the show's most popular characters.         Her character, Aunt Esther, took her share of zingers from Foxx and other cast members -- Sanford's friend Grady once quipped, ''Nice having her around, she makes the junk look so pretty.'' But Aunt Esther usually responded with equally stinging rejoinders. ''Watch it, sucker!'' her favorite catch phrase, was followed by a spate of sharp-tongued invective. The exchanges between her and Sanford were among the weekly highlights. ''Sanford and Son,'' ran from 1972 to 1977 on NBC and remained one of television's top rated shows, inspiring several spinoffs in which she also appeared.         Ms. Page was born in Cleveland on Oct. 19, 1920, and began her dancing career at age 15. After years on the club circuit with comedians like Foxx and Richard Pryor, Ms. Page moved to Los Angeles in the 1960's and joined the comedy group Skillet, Leroy & Co. She soon developed and honed her trademark feisty comic approach -- more shrill but still reminiscent of Moms Mabley's homespun wit. (''Honey, that old man couldn't keep no kinda job. That's the only man I know that ever went to the unemployment office and lost his place in line.'')         She is survived by a daughter, Clara Johnson, of Los Angeles.         Throughout the 1970's and 80's, Ms. Page played cameo roles in a few feature films and made guest appearances on talk shows and sitcoms. Offstage, she was an advocate for equal opportunities and better pay for black performers.       
         Florence Lessing, a favorite dancer of the influential jazz-dance choreographer Jack Cole and a featured dancer on the Broadway stage and in nightclubs and films, died on Sept. 5 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was kidney failure, said her son, Eric Canepa.         Ms. Lessing began to work with Cole, who died in 1974, soon after he spotted her as a teenager in an East Indian dance class. The two of them, along with the teacher, Anna Austin, formed a professional trio that performed at the Rainbow Room in 1938.         The next year the three went to Hollywood to perform Cole's choreography in the musical ''Moon Over Miami,'' which starred Betty Grable. Because of her exotic appearance, Ms. Lessing often performed femme fatale roles. The variety of dance forms she had studied helped make her an instrument for the development of Cole's eclectic style.         Ms. Lessing also worked with leading modern-dance choreographers of the time on the concert stage and in stage and film musicals. In 1943 Doris Humphrey created ''El Salón México'' for Ms. Lessing and José Limón to the Aaron Copland score. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, singled out Ms. Lessing in 1943 for her performance in the Humphrey work and for her nightclub dancing with Charles Weidman and Peter Hamilton at the Versailles nightclub.         Ms. Lessing was featured in many Broadway shows, among them ''Windy City,'' choreographed by Katherine Dunham; ''Sailor Beware,'' choreographed by Cole and starring Mary Martin; and ''Kismet,'' also choreographed by Cole. She danced in the 1952 film musical ''Just for You,'' choreographed by Helen Tamiris and starring Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman. Ms. Lessing also choreographed two of her own nightclub acts in the mid-1940's.         She taught dance at several schools, including the New York Academy of Ballet, which she founded in 1960 and which closed in 1991. In the 1970's she was important in reconstructing Cole's choreography for the American Dance Machine.         In addition to her son, of Manhattan, Ms. Lessing is survived by her husband, Tito Enrique Canepa, also of Manhattan, and a daughter, Dr. Cathy Canepa of White Plains.       
         Eileen Jackson Southern, a scholar of Renaissance and African-American music and the first black woman to be appointed a tenured full professor at Harvard University, died on Sunday at her home in Port Charlotte, Fla. She was 82.         As a researcher, author and teacher, Dr. Southern documented the history and scope of African-American contributions to American music. Much of her work remains in print.         ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'' (1971) is in its third edition (Norton, 1997). She also compiled the ''Biographical Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians'' (Greenwood, 1982) and ''The Music of Black Americans'' (Norton, third edition, 1997).         In 1973, with her husband, Prof. Joseph Southern, she founded Black Perspectives in Music, the first musicological journal on the study of black music. She edited the journal until it ceased publication in 1990.         She received a National Humanities Medal in 2001 for having ''helped transform the study and understanding of American music.'' She also received the 2000 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society of American Music.         In a way, Eileen Southern's mission was prompted by a question she encountered while teaching at CUNY's York College in 1968. At issue was the inclusion of music in a black-studies curriculum. She recalled that a colleague asked, ''Besides jazz, what is there?''         Her life's work was meant to give an answer.         She traced the evolution of black choruses from church singing groups, and a startling number of black orchestras like the Negro Philharmonic Society of New Orleans. In the early 1900's, black and white audiences flocked to Carnegie Hall to hear the Clef Club Symphony Orchestra under its conductor James Reese Europe play music by black composers like Harry T. Burleigh and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.         Eileen Jackson was born in Minneapolis and grew up in Chicago. Encouraged by her parents, whose home was a haven for black musicians, she studied piano and made her first concert appearance at age 7. She continued to give concerts on tour while pursuing her academic career and musicological studies until the mid-1950's.         She graduated in 1940 from the University of Chicago, where she received a master's degree the next year. Her thesis was ''The Use of Negro Folksong in Symphonic Form.'' Faced with racial discrimination, she started teaching at traditionally black colleges in Texas and Louisiana.         Moving to New York in 1954, she taught public school before joining the CUNY faculty of Brooklyn College in 1960. She became a full professor in 1972 at York College, where she also served as chairwoman of the music department.         In the 1950's she studied at New York University under the Renaissance music scholar Gustave Reese. She received her Ph.D. in 1961 with a dissertation about Renaissance music. It was published as ''The Buxheim Organ Book'' (Institute of Mediaeval Music, 1963).         Dr. Southern went to Harvard as a lecturer in 1974 and received a dual appointment in Afro-American studies and music in 1976. She headed the department of Afro-American studies from 1975 to 1979 and retired in 1987 as a professor emeritus.         She is survived by her husband of 60 years, Professor Southern; a daughter, April S. Reilly of Florence, Calif.; a son, Edward J., of Port Charlotte; a sister, Stella Hall of Chicago; and three grandchildren.         She was the editor of ''African American Theater: 'Out of Bondage' (1876), and 'Peculiar Sam: or The Underground Railroad' (1879)'' (Garland, 1994). She also wrote, with Dr. Josephine Wright, ''Images: Iconography of Music and Musicians in African-American Culture'' (Garland, 1998). Both are in print.         Dr. Southern remembered her reception at Harvard as far from cordial. In ''A Pioneer,'' an essay she contributed to the 1993 anthology ''Blacks at Harvard,'' she told of years of stress spent gaining respect for herself and the fledgling department she headed.         But she invoked her role model, W. E. B. Du Bois. ''Like him, I went to Harvard because it was a great opportunity for me as a black female scholar, and I accepted the reality of racial and sex discrimination,'' she wrote. ''In its role as nurturer of scholars, Harvard never let me down!''       
         Alina Pienkowska, a shy and soft-spoken nurse whose impassioned words turned a shipyard strike in Gdansk, Poland, in 1980 into a nationwide and triumphant movement called Solidarity that ultimately helped to bring down Communism, died on Oct. 17 in Gdansk. She was 50. The cause was cancer, friends said.         Ms. Pienkowska spent much of her life in and around the giant shipyard on the Baltic shore. Her father worked there and had joined in protests in 1970 that led to army shootings in which dozens of workers were killed. A decade later, the young woman, widowed and with a young child, was working as a nurse at the yard.         By then she had become involved with a very small circle of activists who distributed a clandestine journal called The Coastal Worker, organized by Bogdan Borusiewicz, a passionate proponent of independent labor unions who was later to become Ms. Pienkowska's husband. Mr. Borusiewicz is currently a candidate for mayor of Gdansk.         In August 1980, Ms. Pienkowska was a withdrawn, single mother with prematurely gray hair who contributed articles to The Coastal Worker on health-related subjects like the rising rate of industrial accidents. That month, Anna Walentynowicz, a decorated crane operator at the shipyard and another member of Mr. Borusiewicz's circle, was fired. On Aug. 14, leaflets protesting her dismissal were distributed, and a dismissed welder named Lech Walesa, also in the group, climbed into the shipyard and proclaimed a strike.         From the windows of her apartment, Ms. Pienkowska saw that a strike had begun. Rightly assuming that state security agencies would have cut phone lines from the yard in the hope of keeping the strike secret from the nation and the world, she called friends in Warsaw, who alerted Western reporters, making sure the news would spread through Poland over Radio Free Europe.         But her greater contribution came two days later when she was with her fellow strikers in the shipyard. By then, many smaller factories and government establishments in the region had been struck, with their workers composing lists of demands. On Aug. 16, the shipyard management offered strikers there a considerable raise. The strike committee agreed, and Mr. Walesa announced that the strike had ended. Thousands of jubilant workers headed for the gates and home.         Ms. Pienkowska was enraged, realizing that as a result of the agreement tens of thousands of strikers at plants throughout the region were being left in the lurch. She found the voice and courage to attack Mr. Walesa.         ''You betrayed them,'' she said of the strikers beyond the shipyard walls. ''Now the authorities will crush us like bedbugs.''         She managed to shut one gate and pleaded for the strikers to stay and maintain the strike. Some lingered, but most rushed home to their families. But Ms. Pienkowska's message got through, and in many cases wives sent their husbands back; by nightfall the shipyard was filling up once more.         The strike had been salvaged in the spirit of solidarity, a word that would soon provide the free trade union movement with its name.         Among those who praised Ms. Pienkowska after her death was Andrzej Wajda, who said that she had been the model for a character in his film ''Man of Iron,'' which was based on events in the shipyard.         He said the actress who played the role spoke Ms. Pienkowska's words: ''Here in the shipyard I stopped being afraid, stopped running away, and became a real person.''         Immediately after her intervention, she was elected to a new strike committee that was able to negotiate the historic agreement guaranteeing workers the right to form unions independent of the government or the ruling Communist Party.         For the next decade she worked for Solidarity, both when it was legal and when it was outlawed in 1981. At the outset of the martial law period, she was detained and held for more than a year.         In 1983 she married Mr. Borusiewicz, who was in hiding, in a secret ceremony. A year later her husband, still a fugitive, attended the baptism of their son while disguised as an old woman. Mr. Walesa, a guest, unsuspectingly kissed his hand.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Kinga; and her son, Sebastian.       
         Mary Maxine Reed, who in 1971 won a landmark Supreme Court case that struck down dozens of state laws discriminating against women, died on Sept. 26 near Boise, Idaho.         She was believed to be about 93, though she would not tell her age, her lawyer Allen Derr said.         On Nov. 22, 1971, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an Idaho law that automatically gave Mrs. Reed's former husband preference over her as administrator of their dead son's estate violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.         The Supreme Court called the Idaho law ''the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause.''         It was the first time the Supreme Court had declared a state law unconstitutional because it discriminated against one sex.         The ruling overturned many similar laws around the country, including another Idaho law declaring the husband the head of the family, with the right to determine where it lives, as well as a 1948 Michigan law prohibiting women from serving alcoholic drinks in bars. Previous challenges to such laws before the Supreme Court had failed.         The case came about in 1967 after the Reeds' 16-year-old son, Richard Lynn Reed, shot himself. Mrs. Reed and her former husband, Cecil, from whom she was divorced in 1958, applied to a court to administer their son's small estate, which consisted chiefly of a clarinet, phonograph records, clothes and $495 in a savings account.         Mrs. Reed lost the first court battle because Idaho law said that when two people were equally qualified to be administrators, preference must be given to a man.         Saying she was angry that ''women could be stepped on like that,'' Mrs. Reed then appealed to the District Court and won.         But the Idaho Supreme Court reversed that decision on appeal. Mrs. Reed took her case to the Supreme Court.         Mary Maxine Reed, known as Sally, was probably born in Nebraska around 1909. Orphaned early, she was adopted by George and Nettie Kelso, who moved to Cambridge, Idaho, where they farmed. She graduated from Cambridge High School in 1929 under the name Mary Kelso.         In 1931 she married Cecil R. Reed in Ontario, Ore. They eventually moved to Boise, where her husband worked for the Idaho Highways Department. They adopted Richard Lynn, their only child.         After their divorce, Mrs. Reed earned her living by ironing, baking, baby-sitting and looking after disabled people in her Boise home. She retired in 1998.         In a widely reported legal battle that contrasted with the rest of her quiet life, Mrs. Reed was assisted by Mr. Derr, her Boise lawyer, and two lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, Mel Wulf and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is now a Supreme Court Justice.         In a letter to Mr. Derr read at Mrs. Reed's funeral on Oct. 5, Justice Ginsburg said, ''Sally Reed lived to see the good that came from her brave decision to challenge an unjust law.''       
         Phyllis Calvert, a ladylike actress who packed British movie theaters in the darkest days of World War II with her performances in wildly melodramatic, escapist costume dramas, died on Tuesday in London. She was 87.         Along with Margaret Lockwood, Stewart Granger and James Mason, the redheaded Miss Calvert was one of the cornerstones of Gainsborough Pictures, a subsidiary of the J. Arthur Rank film empire. In the 1940's Gainsborough churned out swashbuckling films that were hissed by critics but highly popular with a war-weary public yearning for fantasy.         She first achieved fame as one of the so-called Gainsborough Girls in ''The Man in Gray'' (1943), a Regency drama in which she played the virtuous Clarissa, trapped in a loveless marriage to the sadistic Marquis of Rohan (Mason) and eventually saved by an actor (Granger).         In ''Fanny by Gaslight,'' the next year, Miss Calvert fell prey once again to the treacherous and seductive Mason, only to have her virtue saved by Granger.         Two other hits followed. As Maddalena in ''Madonna of the Seven Moons'' (1944), Miss Calvert played the schizophrenic wife of an Italian wine merchant who periodically flees to Florence, where as Roseanna, she becomes the mistress of a brigand, not surprisingly played by Granger.         Then in ''2000 Women'' (1944) she led the inmates of a women's prison camp in Nazi-occupied France in a spirited rendition of ''There'll Always Be an England'' as the crew of a shot-down British bomber escaped.         Phyllis Bickle, who later changed her named to Phyllis Calvert, was born in London on Feb. 18, 1915. She went to the Margaret Morris School of Dancing and the Institut Français and made her first stage appearance at 10 in 1925. She made her film debut at 12.         After working in repertory theater in various British cities, she first appeared in the West End in 1939 in ''Punch Without Judy.'' During that production she met her future husband, the actor and publisher Peter Murray Hill, who died in 1957.         Her first big stage success came in 1942 in Terence Rattigan's ''Flare Path,'' a wartime drama about a bomber base that Winston Churchill called his favorite play. When not acting she spent the evenings as an air raid warden.         After the war Miss Calvert went to Hollywood, where she appeared in Universal's ''Time Out of Mind'' and several other pictures. But unlike other British actresses of the time, like Vivien Leigh and Deborah Kerr, she did not repeat her British success with American audiences.         Other notable London theater appearances were in Graham Greene's ''Complaisant Lover'' in 1959, Oscar Wilde's ''Woman of No Importance'' in 1967 and Noël Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' in 1970.         Although Miss Calvert tended to be typecast in drawing-room comedies and minor thrillers, she tackled several weightier roles, touring with the Oxford Playhouse Company as Madame Ranevskaya in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1973 and playing the Countess in Anouilh's ''Rehearsal'' in 1961.         She is survived by a son, Piers, and a daughter, Auriol.       
         Patricia Hochschild Labalme, an executive and a trustee of foundations that give major support to education and scholarly research as well as a scholar of the Renaissance, died on Friday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 75 and also lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Dr. Labalme was a trustee and the head of the humanities program of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, which supports academic research, particularly on Venetian history.         She was formerly associate director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Most recently, she was a visitor in historical studies at the institute, finishing a book about the Venetian diarist Marino Sanudo.         She was a trustee and past executive director of the Renaissance Society of America, a former trustee of the American Academy in Rome and a former president and life trustee of the Brearley School board.         Patricia Hochschild was born in Manhattan and graduated from Bryn Mawr College. She received a master's and a doctorate from Harvard.         She also taught and lectured at colleges including Wellesley, Barnard, Hunter and New York University.         Dr. Labalme is survived by her husband, George Labalme Jr.; three daughters, Jennifer R. Labalme of Indianapolis, Lisa G. Osterland of Montreal and Victoria A. Labalme of Manhattan; a son, Henry G., of Manhattan and West Cornwall; a sister, Ann H. Poole of Princeton; and six grandchildren.       
         Harriet Doerr, who at 73 published her first novel, unveiling an exquisite gift to marshal clear, sparse prose to evoke, in her phrase, memories ''like a gentle knife stuck into your heart,'' died on Sunday at her home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 92.         She had been in declining health since she suffered a broken hip in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha Doerr Toppin. In recent years, glaucoma and frailty kept her from writing, even at her methodical pace of a sentence or so an hour.         Ms. Doerr's gleaming literary reputation rested on three slender books, perhaps 600 pages in all.         Her first book, ''Stones for Ibarra'' (Viking, 1984), which won the American Book Award for first fiction, was called ''a perfect book'' by the writer Alice Adams, and her next novel and a book of short stories elicited similar praise.         Her style roamed the geography of Mexico, memory and mood in a manner that the critic Anatole Broyard in The New York Times said carried ''echoes of Gabriel García Márquez, Katherine Anne Porter and even Graham Greene.'' Her gift for phrasing was suggested by her description of the Mexican village as ''no more than a shard chipped from the rock face of eternity.'' Elsewhere she called it ''a town of a hundred burros.''         Her critics generally agreed that she improved with age, and emphasized that her works would have been remarkable for a writer of any age.         In reviewing her second novel, ''Consider This, Señora'' (Harcourt, 1993), published in 1993, when she was 83, the critic Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, ''Everything is richer, as when an actress takes a role you saw her play a decade ago, and lets you read that decade in her face, her voice and her body.''         Harriet Green Huntington was born in Pasadena on April 8, 1910, the third of six children and two step-children. Her grandfather was Henry Edwards Huntington, and she played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. She grew up with nannies and servants, as well as more intangible blessings: her family loved reading and lively discussions, her daughter said.         Ms. Doerr was asked to read several of her poems at high school graduation, but would not allow the school to reproduce them because she thought they were awful. When she was 16, she met Albert Doerr, an engineering student at Stanford University who took her to a prize fight on their first date. She was horrified, not least because of the droplets of blood that had spattered on her dress.         She went east to Smith College in 1927 with her train compartment filled with roses from Mr. Doerr. She did not like the cold of Massachusetts and felt homesick and ''half in love.'' By the summer of 1928, she left Smith and transferred to Stanford. where Mr. Doerr was finishing his degree. They married in 1930, and she left college.         They had two children; the first, a son, Michael, died of cancer in 1995. Ms. Toppin, the second child and Ms. Doerr's only survivor, lives in Oakland.         In World War II, while her husband served in the Navy, she and he signed petitions protesting the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps.         The family went to Mexico in the late 1950's. There Mr. Doerr oversaw the revival of his family's mining business. Much of the emotional quality of that experience is contained in Ms. Doerr's first novel, including the male protagonist's struggle with leukemia. Mr. Doerr died of leukemia in 1972.         Her son teased Ms. Doerr into returning to college in 1975. She first took some classes at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., and then enrolled full time at Stanford, majoring in history. She was accepted into the university's prestigious creative-writing program. Other students resented her presence, until she read her first piece aloud.         Ms. Doerr won the $2,500 Transatlantic Review-Henfield Foundation Award in 1982, based on three stories she had published in small literary magazines. Senior editors at Viking Penguin suggested her stories could be combined into a novel. She and a professor shuffled them on her living room floor until a larger narrative fell into place.         Her next novel, ''Consider This, Señora,'' was also set in Mexico and was seen by some critics as imitative. But Laura Cumming, writing in The Guardian of London, said it was ''full of enchanted fables.''         ''The Tiger in the Grass'' (Viking, 1995) was a collection of essays, many about Mexico. But words of searing pain reflected a more immediate concern: her son was then dying of cancer, and Ms. Doerr used italicized passages to tell his story. In one, she remembered that his first word was ''car'' and that the doctor had just forbidden him to drive.         ''Now his car is parked outside his house and is visible from several windows,'' she wrote. ''I have forgotten the details of Chinese water torture we used to hear of, but it must be something like this.''         Ms. Doerr believed in no religion, but often took solace in each person's ability to create memories that live on. In ''Consider This, Señora,'' the character Ursula Bowles, a widow who enters the story at age 79 and exits at 83, witnesses life's evanescence.         ''She could see that an individual life is, in the end, nothing more than a stirring of air, a shifting of light,'' Ms. Doerr wrote. ''No one of us, finally, can be more than that. Even Einstein. Even Brahms.         ''Then the widow slept.''       
         Vinnette Carroll, the trailblazing actress, director and playwright who was the first African-American woman to direct a production on Broadway, died Tuesday at her home in Fort Lauderhill, Fla. She was 80.         The cause was complications from diabetes and heart disease, said Anita MacShane, a friend.         A black woman in a business often dominated by white men, Ms. Carroll's career included several theatrical milestones and a consistent sense of activity and ambition.         As a director, she was not only the first black woman to direct on Broadway -- the musical revue ''Don't Bother Me I Can't Cope,'' in 1972 -- but she also brought her best-known show, the gospel-infused ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' to Broadway on three separate occasions. As an actress, Ms. Carroll won an Emmy (''Beyond the Blues,'' in 1964), an Obie (''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl,'' in 1962) and was nominated for three Tony awards.         Ms. Carroll was also the founder and artistic director of the Urban Arts Corps, a New York-based training and producing organization devoted to supporting black and Hispanic theater and actors. The group fostered the careers of hundreds of performers, including Cicely Tyson and Sherman Hemsley, as well as presenting ''Don't Bother Me'' and ''Your Arms Too Short.'' The onetime director of the New York State Ghetto Arts Program, which brought theater and dance to poor neighborhoods, Ms. Carroll also worked in Los Angeles at the Inner City Repertory in the Watts district, presenting classical and modern works.         Born into a well-off Jamaican family, Ms. Carroll moved to Harlem when she was 10 and found an instant affinity for the arts, playing viola with the Dean Dixon Symphony when in high school. Her father, however, who was a dentist, had medical plans for her. After graduating from Long Island University, Ms. Carroll received a master's degree in psychology from New York University and worked briefly as a clinical psychologist in the New York City schools.         At the same time, though, she was moonlighting in acting classes; drama soon won her over. In 1948, she was accepted to the Erwin Pescator dramatic workshop at the New School, where she studied with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.         A tall woman with with round cheeks and a high brow, Ms. Carroll was not classified as beautiful in the traditional sense, but still she impressed her teachers with her expressive eyes and resonant voice.         After honing her craft by acting at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., Ms. Carroll found some work in the theater in the 1950's, and also toured extensively with a one-woman show that she wrote. Her Broadway debut came in a short-lived revival of ''A Small War on Murray Hill,'' open for a single week in January 1957.         It was during the 1960's and 70's, the height the national black theater movement, that Ms. Carroll's talents came into full bloom.         In 1962, she won her Obie in ''Moon Over a Rainbow Shawl'' Off Broadway, stealing scenes from her castmate James Earl Jones. A year later, ''Trumpets of the Lord,'' Ms. Carroll's musical adaptation of seven sermons, became a runaway Off Broadway hit. In 1964, she won her Emmy. In 1966, she garnered more praise for directing and starring in the Langston Hughes play ''Prodigal Son,'' a production that toured Europe.         In 1967, she founded the Urban Arts Corps, which produced dozens of shows out of a space on West 20th Street. In 1969, another production of ''Trumpets of the Lord'' opened on Broadway, but closed in less than a week.         Ms. Carroll more than made up for the brevity of that run with two enormous success during the 1970's. The first was ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' a roof-raising gospel revue with songs by Micki Grant, which Ms. Carroll conceived, produced and directed at the Urban Arts Corps in 1970 and later took to Broadway, where it ran for 1,065 performances. Ms. Carroll's direction was nominated for a Tony, making her the first black woman ever to win that nomination. (She lost to Bob Fosse for ''Pippin.'')         Shortly after ''I Can't Cope'' closed, in 1974, Ms. Carroll began conceiving a followup, a gospel celebration of the Gospel of St. Matthew. That show, ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' with music and lyrics by Alex Bradford and Micki Grant, turned out to be a big success, spawning several national tours and two return trips to Broadway, including a 1982 version starred Patti LaBelle and Al Green. A fourth trip to Broadway is being planned for next year.         Not all of Ms. Carroll's efforts were as successful. A pricey adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' titled ''But Never Jam Today,'' had a tortured route to Broadway, only to close within a week, in 1979.         Ms. Carroll divided her time between New York and Florida, where she bought a house in the 1980's. She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Carroll Hudgins, of Manhattan.         In the late 1980's, she founded a theater in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., devoted to featuring work by minority playwrights and actors. Throughout her life, Ms. Carroll was an eloquent speaker about the challenges of being black and female.         ''I have had a great deal of hurt in the theater both as a Negro and as a woman, but I don't get immobilized by it,'' she said an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1967. ''I tell myself that no one individual is going to make it impossible for me.''       
         Beatrice Renfield, a philanthropist who had been a longtime member of the board of directors of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, died on Wednesday at a medical center in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Renfield, whose family had owned a wine- and spirits-importing company, donated $1 million earlier this year to endow the Beatrice Renfield Nursing Research Program in the Center for Home Care Policy and Research of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. She was also a benefactor of the Yale School of Nursing and Beth Israel Medical Center, of which she was a trustee. The medical center's Beatrice Renfield Center for Nurses opened in September.         She was a native of Newark and attended New York University.         Her husband, Harold L. Renfield, who predeceased her, had assumed her surname when they wed. She is survived by a son, Robert L.; a daughter, Anna Jo Dubow; nine grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; a brother, Joseph; and a sister, Jean Miller.       
         Florence Segal Lowe, a retired public relations executive and journalist who managed communications for the National Endowment for the Arts from 1970 to 1986, died on Thursday in Washington. She was 93 and lived in the Georgetown section of Washington.         She and her husband, Herman Lowe, who died in 1961, were Washington correspondents for Variety, TV Guide and other publications.         Born in New York City, she grew up in Pennsylvania and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania.         Her survivors include a daughter, Lesley Lowe Israel of Royal Oak, Md.; a son, Roger Bernard Lowe of Arlington, Va.; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and a brother, Irving R. Segal of Philadelphia.       
         Ellen Straus, a passionate environmentalist and co-owner of the first organic dairy farm west of the Mississippi River, died on Saturday at her home in Marshall, Calif., north of San Francisco. She was 75.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         A pioneer in the purchase of development rights from farmers to save the land from being turned into tract housing and shopping malls, Ms. Straus was a founder of the Marin Agricultural Land Trust in 1980. But she is probably best known outside the Bay Area for the rich, thick milk produced on the family farm, which her son Albert turned into high-quality cheese, yogurt and butter at the Straus Family Creamery.         Ellen Tirza Lotte Prins was born on Feb. 21, 1927, in Amsterdam. Her family fled the country just ahead of the Nazi invasion in 1940. She graduated from Bard College in New York in 1948, but instead of fulfilling her dream of studying medicine, she married William Straus, a German Jewish immigrant 12 years her senior, who had come to study agriculture at the University of California.         It took him only 16 days to persuade her to abandon further studies and move to what was then a small farm on the shores of Tomales Bay in Marin County, Calif. There they brought up four children, Albert, Vivien, Miriam and Michael, who survive her, along with her husband, four grandsons and a sister, Anneke Prins Simons of Jersey City.         Inspired by Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring,'' Ms. Straus turned her attention to the environmental movement when she learned of plans to build hundreds of homes along the Marin County coast as well as a resort at Tomales Bay. She was instrumental in the creation of the Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, preserving 17 ranches. Along with other environmentalists, she persuaded the county supervisors to pass strict zoning laws.         But just to make certain the restrictions could not be changed she helped found the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, or MALT, which now has 47 ranches and dairies covering 32,000 acres. It represents 30 percent of the private farmland in Marin County, and the owners have granted easements saying it must remain agricultural land. Ms. Straus served on its board until 1990 and was its chairwoman from 1999 to 2001.         Today there are 1,000 land trusts throughout the country, and the trust was the model for scores of them.         The Straus family used the money it received for its own conservation easement to convert its farm into an organic operation, a move that saved it from the unprofitable co-op milk market and made it possible for the Strauses to stay in business by selling more profitable products.         Those products, unhomogenized milk with a thick layer of cream on the top, bottled in glass; cream that almost whips itself; and Monterey Jack and white cheddar, are sold throughout California. The farm's Holstein cows also produce all the milk used by the acclaimed Cow Girl Creamery of Point Reyes, for crème fraîche, fromage blanc and Mount Tam triple cream cheese.         Ms. Straus was a hands-on farmer. On the first night of the farm's organic operation, she individually stamped the expiration dates on glass milk bottles as they rolled off the conveyor. Three or four times a year, she led educational tours of the dairy for the agricultural land trust, preparing the lunch for the 50 or so people who attended.         In 1998, the American Farmland Trust in Washington, D.C., presented Ms. Straus with the annual Steward of the Land Award in recognition of her lifelong struggle for family farms. The White House made her a Points of Light winner in 2001 for her lifetime of volunteer work.         When she was honored by the American Farmland Trust, Ms. Straus said World War II had taught her a lifelong lesson about standing for one's beliefs: ''That we, as individuals, are responsible for what is happening in our communities, and that we must become activists.''       
         CAROL ENSEKI, president of the Brooklyn Children's Museum, is an island of tranquillity in the sunny bedlam of a little building that echoes with the din of ecstatic children. She chooses words precisely. She utters them with preternatural calm. Her gentle delivery is so deadpan that it takes a visitor a moment to realize that she has made a sly joke.         She will need every shred of that equanimity and every ounce of that wit to persevere in the coming seasons of uproar in her 103-year-old museum. A $39 million expansion will double the museum's interior space to 102,000 square feet when it is completed in 2006.         The museum, in Crown Heights, will get two new classrooms, a new library, a new exhibition gallery and a cafeteria. The 25-year-old subsurface building will be transformed into a daffodil-yellow two-story showcase, designed by the architect Raphael Viñoly, and featuring two L-shaped wings spreading along Brooklyn and St. Marks Avenues.         Fitted with funky portholes that will glow at night, the museum will have the appearance of a clowny yellow submarine that has rambunctiously surfaced in a neighborhood of brownstones and Victorian houses.         Pretty phat for an institution that the Association of Children's Museums in Washington recognizes as the nation's oldest children's museum.         The existing building was below ground for maximum energy efficiency and to merge it seamlessly with the adjacent Brower Park. But years ago, when crime and vandalism became a problem in Crown Heights, Ms. Enseki's predecessors put up fences. Residents complained that the museum seemed too inward-looking.         Now crime in the neighborhood has dropped significantly, and the museum's relationship with its neighborhood is certainly the opposite of the bunker mentality.         ''The new building will be outward-looking,'' Ms. Enseki said. ''In this community, we are more than just a museum.''         Ms. Enseki's style ''may seem very low-key, but she is passionate about working to get visibility for her museum,'' said Martin Gomez, who came to know her in the seven years he was director of the Brooklyn Public Library. He left the library earlier this year.         Ms. Enseki, 48, attributes her peaceful presence to her Japanese-American heritage. Ms. Enseki's mother, Emi, and her mother's parents were in an internment camp during World War II. Her family lived in New York for a time after their release, which was arranged by Quakers.         ''I have to believe that her calm personality is traceable in part to that,'' said Mr. Gomez, now director of the Friends and Foundation of the San Francisco Public Library.         Ms. Enseki arrived at the museum in 1989 as a developer of exhibits and became its president in 1997. Actually, she is a second-generation exhibit designer: her father, Richard, created industrial exhibits for trade shows, building them in his garage in Glen Rock, N.J., where the family had moved.         ''I think I was destined for the museum field,'' Ms. Enseki said, recalling that her father built ''this eyeball in the garage, for some drug company.''         NOW, Ms. Enseki's family is an unofficial sounding board for her museum's endeavors. Her husband, Bill Fulbrecht, is an artist and kindergarten teacher at Public School 321 in Park Slope. And their son, Daniel, 10, is not shy about critiquing new exhibits.         The museum appeals to children, from toddlers to 15-year-olds. It draws about 250,000 visitors a year, including 30,000 in groups from schools and summer camps.         Mr. Gomez said the museum, which employs 60 people full time, is an anchor of the neighborhood. When community leaders opened it in 1899, the visitors were immigrant children, largely from Eastern Europe. Now 60 percent are African-American or Caribbean-American, and about 25 percent are Jewish.         The museum has raised all but $7 million of the reconstruction cost, which will include $25.2 million from New York City. The money for the expansion is already in the capital budget and, despite the city's financial crisis, ''we are optimistic and confident that construction will move forward,'' Ms. Enseki said.         Many children's museums are in high-traffic tourist areas, but, Ms. Enseki said, ''we are firmly planted in a residential neighborhood, and it has shaped who we are.'' As a member of the board of the American Association of Museums, she has championed the idea that urban museums serve more sophisticated audiences and must be prepared to address questions about issues like AIDS and racial unrest.         After three days of strife in the neighborhood in 1991, the museum ''dealt with the issue directly'' in exhibits, she said.         ''Then, as now, we hope that people will come to the museum so that it can help dispel stereotypes and fears,'' she said. ''You know, a lot of good things happen around here that don't get a lot of notice.''         Ms. Enseki's immediate goal is to keep the museum open during the construction. ''But the real challenge for us is the same it has always been,'' she said. ''To make sure that people know about us.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Margaret Taylor Hancock, whose many-hued family tree sprang to life in a book by her daughter that became a meditation on the meaning of race in America, died on Tuesday in Branford, Conn. She was 90 and lived in North Haven.         Mrs. Hancock was the product of a multiracial, multi-ethnic family and grew up black. Her siblings, from whom she was separated at age 4, grew up white. In 1994, Simon & Schuster published ''The Sweeter the Juice: A Family Memoir in Black and White,'' a portrait of life in the black bourgeoisie drawn by her daughter, Shirlee Taylor Haizlip.         Mrs. Hancock, born Margaret Morris in Washington and trained as a teacher, married a black minister and became a dedicated ''voluntary Negro.'' Her siblings went through life in white society, and it was not until 76 years later, in 1992, that she was reunited with a sister.         Her daughter, Mrs. Haizlip, used all means, from private eyes to public records, to trace their many strands of ancestry and relate their stories. There was, for instance, the great-grandmother who voyaged from Ireland to escape the potato famine and married a half-black slave.         He had learned to play the piccolo from his Scottish father, and, having fled from Virginia, played it in a Union Army band during the Civil War. There were African, American Indian, English and possibly Italian forebears, all with stories to tell.         In the 1900 census, Margaret Morris's family was classified as mulatto; it split only later into white and black branches. Young Margaret attended Miner's Teachers' College in Washington and, in 1933, married the Rev. Julian A. Taylor, son of a prominent Washington clergyman.         She was a co-founder of the N.A.A.C.P. branch in Ansonia, Conn., where her husband was a Baptist minister, and became active in the state's foster care system. She personally fostered six girls and found places for many others.         Mr. Taylor died in 1981. In 1987 she married Graham Hancock of New Haven, who died in 1993. She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Haizlip of Los Angeles; Dr. Jewelle Taylor Gibbs of Palo Alto, Calif.; and Patricia Taylor Brown of North Haven; 12 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.         When she reunited with her older sister, Grace Morris Cramer of Anaheim, Calif., after 76 years, they had ''six good years together,'' commuting coast to coast, Mrs. Haizlip said yesterday. Mrs. Cramer died in 1998.       
         Anna Hamburger, a longtime director of International Rescue Committee operations in Europe that aided refugees from Soviet bloc nations, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         She helped thousands of people who had fled Eastern Europe begin new lives in America.         Born Anna Walling in Cedarhurst, N.Y., she attended Swarthmore. She married Norman Matson in 1934. He died in 1966.         She is survived by her husband, the New Yorker writer Philip Hamburger, whom she married in 1968; a son, Peter Matson; 10 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Fay Gillis Wells, a pioneer aviator, a White House correspondent and a writer who covered Hollywood accompanied by her pet leopard, Snooks, died on Dec. 2 in Fairfax, Va. She was 94.         She had last lived in Alexandria, Va., her son, Linton Wells II, said, but her life had many takeoffs and landings -- and a famous bailout.         When she was a foreign correspondent, her mysterious movements during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia caused London tabloids to speculate that she was an Italian spy. Mrs. Wells and her second husband were sent by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on a top secret mission to Africa to look for possible postwar homelands for Jews. She married for the first time on a lark to experience the Palace of Weddings in Moscow, only to discover that the immediate divorce she and her husband had planned was a bit trickier.         Beginning with the sunny afternoon in 1929 when the biplane her instructor was piloting spun out of control over Long Island, Mrs. Wells, a slender, brown-haired woman, loomed large in the public eye. Her parachute jump to safety was reported in all the New York newspapers, resulting in her becoming among the first saleswomen of airplanes. She always said she fell into her first job, part of which was convincing women that aviation was safe.         By saving her life with a parachute, she became a member of the Caterpillar Club, so named because the silk in parachutes came from caterpillars. She was not the first woman to win that dubious distinction, as was widely reported; Irene McFarland had parachuted to safety in Cincinnati in 1925.         Four days after earning her federal pilot's license -- No. 9497 -- on Oct. 5, 1929, Mrs. Wells wrote letters to the 117 other American women who were licensed to fly, asking them to meet on Long Island. In part because of enthusiasm about Amelia Earhart's flight across the Atlantic the year before, 26 showed up.         Earhart, the first president, proposed calling the group the Ninety-Nines, in honor of the 99 charter members. Mrs. Wells, who was one of the last four of the 99, devoted much of the latter part of her life to maintaining the group's International Forest of Friendship in Earhart's hometown, Atchison, Kan.         Helen Fay Gillis was born on Oct. 15, 1908, in Minneapolis, and her family moved often. When her father, a mining engineer, went to Moscow in 1930, she was an aviation correspondent. She became the first American woman to fly a Soviet airplane and the first foreigner to own a Soviet glider.         When Wiley Post made a solo flight around the world in 1933, she arranged logistics and interpreted in Siberia. He invited her to fly with him for a 2,250-mile leg, but then decided against it because it might endanger the record as a solo flight.         Post tried to make it up to her by taking her on a flight in 1935 to Siberia by way of Alaska. She regretfully turned down the trip, which turned out to be the one on which Post and Will Rogers, her replacement, died in a crash near Point Barrow, Alaska.         Instead, she went on a honeymoon to Ethiopia with Linton Wells, a swashbuckling foreign correspondent. Their marriage grew out of a movie date in Manhattan. Instead of seeing ''The Wedding Night,'' starring Gary Cooper, they eloped and saw the movie the next night. Her brief first marriage was to Ellery Walter, a writer.         She reported feeling safer meeting the bearded warriors of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia alone at night than many of the men who hung around Broadway. She and her husband had bylines on Page 1 of The Herald Tribune on the same day. During lulls in the action, she taught other foreign correspondents to knit.         In 1936, the couple went to Hollywood, where Mrs. Wells reported for The Herald Tribune. They had taken a leopard, a lioness and a cheetah home, and she took the leopard along on interviews. In 1938, the two did radio shows from South America.         In 1941, they were asked by President Roosevelt to investigate possible African locations for a Jewish homeland, and they recommended Angola. After Linton II was born in 1946, they returned to the United States, and Mrs. Wells was a stay-at-home mother for 18 years. For four of those years, the family lived on a houseboat in Florida and Mrs. Wells designed nautical furniture.         In 1963, Mr. Wells took over the Washington bureau of the Storer Broadcasting Company, and Mrs. Wells was assigned to report on the White House. She was one of three women who traveled as reporters with President Richard M. Nixon on his trip to China in 1972.         Mr. Wells died in 1977. In addition to her son, who lives in Springfield, Va., Mrs. Wells is survived by her brother, Kenneth Gillis of Franklin, Mich., and two grandsons.         For years, Mrs. Wells went to Gettysburg, Pa., every week to play bridge with President Dwight D. Eisenhower's widow, Mamie. When she was 88, she oversaw a contest for fifth graders to design and fly paper airplanes. She deeply regretted missing out on being an astronaut.       
         Florence Stephenson Mahoney, an unwavering advocate for national health research and programs, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Washington. She was 103.         Working with the philanthropist Mary Woodard Lasker, Mrs. Mahoney was instrumental in the growth of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services through which the federal government finances medical research.         Starting as the one-room Laboratory of Hygiene on Staten Island in 1887, the agency, now comprising 27 institutes and centers for specific topics, is housed on a 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Md. Its budget for 2002 is $23.4 billion.         After World War II, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker lobbied to enlarge the agency, then a single institute. ''It is hard to realize today that government-subsidized research in the 1940's, when Florence Mahoney started her efforts, actually was controversial,'' said Judith Robinson, author of ''Noble Conspirator: Florence S. Mahoney and the Rise of the National Institutes of Health'' (The Francis Press, 2001).         With charm and persistence, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker pressed powerful politicians to support research on health issues.         ''When I wanted to get things done, I started at the top,'' Mrs. Mahoney told Ms. Robinson.         And the top often meant the president, whether it was Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson or Jimmy Carter.         Jack Valenti, a friend of Mrs. Mahoney, was a special assistant to the president in the Johnson administration.         ''When I would tell him that Mary Lasker and Florence Mahoney wanted to see him, the president would groan,'' Mr. Valenti said. ''He'd say, 'Oh, my God, these two women are going to bankrupt this country.' And they usually got what they wanted out of him.''         Eventually, the women focused on specific areas, with Mrs. Mahoney taking a special interest in aging and mental health.         In the 1960's Mrs. Mahoney began urging lawmakers to create an Institute on Aging at the N.I.H. She said the institute should concentrate on improving the quality of the lives of older Americans, not just their longevity.         In 1972, Mrs. Mahoney persuaded Senator Thomas F. Eagleton and Representative Paul G. Rogers to sponsor a bill creating such an institute. It passed, but President Richard M. Nixon would not sign it.         The next year, the bill was reintroduced, and Mr. Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal, again would not sign the measure. But Mrs. Mahoney kept up her efforts.         In the spring of 1974, the bill was passed a third time, and on May 31, 1974, Mr. Nixon signed it, just months before he resigned under the threat of impeachment.         ''There would not be an Institute on Aging without Florence Mahoney,'' Mr. Eagleton said. ''She was the creator and instigator of it. I was simply her messenger.''         Florence Amelia Sheets was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., on April 20, 1899, the eldest of three daughters born to Abraham L. and Julia T. Stephenson Sheets. She later adopted her mother's maiden name as part of hers.         Ms. Robinson wrote that Mrs. Mahoney remembered feeling a sense of social responsibility for the first time at age 10 when she was riding in a friend's pony cart.         ''There was an orphans' home nearby, which we passed once,'' Ms. Robinson quoted Mrs. Mahoney as saying. ''We didn't know what it was, so one time we thought we'd stop and find out. We went in, and I'll never forget it; I can still see it. Everything was gray. Even the children were all gray. It was all so depressing. That was my first feeling of social conscience.''         After graduating from Muncie High School in 1917, she enrolled in the Battle Creek Normal School of Physical Education in Michigan, where she studied anatomy and kinesiology. She taught physical education in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and studied dance in New York with an Italian ballet master whose students included Fred Astaire. She also took medical courses.         On Oct. 13, 1926, she married Daniel J. Mahoney, a Cox newspaper executive who became publisher of The Miami Daily News. They had two sons and divorced in 1950.         Mrs. Mahoney moved to Washington, turning her Georgetown house into a sort of salon, where politicians and scientists discussed issues over dinner.         Dr. Robert N. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, said that the dining room table was on the small side and that he believed it was by design, to encourage robust discussion.         Mrs. Mahoney's house had another claim to fame. Mr. Valenti, now the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said ''The Exorcist'' was filmed there.         Mrs. Mahoney is survived by a son, J. Michael Mahoney of Larkspur, Calif., and grandchildren.
