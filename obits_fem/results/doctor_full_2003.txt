         Amy Bess Williams Miller, who helped found Hancock Shaker Village, a restoration of a former Shaker community and a museum, died on Sunday at her home in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 90.         Mrs. Miller, an expert on the Shaker religious movement, was president of Hancock Shaker Village Inc. from 1959 to 1990. The museum and historic site on the border between Pittsfield and Hancock contains many pieces of Shaker handiwork, including Shaker furniture that Mrs. Miller donated.         She also raised funds and directed the restoration of the site, which had been a Shaker community for a century. The Shaker movement, named for the pious trembling of its members, began in 1747 in Britain as a celibate offshoot of the Quakers.         She began her work shortly before the Shakers ended the settlement in 1960, a century after Shakerism had begun to decline, leaving behind more than 12 buildings. At one time, it appeared that a nearby racetrack would acquire the buildings. But a group of Pittsfielders bought them from the remaining Shakers.         Mrs. Miller's writings include ''Shaker Medicinal Herbs: A Compendium of History, Lore, and Uses'' (1998, Storey in association with Hancock Shaker Village).         A doctor's daughter, Amy Bess Williams was born in El Paso and grew up in Worcester, Mass. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield and studied at the Sorbonne.         Her husband, Lawrence K. Miller, who was editor and publisher of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, died in 1991, after 58 years of marriage,         Her survivors include a daughter, Margo Miller of Boston; three sons, Kelton II, of Shaftsbury, Vt., and Michael and Mark, both of Pittsfield; a sister, Margery Adams of Charlotte, N.C.; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Burr McDermott, who as Anne Burr was a leading lady on Broadway and radio and in early television in the 1940's and 50's, died on Feb. 1 not far from her home in Old Lyme, Conn. She was 84.         After acting in stock and radio roles, she made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the drama ''Native Son,'' staged by Orson Welles.         Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times praised what he called her ''grim acting of the rich man's daughter'' as ''an accurate and fearless sketch of character without loss of time or motion.''         Other plays she acted in included ''Plan M'' (1942) and ''The Hasty Heart'' (1945). She signed a long-term contract at R.K.O. Radio Pictures and performed in radio dramas. In the early 1950's she was the leading lady, playing a doctor, in the CBS television series ''City Hospital.''         She was also one of the original stars of ''As the World Turns.''         After being blacklisted during the McCarthy era, she returned to an active television career.         In 1959 she ended her professional career and moved to Los Angeles with her husband, Tom McDermott, whom she had married in 1953.         Her husband died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Maggie McDermott-Walsh of Bernardsville, N.J.; two sons, Burr, of Boston, and Michael, of Beijing; and five grandchildren.       
         Gisele MacKenzie, the Canadian singing star of the 1950's television show ''Your Hit Parade,'' died on Friday in Burbank, Calif. She was 76.         The cause was colon cancer, said her daughter, Gigi Downs.         Although she was known mainly for her contralto voice, Ms. MacKenzie also traded barbs and violin riffs with Jack Benny and played the piano on her own variety show. On ''Your Hit Parade,'' she sang the most popular tunes of the week with her fellow cast members Snooky Lanson, Dorothy Collins and Russell Arms.         Gisele Marie Louise Marguerite La Fleche was born on Jan. 10, 1927, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her father, a doctor who played the violin, and her mother, who sang and played the organ, encouraged her musical talent. She studied violin in her teens at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, but she began singing and playing popular songs on the piano after school. At a party where she sang for wartime sailors, she met Robert Shuttleworth, a military bandleader, who later hired her to perform with his hotel orchestra.         He became her business manager, and in 1958, her husband.         Ms. MacKenzie wavered between a career as a singer or one as a concert violinist until her $3,000 violin was stolen from a parked car. Her vocation thus resolved, she began singing on a Canadian radio show called ''Meet Gisele'' in 1946, her popularity earning her the informal title of Canada's first lady of song.         In 1951, when she began to sing in the United States, she took her father's middle name, MacKenzie, as her last name. In an interview with The New York Journal in 1956, she said she worried that the name Gisele La Fleche ''sounded like a strip tease artist's.''         She sang for two years on Bob Crosby's radio show ''Club 15,'' and when it went off the air, she joined Jack Benny on tour. The attention she gained with Mr. Benny won her a spot on ''Your Hit Parade,'' replacing June Valli.         She appeared on the show from 1953 to 1957, then left to star in her own variety series, ''The Gisele MacKenzie Show,'' which lasted only six months. In 1963 she was on weekly television again, becoming a regular on ''The Sid Caesar Show.'' Over the next four decades, she starred in regional theater and made guest appearances on television game shows and series like ''MacGyver'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.''         Her two marriages, to Mr. Shuttleworth and to Robert Klein, a businessman, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Downs, of Newport Beach, Calif., she is survived by a son, Mac Shuttleworth; a brother, George La Fleche; a sister, Janine Helzer; and two grandchildren.
