        Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said the actress had suffered a rupture of the aorta after having improved steadily from a seven-hour operation.         Miss Ball, noted for impeccable timing, deft pantomime and an endearing talent for making the outrageous believable, was a Hollywood legend: a contract player at RKO in the 1930's and 40's who later bought the studio with Desi Arnaz, her first husband.         She made her last public appearance four weeks ago at the Academy Awards ceremonies, when she and Bob Hope introduced a production number.         The elastic-faced, husky-voiced comedian was a national institution from 1951 to 1974 in three series and many specials on television that centered on her ''Lucy'' character. The first series, ''I Love Lucy,'' was for six years the most successful comedy series on television, never ranking lower than third. The series, on CBS, chronicled the life of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban band leader played by Mr. Arnaz, who was Miss Ball's husband on and off screen for nearly 20 years.         It was a major national event when, on Jan. 19, 1953, Lucy Ricardo gave birth to Little Ricky on the air the same night Lucille Ball gave birth to her second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha 4th. The audience for the episode was estimated at 44 million, a record at the time, and CBS said 1 million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts. Miss Ball's first child, Lucie Desiree Arnaz, was born July 17, 1951, three months before the show went on the air.         The Ricardos were the best-known, best-loved couple in America, and the first ''Lucy'' series is still in syndication in more than 80 countries, at times with six episodes a day in a single area.         Analyzing the reasons, Miss Ball explained why her inspired exaggeration of an average middle-class housewife was credible: ''I believe it all the way. I do what I do with all my strength and heart.''         ''Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS,'' William S. Paley, the chairman of the network, said yesterday in a tribute issued by his office. ''Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever.''         Miss Ball was also an astute business executive. From 1962 to 1967, she headed Desilu Productions, one of the biggest and most successful television production companies. Also, starting in 1968, she and her second husband, Gary Morton, a former nightclub comic, headed Lucille Ball Productions.         She bought Mr. Arnaz's share of Desilu Productions in 1962 with a $3 million bank loan, and she sold the company to Gulf and Western Industries in 1967 for $17 million. Her share totaled $10 million.         Discussing how she became an executive, Miss Ball said: ''My ability comes from fairness and a knowledge of people. I ran my studio like I run my home, with understanding of people. We touch in our house. I tell my children, 'There's so little time.' ''         Miss Ball was a tireless worker. ''I have to work or I'm nothing,'' she once said. ''I've never been out of work except for two hours once between contracts.'' On the set, she was said to know every term, every lighting fixture and every worker. A Veteran of Motion Pictures         Before entering television, Miss Ball appeared in more than 50 films, beginning in 1933 as an unbilled chorus girl in an Eddie Cantor musical farce, ''Roman Scandals.'' Her other films included ''Having Wonderful Time'' (1938), ''Room Service'' (1938), ''The Big Street'' (1942), ''Best Foot Forward'' (1943), the title role in ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1943), ''Without Love'' (1945), ''Sorrowful Jones'' (1949) and ''Fancy Pants'' (1950).         James Agee, the writer and film critic, observed that Miss Ball ''tackles a role like it was sirloin and she didn't care who was looking.'' Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote in 1938 that she ''is rapidly becoming one of our brightest comediennes.'' In 1960 she also starred in a Broadway musical, ''Wildcat.''         In 1964 there was a Lucy Day at the New York World's Fair, and in 1971 she became the first woman to receive the International Radio and Television Society's Gold Medal. Her many other awards included four Emmys, induction into the Television Hall of Fame and a citation for lifetime achievement from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Daughter of a Pianist         Lucille Desiree Ball was born on Aug. 6, 1911 in Celoron, outside Jamestown, N.Y. She was the daughter of the former Desiree Hunt, a pianist, and Henry Dunnell Ball, a telephone lineman, who died when she was 3.         As a girl she spent a great deal of time with her maternal grandparents, who instilled in her a deep family loyalty and a commitment to hard work. Her favorite times were attending vaudeville shows and silent films and acting out episodes and plays. Of a school production of ''Charley's Aunt,'' she said, ''I played the lead, directed it, cast it, sold tickets, printed the posters and hauled in furniture for props.''         She embarked on a show-business career at 15 by going to Manhattan and enrolling in John Murray Anderson's dramatic school. From the first, she was repeatedly told she had no talent and should return home. She tried and failed to get into four Broadway chorus lines. From Soda Jerk to Cigarette Girl         She worked variously as a waitress and as a soda jerk in a Broadway drugstore. She then became a hat model in Hattie Carnegie's salon and also modeled for commercial photographers. She won national attention as the Chesterfield Cigarette Girl in 1933. This got her to Hollywood as a Goldwyn chorus girl in ''Roman Scandals.''         Over two years, she played unbilled and bit roles in two dozen movies and made two-reel comedies with Leon Errol and the Three Stooges. She then spent seven years at RKO Radio Pictures, getting many leading roles in low-budget movies. She was typed and mostly wasted in films, but a few roles suggested her talents - a cynical young actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), a temperamental movie star in ''The Affairs of Annabel'' (1938), a rejected lover in the 1939 melodrama ''Five Came Back,'' a gold-digging stripper in ''Dance, Girl, Dance'' (1940), a handicapped egotist in ''The Big Street'' (1942) and a tough-talking secretary in ''The Dark Corner'' (1946).         ''I never cared about the movies,'' she said later, ''because they cast me wrong.'' A Regular on the Radio         In radio, Miss Ball did regular stints on Phil Baker's and Jack Haley's comedy-variety shows in the late 30's and 40's and, from 1947 to 1951, she played the precursor to Lucy: the hare-brained wife of a Midwestern banker (Lee Bowman and later Richard Denning) in the CBS radio comedy ''My Favorite Husband.'' The show's writers were Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr., who were to write many Lucy scripts in later decades.         On the stage, Miss Ball won favorable notices for a 22-week tour in the title role of Elmer Rice's fantasy ''Dream Girl.''         In 1950, she and Mr. Arnaz tried to sell the ''I Love Lucy'' television show to CBS. Network executives objected, contending the public would not accept the team of an American redhead and a Cuban bandleader with a heavy accent. To prove their case, the couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour with a 20-minute act that included a ''Cuban Pete-Sally Sweet'' medley. They produced a 30-minute film pilot with $5,000 of their own money. The broadcast officials were won over. Premiere in 1951         ''I Love Lucy'' had its premiere on Oct. 15, 1951, and within a few months millions of Americans tuned in every Monday evening to watch the antics of the Ricardos and their best friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz (William Frawley and Vivian Vance).         ''I Love Lucy'' was one of the first shows to be filmed rather than performed live, making it possible to have a high-quality print of each episode for rebroadcast, compared with the poor quality of live-show kinescopes. The change eventually led to a shift of television production from New York to Hollywood. The show was the first to be filmed before an audience, and crew members used three cameras at once to permit motion-picture-type editing. The series won more than 200 awards, including five Emmys.         Jack Gould of The Times offered this analysis: ''The extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce gives 'I Love Lucy' its engaging lilt and lift. Only after a firm foundation of credibility has been established is the element of absdurdity introduced. It is in the smooth transition from sense to nonsense that 'I Love Lucy' imparts both a warmth and a reality to the slapstick romp that comes as the climax.'' Miss Ball's superb timing, Mr. Gould wrote, makes her ''the distaff equivalent of Jack Benny,'' her professional idol. A Fortune in Rerun Rights         Mr. Arnaz made a fortune for the couple by obtaining rerun rights for the series. He later sold the rights to CBS, allowing the couple's production company, Desilu, to buy a studio, the former RKO lot where Miss Ball's film career had languished and where they had met in 1940 while appearing together in ''Too Many Girls.''         Despite the continuing popularity of ''I Love Lucy,'' the couple sought a less demanding schedule and ended the series in 1957 after making 179 episodes. The format persisted, however, for three more years through a series of hourlong, high-budget, around-the-world specials called ''The Luci-Desi Comedy Hour.'' Their collaboration ended with their divorce in 1960. Mr. Arnaz died in 1986.         Two years after their divorce, Miss Ball revived ''Lucy,'' playing a widow in ''The Lucy Show'' for 156 episodes until 1968, then did ''Here's Lucy'' for 144 episodes from 1968 to 1974. In these two series she was joined by her two children, her longtime friend Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon, who succeeded Mr. Arnaz as her masculine foil. In shaping situation comedies, Miss Ball consistently sought superior writers, followed their advice, gave them unstinting credit and paid close attention to production details.         In later movies, she co-starred with Bob Hope in two comedies, ''The Facts of Life'' (1961) and ''Critic's Choice'' (1963), and appeared with Henry Fonda in ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' a 1968 farce about a couple with nearly a score of children. In 1974 she starred in a film version of the stage hit ''Mame.'' Last Series Failed         Miss Ball also appeared occasionaly in television specials and played a spunky bag lady in a 1985 television movie, ''Stone Pillow.'' John J. O'Connor of The Times said she was ''as wily and irresistible as ever'' and ''in total control.'' In 1986, she returned to weekly television as a grandmother in another sitcom series called ''Life With Lucy,'' but it failed to gain an audience.         Addressing a group of would-be actors, she said the best way to get along with tough directors was ''don't die when they knock you down.'' She said she was very shy at the start of her career, but overcame it when ''it finally occurred to me that nobody cared a damn.''         Associates called Miss Ball self-reliant, sympathetic and sometimes tempestuous. ''Life is no fun,'' she once said, ''without someone to share it with.''         For many years she and Mr. Morton had homes in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs and in Snowmass, Colo.         Miss Ball is survived by her husband, her daughter, her son and three grandchildren.         Funeral plans were incomplete last night.       
        Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         Zinka Milanov, the leading dramatic soprano of the Metropolitan Opera for nearly 30 years until her retirement in 1966, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had suffered a stroke on Saturday.         It was generally acknowledged that Miss Milanov was the greatest dramatic soprano after Rosa Ponselle, who retired early in 1937. On Dec. 17, 1937, the young Yugoslav soprano made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Leonora in Verdi's ''Trovatore.'' It was not one of the more fabulous debuts in the Met's history, and critics hedged about the new singer.         But when Miss Milanov settled down after a few performances and demonstrated what she could do, it became clear that the great Ponselle had a worthy successor. In her first season at the Metropolitan Opera, Olin Downes, then the chief music critic of The New York Times, constantly referred to her ''magnificent'' voice and her ''grand manner.'' Virgil Thomson in The New York Herald Tribune wrote that she had a voice ''with a beauty unmatched among the sopranos of this country.''         Everything about Miss Milanov commanded respect, and that included her physical and vocal size.         When Edward Johnson, then general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard her in 1937 at the Salzburg Festival, where she was singing under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, he immediately recognized her potential and offered her a contract that had two stipulations: She had to learn her roles in Italian (up to then she had been singing Italian operas in her native Croatian or in German), and she had to take off 25 pounds. English, After a Fashion         She not only learned to sing in impeccable Italian, but she also learned English, after a fashion. For many years she would order a ''martinelli'' instead of a martini, an allusion to the musical associations with the tenor Giovanni Martinelli.         She was always struggling with her weight and often tried to diet. But she liked to eat, and was herself a good cook, specializing in Yugoslav dishes. Once she took off considerable weight and a critic wrote that the dieting had also brought with it ''a disturbing lessening of her powers.''         Miss Milanov shrugged off the comment. ''You try to do your best to please the public, please critics, please everybody,'' she said. ''Then you lose weight and they don't like you. What you do? You get bugs in the head.'' A Formidable Ego         Miss Milanov was a legend around the Metropolitan Opera in more ways than one. Her ego was commensurate with her stature as a vocalist.         ''I love applause,'' she once said to an interviewer. ''Money is not everything. Money is last.'' Rash was the singer who would try to upstage Miss Milanov at curtain calls.         Stories about her circulated in the house almost from the moment she first set foot on stage. Once, during a stage rehearsal, she looked into the auditorium and saw the team of backup singers for ''Il Trovatore.'' She advanced to the footlights. ''Listen, listen, listen - learn, learn, learn,'' she told the young singers. In a Mischievous Mood         It is said that she could drive her colleagues crazy during performances when she was in a mischievous mood. George London, as Amonasro in ''Aida,'' would be preparing for his big baritone solo. Miss Milanov at that moment would whisper in his ear, ''How's the baby, George?'' Or, in the ''Aida'' Nile scene with a tenor she did not particularly like: ''You're not in good voice tonight, are you? Do you think you can make that high B?''         She could be inconsistent in her singing. It was noticed time and again that Miss Milanov could sing like an angel in one act and have pitch troubles in another.         But there was never a time in any opera when she did not thrill her audiences, and she did so entirely through her voice, because she never was much of an actress. Definitely of the old operatic school of acting, she used the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions that went out in the early days of silent films. But she was a fine musician and never used her voice in an exaggerated manner.         Her singing was refined, subtle, powerful, sensitive or dramatic, as the music demanded. She produced a big, warm sound and had an equalized scale up to a secure high C. In the ''Aida'' Nile scene she was able to take a haunting pianissimo on the C that will forever float in memory. She was equally impressive in ''Il Trovatore,'' an opera that she ''owned.'' Fortunately, she recorded that opera with Jussi Bjoerling and Leonard Warren, and connoisseurs believe it is the greatest performance of that work ever put on disks. Born to a Musical Family         She was born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on May 17, 1906, the daughter of a bandmaster named Rudolf Kunc. The family was musical, and her brother, Bozidar, became a pianist and composer who often was her accompanist for her recitals. She also had an uncle who composed songs for her early recitals. She started singing as a child and made her recital debut in Zagreb when she was 15 years old.         Milka Ternina, a great Wagnerian soprano at the turn of the century, heard the young soprano and took her as a pupil for three years. After graduating from the Royal Music Academy in Zagreb, where she won first prize in singing, Miss Kunc became a member of the State Opera, making her debut as Leonora in ''Il Trovatore.''         Soon she was singing in opera houses in Germany and Central Europe, and appearing with orchestras under conductors like Bruno Walter. Toscanini invited her to Salzburg in 1937 to sing the soprano solo in the Verdi Requiem. She was to sing it with him many times in the future.         She married a Yugoslav actor and director, Predrag Milanov, in 1937. He served as her dramatic coach for many years. Gave 445 Met Performances         At the Metropolitan Opera she specialized in Verdi roles, above all ''Aida,'' which she sang at the house and on tour with the Met 75 times. She also appeared in ''Il Trovatore'' 49 times, ''La Forza del Destino'' 37 times, ''Un Ballo in Maschera'' 30 times, ''Otello'' 17 times, ''Simon Boccanegra'' 10 times and ''Ernani'' 8 times. Her other roles were Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' which she sang 57 times, Ponchielli's Gioconda, Puccini's Tosca, Bellini's Norma (a role ventured by only three sopranos at the Met in the 60 years before Miss Milanov sang it), Mozart's Donna Anna and Maddalena in Giordano's ''Andrea Chenier,'' the role she sang at her farewell. All told, she gave 445 performances with the company.         Miss Milanov became an American citizen in 1946. ''When you come to America,'' she said, ''you get independent like American women.'' At that time, she was getting a divorce from Mr. Milanov. In 1947, she married Gen. Ljubo Ilic of Yugoslavia. Though trained as an architect, he had served as a general with the Resistance in southern France.         At the time of his marriage, General Ilic, a close friend of Marshal Tito, was a diplomat. Miss Milanov left the Met from 1947 to 1951, returning to Yugoslavia with her husband. Accused of Being a Spy         In 1949 she was accused by the Soviet Union of being a United States spy. She said the charge was ''silly.'' Her manager, Jack Adams, laughed at the allegation. He said that Miss Milanov could never have been a spy because she could never keep a secret, and that she was interested only in music, clothes, good food and wine.         She was honored on her 25th anniversary at the Metropolitan Opera with an on-stage ceremony, with Rudolf Bing, the Met's general manager, as master of ceremonies. She decided to retire at the end of the 1965-66 season, just before the opening of the new opera house in Lincoln Center. ''It is better,'' she said, ''to go away on two legs rather than on one.''         In her last operatic performance, on April 14, 1966, she sang the role of Maddalena in ''Andrea Chenier.'' In a ceremony on stage after the third act, Mr. Bing presented her with a Steuben glass cup and Lowell Wadmond, the chairman of the Met's board, gave her a silver tray. Two days later, Miss Milanov made her final appearance in the house. During the festivities on April 16, the final day at the old Met, she sang a ''Chenier'' duet with Richard Tucker.         In her years of retirement, Miss Milanov kept up a lively interest in the affairs of the Metropolitan and devoted much of her time to coaching younger singers (among them Christa Ludwig, Regine Crespin and Anna Moffo). She divided each year between Manhattan and Yugoslavia. Her recent birthday was celebrated with a party for 20 close friends and relatives in her home, for which the soprano, as was her custom, did all the cooking.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Genia Nemenoff, a pianist who toured widely in the 1940's and 1950's as part of a duo with her husband, the pianist Pierre Luboshutz, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Genia Nemenoff, a pianist who toured widely in the 1940's and 1950's as part of a duo with her husband, the pianist Pierre Luboshutz, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Miss Nemenoff was born in Paris in 1905 and began her performing career accompanying singers. In 1931, she married Mr. Luboshutz, who had been her teacher, and the couple moved to New York. In 1937, they made their debut at Town Hall as a duo piano team. Howard Taubman, reviewing the concert in The New York Times, wrote that ''their playing had coordination, boyancy and grace, and on occasion it was searching in its grasp of feeling and flavor.''         Mr. Luboshutz and Miss Nemenoff gave more than 800 performances in the United States before they returned to Europe to make their joint debut in 1952. They toured much of the world, and worked to expand the duet repertory by transcribing such works as Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' Overture, Bach concertos, and Fritz Kreisler miniatures. They also gave the premieres of concertos composed for them by Bohuslav Martinu and Vittorio Giannini.         In 1956, they toured with programs of Mozart's music for two and three pianos, with their nephew, the pianist and opera impresario Boris Goldovsky. Miss Nemenoff and Mr. Luboschutz began to curtail their performing career in the early 1960's, when they accepted teaching posts at the New England Conservatory and Michigan State University, and Miss Nemenoff continued to teach privately after her husband's death in 1971.         She is survived by Mr. Goldovsky; a niece, Irene Wolf, and several great-nieces and great-nephews.       
        Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         Dr. Priscilla White, whose research sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic women, died Saturday at her home here. She was 89 years old.         A statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston said Dr. White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother would often be healthy a month before delivery but would die if allowed to go to full term. She concluded that babies of diabetic women should be delivered early.         She also found that although infants of diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size despite premature birth they require the same special care needed for premature infants.         Dr. White's research and the treatment process she developed increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54 percent in the 1920's to about 97 percent in the late 1970's and 1980's, the center said.         Born in Boston, Dr. White attended Radcliffe College and graduated third in her class from Tufts University Medical School in 1923.         She joined a diabetes practice headed by Elliott P. Joslin, and in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the Joslin center.         Dr. White taught at Harvard Medical School and was an assistant professor of medicine at Tufts. She received numerous honors and was the first woman to receive the Banting Medal, the American Diabetes Association's highest scientific award.       
        Margaret G. Bachner, a retired lawyer who represented the Jewish Board of Guardians in children's cases in the 1950's and 1960's in Manhattan, died on Monday in Palm Beach, Fla., after a long illness. She was 88 years old.         Margaret G. Bachner, a retired lawyer who represented the Jewish Board of Guardians in children's cases in the 1950's and 1960's in Manhattan, died on Monday in Palm Beach, Fla., after a long illness. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Bachner, a graduate of St. Lawrence University, and her husband, Lester, a Manhattan lawyer who died in 1976, were avid tournament bridge players and won the National Mixed Team Championship in 1932. She was a trustee of Louise Wise Services and the Wiltwyck School.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.
