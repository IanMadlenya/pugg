         Eren Ozker, an actress and a puppeteer with the Muppets, died on Thursday at her home in New York City. She was 44 and also kept a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, William Bogert.         Ms. Ozker (pronounced Oscar) was born in Ankara, Turkey, and grew up in Farmington Hills, Mich. After receiving a bachelor's degree in drama from the University of Michigan in 1970, she moved to New York and performed in Off Broadway productions at the Roundabout Theater, the Public Theater and the New Dramatists Guild. In 1975 she joined the Hartman Theater Company in Stamford, Conn., where she took the role of Marya in the theater's first production, "The Government Inspector," and met her husband, also an actor.         In 1976 Ms. Ozker joined the cast of "The Muppet Show," which was beginning its first season. She played the roles of Hilda, the wardrobe lady, and Wanda, an accident-prone vaudeville singer. She also performed in "The Muppet Movie" and "Emmett Otter's Jug Band Christmas," a television special produced by Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets.         In 1989, convinced that puppeteers required their own voice in the acting profession, she founded the Puppeteers Caucus, a working group within the Screen Actors Guild, and was its first chairwoman. In 1991, the guild presented her its Joseph C. Riley Award for outstanding service to the union.         In 1988 she appeared for the last time as a puppeteer in "The Warrior Ant" at the Next Wave Festival in Brooklyn.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sisters: Denise, of Brooklyn; Peri, of Newtonville, Mass.; Shawn, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Suzan, of Pompano Beach, Fla.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.

         Jean Murray Branscombe, who helped develop one of New York City's first vest-pocket parks and was an aide to Laurence A. Rockefeller, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She was the executive director and later chairwoman of the Greenacre Foundation, founded by Abby Rockefeller Mauze. It developed Greenacre Park, an enclave with lush plants and a 25-foot-high waterfall on the north side of 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan.         The foundation also helped preserve and enhance other open spaces in Fort Tryon, Battery Park, Bryant Park and Union Square.         She also worked as an assistant to Eliot Richardson, later Attorney General in the Nixon Administration, when he was a lawyer in Boston, and was an assistant to Nelson A. Rockefeller in New York City and Washington.         She is survived by her husband, Robert F. Branscombe, a retired textile manufacturing executive; two sons: Peter, of Fairfield, Conn., and John, of Manhattan, and a sister, Betty Omohundro of Ponte Vedra, Fla.       
         Barbara Stoler Miller, chairwoman of the Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures Department at Barnard College, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said Beverly Solochek, spokeswoman for the college.         A member of the Barnard faculty since 1968, she was the Samuel R. Milbank Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Culture. Professor Miller was best known for translations of Sanskrit literature, including "The Bhagavad-Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War" (Bantam Books and Columbia University Press, 1986).         She was also an adviser to Peter Brooks on "The Mahabharata," performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987 and broadcast on public television.         Her first marriage, to Dr. James Robert Miller, ended in divorce.         Surviving are her husband, Max Greenwood; a daughter, Gwenn Miller; her mother, Sarah Stoler of Stowe, Vt.; a brother, Will Stoler, of Montpelier, Vt., and her sister, Ann Stoler of Ann Arbor, Mich.       
         Dr. Alice Ettinger, who helped to bring new X-ray techniques to diagnose gastrointestinal illness to the United States and taught radiology for five decades at the Tufts University School of Medicine, died on April 14 at the Norwood Retirement and Nursing Home in Norwood, Mass. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her nephew, Michael Roemer.         Dr. Ettinger was a highly regarded teacher who developed the first radiology residency program at Tufts and practiced at the New England Medical Center in Boston for nearly 40 years.         Alice Ettinger was born in Berlin on Oct. 8, 1899, four years after Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered the X-ray. She received her medical degree from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany, in 1924 and went on to a residency at the Charite Hospital of Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. She received intensive training in radiology from Dr. Hans Heinrich Berg, a pioneer in X-rays of the stomach and intestines. A 1932 Trip Is Crucial         At the time, radiologists had a device, the fluoroscope, that used X-rays to cast an image of the bowel on a screen. But it did not leave a permanent record, and Dr. Berg designed and built a machine, the spot-film device, that captured the fluoroscopic image on film so it could be studied later.         When Tufts asked Dr. Berg for the new device, he sent Dr. Ettinger off in 1932 with the machine in her luggage. Her arrival helped to launch modern gastrointestinal radiology in this country.         She joined the faculty at Tufts that year and remained for the rest of her career. She became clinical professor of radiology in 1950 and was chairwoman of the radiology department from 1959 to 1965, when she became professor emeritus. In 1939 she was made roentgenologist-in-chief at the Boston Dispensary and the New England Medical Center Hospital, and in 1965 she became senior radiologist at the medical center.         She continued as a clinician and teacher at Tufts until 1970, when at age 71 she became a consultant and director of student teaching, overseeing the radiology teaching program at the medical school until 1985 and teaching an elective course. For at least 13 consecutive years, she received the faculty teaching award from the graduating class at Tufts.         Dr. Ettinger's efforts also led to one of the earliest formal training programs for X-ray technologists, at Northeastern University. Among the awards she received was the Gold Medal of the American College of Radiology.         In addition to Mr. Roemer, of Yonkers, she is survived by a niece, Marianne Shoopak of Sunnyvale, Calif.       
         Rachel Higgins Everson, a civic leader and volunteer worker in Brooklyn for a half-century, died on Wednesday at the age of 91 at Southport Manor in Southport, Conn. A longtime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she had lived in Westport, Conn., in recent years.         The cause of death was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Everson, known as Peggy, started as a volunteer at Colony South Brooklyn Houses, a settlement house, in 1924, the year of her marriage to Alfred Hall Everson. She served on many committees to enhance neighborhood life into the 1970's.         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Charles M. Higgins, the inventor of liquid India ink. She was a 1922 graduate of Vassar College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         Mrs. Everson was a past president, chairwoman, board member or officer of Brooklyn's first Planned Parenthood committee, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, United Neighborhood Houses of New York, Colony House, the Brooklyn Central YWCA, Civitas, the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association, the Brooklyn Women's Club, the Brooklyn chapter of the American Red Cross, and the Brooklyn division of the Protestant Council of the City of New York, among others.         In interviews, Mrs. Everson said she wanted to help those who were less fortunate than she had been, especially to give children a more promising future.         Mrs. Everson's husband, an engineer and executive in her father's Higgins Ink Company, died in 1969. She is survived by a daughter, Ann Everson of Westport; four sons, John, of Westport, Peter, of Norwalk, Conn., Robert, of Edmond, Okla., and Alfred Jr., of Palm City, Fla., and eight grandchildren.       
         Sylvia A. Boone, a scholar of African and women's art and the first black woman to be granted a tenured professorship at Yale University, died on Tuesday at her home on campus. She was 52.         The cause was heart failure, said a friend, Vera Wells.         Dr. Boone, a professor of art history and Afro-American studies, specialized in African art, female imagery, women's arts and masks.         In Yale's early years of coeducation in the 1970's, she taught a course on black women and served on the executive committee for the women's studies program. She also organized an early conference on black women and founded a black film festival.         Her writings include "Radiance from the Waters: Ideals of Feminine Beauty in Mende Art" (Yale, 1986) and "West African Travels: A Guide to Peoples and Places" (Random House, 1974). Her work won awards, fellowships and grants. She lectured internationally and was a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums.         Dr. Boone was a vice president and scholarship chairwoman of the Roothbert Fund, which aids students training for education careers. She also served on UNICEF's committee for selecting its annual fund-raising holiday greeting cards.         She was instrumental in organizing the 150th anniversary commemoration of the 1839 rebellion of 53 kidnapped Africans on the slave ship Amistad who were jailed in New Haven for mutiny but were eventually freed. She called the episode "a tale of triumph."         A native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Dr. Boone graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in social sciences at Columbia.         Next she studied at the University of Ghana, where she became friendly with visiting black Americans, including Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and W.E.B. Du Bois.         She started at Yale as a visiting lecturer in Afro-American studies in 1970. After earning master's and doctoral degrees in art history there, she joined the faculty in 1979 and was promoted to a tenured, full professor in 1988.         Her survivors include three brothers, J. Herbert, of Newport News, Va., Edgar S., of St. Petersburg, Fla., and John D., of Los Angeles.       
         Mary Duncan Sanford, a philanthropist and society grande dame for many years, died Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98 and also had residences in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Locust Valley, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died in her sleep.         Mrs. Sanford reigned over Palm Beach society for half a century. She was a founder of the Polo Ball and was active in many charities, including the American Cancer Society, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.         In New York City, Mrs. Sanford was the longtime national chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball Committee, which raised money for several charities, including the Leukemia Society of America and the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.         She arrived in Palm Beach in 1933, newly wed to Stephen Sanford, an international polo star and a director of the Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Company Inc.  He died in 1977.         In Palm Beach, they lived in a mansion, Los Incas, near the winter home of Rose Kennedy, who became Mrs. Sanford's close friend. The Sanfords regularly entertained a wide variety of notables, including the King and Queen of Jordan and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         Mrs. Sanford was a native of Richmond. She attended Cornell University for a year but dropped out to become an actress. She had an early success in the lead role in "Shanghai Gesture" at the Martin Beck Theater on Broadway.         She later went to Hollywood, where she co-starred with Marion Davies in "Five and Ten." Miss Davies introduced her to Mr. Sanfordafter a polo match in Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Sanford is survived by a niece, A. Maxine Warner of Alexandria, Va., and a grandniece.       
         Joan Sperry Rader, who was active for two decades in the Republican Party in Connecticut, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, William Donald Rader.         Mrs. Rader, who had lived in Greenwich since 1965, was a real-estate broker and longtime school trustee. She was elected in 1989 to a two-year term as the vice chairwoman of the Republican State Central Committee of Connecticut, becoming its highest-ranking female officer. She was re-elected to a second, successive term and held the office at the time of her death.         Her many volunteer activities over the years included serving as a trustee of the Eagle Hill School in Greenwich, a private day and boarding school for learning-disabled children and teen-agers. A Brooklyn Native         Since 1981 she had been a real-estate broker with Douglas, Elliman Pickering Associates in Greenwich.         Mrs. Rader was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Edward G. Sperry, who was for some years president of the Sperry Products Company, which manufactured railroad and subway track-testing equipment and other products in Connecticut and on Long Island, and the former Mary Elizabeth Garvin, who was a company director.         She grew up in Oyster Bay, L.I., and graduated in 1956 from Vassar College, where she majored in economics. In 1958 she married Mr. Rader.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Rader is survived by three daughters, Judith Anne, of Boston, Jennifer Caroline, of Springfield, Ohio, and Elizabeth Rader Edwards of Riverside, Conn.; two sisters, Judith Sperry Beavers of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Joy Sperry Emery of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and a granddaughter.

         Jean Bodfish Brown, a civic leader in New York and Chicago, died on June 18 at her home in Chicago at the age of 52. The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Brown was a founding member and chairwoman of the Friends of the Zoo, which worked with the New York Zoological Society to help renovate the Central Park Zoo and to foster environmental education in city schools.

         Patricia Stanton McLean, a retired educator and leader in the dental-hygienist profession, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.         The cause of death was heart disease, her family said.         Ms. McLean retired in 1977 as the director of Columbia University's Division of Dental Hygiene and an assistant dean at Columbia's School of Dental and Oral Surgery. She was a former president of the American Dental Hygienists Association.         Under a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, she developed the nation's first curriculum for dental-hygiene educators and administrators. She was also an author of "Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist."         She was a past chairwoman of the Council of Auxiliaries of the American Association of Dental Schools, president of the Dental Hygienists Association of New York City and an executive board member of the Dental Hygienists Association of New York State.

She earned her certificate in dental hygiene at Columbia, a bachelor's degree in health education at New York University and a master's in administration at Columbia.         After entering private practice and teaching dental hygiene in Tuckahoe, N.J., public schools, she returned to Columbia as an instructor. She was promoted to director of its dental hygiene division in 1964.         She was separated from John McLean, a dentist. He died in 1983.         She is survived by a daughter, Marianne Doran of Pleasantville; three sons, John, of Fort Collins, Colo., Peter of Solebury, Pa., and Paul, of Fresno, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Florence Turitz Bower, a music teacher for more than 60 years, who headed the voice department at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at home in Newton, Mass. She was 94 and had moved to Newton from New York City recently.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, Joseph, a professor in the Harvard School of Business Administration.         Mrs. Bower joined the faculty of the academy as a voice teacher in 1964, the year it was founded. She soon became chairwoman of the voice department, a position she held until retiring in 1991. Her students ranged from classical recitalists and opera singers to musical theater performers.         Before her work at the Academy, she was a member of the faculty of the Henry Street Settlement House and at the Dalcroze School of Music and taught many private pupils.         She began studying music at an early age and graduated in 1919 from the Institute of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         For the next eight years, she pursued music studies in Paris, Berlin and Florence, where her teachers included Egon Petri, Yvette Guilbert and Bertha Fiering Tapper. When osteoarthritis prevented a career as a pianist, she became an apprentice to a throat surgeon in Paris to study the mechanism of the singing voice.         Besides her son, Joseph L., survivors include a daughter, Ellen Feingold of Newton; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Sophia Yarnall Jacobs, a lifelong advocate of civil and human rights, died on Wednesday at her home on Mount Desert Island in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 91.         Her daughter, Charlton Yarnall Phelps, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Mrs. Jacobs was former president of the Urban League of Greater New York and the National Council of Women. She was active in the Urban League movement for more than 20 years and served as vice president and trustee of the National Urban League.         As head of the league's chapter for Greater New York from 1955 to 1960, she fought school segregation, pressed for more public housing on vacant land sites and led action for legislation barring racial discrimination in private housing.  Headed Women's Council         In 1959, Mrs. Jacobs took part in the first "woman-to-woman" exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. She became president of the National Council of Women in 1960 and was chairwoman of the 75th anniversary of the International Council of Women and the national affiliate, in Washington in 1963.         Born in Haverford, Pa., she attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. In 1921, she married Reginald Robert Jacobs, a Philadelphia banker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1937.         While in Philadelphia, she wrote many articles of interest to women, published in Good Housekeeping, Country Life, Harper's Bazaar, Parents, Reader's Digest and other magazines. From 1937 to 1945, she served as executive secretary of the Philadelphia Orchestra Club and then became promotion manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wrote Historical Novel         In 1945, she went to San Francisco as an observer at the birth of the United Nations.         Mrs. Jacobs moved to New York in 1954, where she was an officer of numerous civic and educational organizations. She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Committee on Africa, Howard University, Planned Parenthood-World Population and the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living Environment.         She was the author of a historical novel, "The Clark Inheritance," based on her family's history in the develpment of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. She is remembered by many as Sophy, the group leader, in her friend Emily Kimbrough's book, "Pleasure by the Busload."         Besides her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Denholm Muir Jacobs of Northeast Harbor; 6 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.         She played a key role in Womanspace, a program devoted to women's support services at Columbia University. An amateur painter, she served as administrator of the art school at the Museum at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970's and held private art classes for children.         Born in Brooklyn, she graduated from Adelphi College and earned a master's degree in comparative literature at Columbia University.         Mrs. Cooper's husband, Rudolf, a high school teacher, died in 1968.         She is survived by a daughter, Constance Cooper Batuscheck of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Kenneth, of Manhattan; a brother, David Buxbaum of Milwaukee, and a grandson.       
         Olive A. Beech, a leader in the aviation industry and a co-founder and chairwoman of the Beech Aircraft Company, died yesterday at her home in Wichita, Kan., at the age of 89, her family said.         Under her leadership, Beech Aircraft became a leading manufacturer of private airplanes for general aviation, including propeller, turbo-prop and jet planes. It also won missile and space contracts.         Mrs. Beech's career began by chance. As a young woman, she was hired in 1925 as the secretary to Walter Beech, the director of the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita. They later married.         In 1932 they formed their company as the Beechcraft company, with Mrs. Beech as the secretary-treasurer. While her husband was a talented designer of planes, she emerged as the hard-driving supervisor and shrewd manager of the corporate finances.         When Mr. Beech suffered encephalitis in 1940, she took full command and retained much of that control even after he returned to work.         Upon his death in 1950, she took over as president and chairwoman. She gave up the presidency in 1968 and remained as chairwoman until 1982, then became chairwoman emeritus.         The company grew from having a handful of employees to a payroll of more than 10,000 and annual sales exceeding $900 million.         The Raytheon Company bought Beech Aircraft in 1980, and she was elected to the parent company's board and executive committee.         Mrs. Beech was a past president of the Women's International Association of Aeronautics and a leader in other aviation organizations. She was appointed to national boards by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon.         Fortune magazine twice named her as one of the top 10 women in business in the 1970's. She was awarded the aviation industry's Wright Brothers Trophy and was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame. She was also active in many charitable organizations.         Mrs. Beech was born on a farm in Waverly, Kan., and grew up in Paola, Kan. She displayed her budding managerial talent at the age of 11 when she took over some of the family's financial chores, including paying its bills. She was educated at the American Secretarial and Business College in Wichita.         Surviving are two daughters, Suzanne Beech Warner of Boulder City, Nev., and Mary Lynn Oliver of Wichita, and three grandchildren.       
         Irma Lazarus, a patron and an advocate of the arts, died on Aug. 26 at her home in Cincinnati. She was 80.         The cause was amyloidosis, a cancer-causing blood disorder, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Lazarus founded the Ohio Arts Council in 1965 and was its chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. She also served on the boards of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Ballet, the Cincinnati Opera and the American Symphony Orchestra League.         The opening concerts of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra seasons will be dedicated to her memory.         For 35 years she appeared on television in an informal interview program called "Conversations With Irma," which was carried on Channel 48 in Cincinnati, one of the country's first public television stations.         Her friends included leaders of the performing arts, particularly in the music world. She also was active as a fund raiser for AIDS-relief volunteers of Cincinnati.         She was awarded the 1993 Ohio Arts Council's Governor's award for a half-century of leadership in the arts.         Mrs. Lazarus, whose maiden name was Mendelsohn, was born in Brooklyn. She was graduated from Smith College in 1934.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Lazarus 3d, and their three children: Fred 4th, of Baltimore; Eleanor, of Watertown, Mass., and Margaret Crawford of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; a sister, Eleanor Strauss of Cincinnati; and two children by her previous marriage, to George Rau: Elizabeth Bloch of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and George Rau Jr. of Crested Butte, Colo.       
         Edith Meiser, a stage actress, writer and radio producer, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 95 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said William Herz Jr., a friend.         In a career that spanned half a century, Miss Meiser, a versatile performer with a satiric wit, appeared in more than 20 Broadway shows, including "Garrick Gaieties," "Sabrina Fair" and the 1960 production of "The Unsinkable Molly Brown."         She was born in Detroit and graduated from Vassar College. She made her Broadway debut in "The New Way" in 1923 and went on to appear in "Fata Morgana" and "The Guardsman." Beginning in 1925, she appeared in three editions of the Theater Guild's "Garrick Gaieties," a hit musical revue that spoofed Broadway.         Film audiences saw her in "The Middle of the Night," "It Grows on Trees" and "Queen For A Day," a trilogy based on stories by Dorothy Parker, Faith Baldwin and John Ashworth.         She performed with the Marx Brothers on radio and wrote scripts for Helen Hayes's first radio serial, "The New Penny," and for the "Sherlock Holmes" series beginning in the 1930's.         Miss Meiser also wrote mystery novels and a play, "The Wooden O."         She was a member of the Actors Equity board of governors and the chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater.       
         Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A Boston resident, she was 78.         She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman & Sons funeral homes in Boston.         A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus. For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979. Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.         Born on a farm near Winchester, Va., she became fascinated with fungi that form in garden soil and get into the blood, brain and lungs of humans, where the fungi grow and cause trouble. She told an interviewer after the 1979 award that the fungi "are molds like the ones that grow on bread in the fridge or on damp shoes in the closet."         She trained at Ohio State University, American University, George Washington University and Duke University as well as on the job as a microbiologist. In 1948, she became chief of medical mycology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington.         She left in 1962 to become an associate professor of medical mycology at Harvard University's School of Public Health and advanced to full professor in 1970. Three years later she accepted an appointment as professor of medical sciences at Southern Illinois University and also served as department chairwoman from 1974 until her academic retirement in 1977.         She then worked on foreign-student exchanges for the American Society of Microbiology in what was then the Soviet Union for three years. More recently, she worked as a volunteer at Brigham & Women's Hospital and with battered women in the Boston area.         Professor Campbell is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Flint of Daytona Beach, Fla.       
         Genevieve Sanchez Klein, a former member of the New York State Board of Regents and an outspoken critic of sex education and busing to integrate schools, died on Monday at her home in Daytona, Fla. She was 79.         The cause was cancer of the brain and lungs, said Howard Hurwitz, a friend.         Ms. Klein was appointed to the regents board by the New York State Assembly in 1974, after working for nearly 30 years as a physical education instructor and administrator in New York City public schools.         She was chairwoman of the physical education department at Jamaica High School in Queens from the early 1960's until 1973, when she retired from the school system. Before that, she had taught at Bayside High School in Queens. Denied Re-Election         She was working an assistant professor of health at Lehman College of the City University of New York when she was appointed as the second woman ever to serve on the Board of Regents, which supervises all education in the state.         During her three-year term, she frequently voted in the minority to oppose measures on forced busing of children to further integration of schools. She also voted against a set of guidelines to help school districts select textbooks that dealt with sex or included profanity, saying the rules did not protect the right of parents to object to such material.         She sought re-election to a full seven-year term on the board in 1977, but she was defeated by a vote of 108 to 99 by the Assembly, then controlled by Democrats.         After leaving the board, she was active in the anti-abortion movement and lectured on policy for public schools. She was also active in the Family Defense Council, a group based in Queens that campaigned against curriculum changes advocated by former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. She moved to Daytona in 1990.         Ms. Klein graduated from New York University in 1936 and received a master's degree in education from Colorado State College of Education in 1937.         She is survived by two sons, John F., of Orange Park, Fla., and James V., of Bellmont, Calif; a sister, Muriel Zeigler, of Malverne, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Alice Tully, a philanthropist who was an important figure in New York City's musical life for almost half a century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her lawyer, James McGarry, said the cause was the flu. She had not been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 1991.         Miss Tully, for whom Lincoln Center's chamber-music hall is named, was as respected for her knowledge of music and its practitioners as for her generosity.         As a singer who had a modest operatic and recital career in the 1930's, she was keenly aware of the problems performers face, and throughout her life was a friend and supporter of singers, pianists and composers. After she inherited her family's wealth -- her maternal grandfather was Amory Houghton, the founder of Corning Glass Works -- she donated many millions of dollars to the arts. A Birthday Portrait         For many years Miss Tully made her contributions anonymously, and when she agreed to underwrite a chamber-music hall in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center, she stipulated that her name not be associated with it. Eventually, John D. Rockefeller 3d, Lincoln Center's first chairman, persuaded her to allow the hall to be named in her honor. In 1987, to celebrate her 85th birthday, Lincoln Center commissioned Thomas Buechner to paint a full-length portrait of her, which hangs in the hall's main foyer. Miss Tully always refused to tell how much of the hall's cost she contributed, but she did not dispute reports that said she paid most of the $4.5 million.         She did say that one reason she was hesitant to accept the hall's dedication at first was that Philharmonic Hall and the New York State Theater had been acoustical disasters. "I did not want my name associated with a hall that would have bad acoustics," she told an interviewer in 1987. She changed her mind when Lincoln Center engaged Heinrich Keilholz, who had revamped Severance Hall in Cleveland in 1958, as acoustician.  More Space, Fewer Seats         She took an active hand in the hall's design, selecting the colors of the walls, seat covering and foyer carpeting. She paid particular attention to adequate leg room.         "I had spent so many, many hours cramped in narrow spaces, both here and in Europe, and I felt that this was something we should have," she said in the 1987 interview. "The architects disagreed, because what I wanted would have meant having three fewer rows. So I went to William Schuman, who was president of Lincoln Center at the time, and I said: 'You're a tall man. Wouldn't you like to sit comfortably? Do let us have one comfortable hall in New York City.' "         Mr. Schuman agreed, Miss Tully said. "So I drew a breath of relief. But I had to keep my eye on it just the same."         Later, after much personal research in Europe, she was deeply involved in selecting the Theodore Kuhn Company to build the hall's organ, which experts said cost well over $250,000.         When the hall was in the planning stages, Miss Tully encouraged the creation of its resident ensemble, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and was the chairwoman of its board for many years. She also served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School of Music. Myriad Beneficiaries         In addition to her involvement with Lincoln Center, Miss Tully was an active supporter of dance, art and humanitarian organizations. She gave generously to the Martha Graham Dance Company and Eliot Feld's ballet troupe, and she was a board member of numerous other arts and educational institutions. She contributed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Morgan Library, among others.         Michael J. Spencer, a pianist who founded Hospital Audiences, which provides access to the arts for the disabled, said yesterday that when he began playing concerts in state mental hospitals in the 1960's he sought funds everywhere and only one organization responded. "It was something called the Maya Corporation, and it was only in the early 70's that I found out it was Alice Tully providing the funds." Miss Tully had founded the corporation to disperse cash gifts anonymously. Mr. Spencer added that he received a Maya donation only last week.         Miss Tully never wanted the extent of her largesse known. Irwin Scherzer, the manager of the Chamber Music Society in its early days and a close friend of Miss Tully, said: "She wouldn't know herself how much money she had donated. She did what she thought was best, where she thought it would do the most good."         Alice Bigelow Tully was born on Sept. 11, 1902, in Corning, N.Y. Her father, William J. Tully, was a lawyer and a two-term New York State senator. The actress Katharine Hepburn is her second cousin. When Mr. Tully became general counsel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1908, the family moved to New York City, where Miss Tully attended Mrs. J. D. Randall MacIvor's School. Later she continued her studies at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.  A Recital Inspired Her         Miss Tully often said that she decided to devote herself to music when she was 14 or 15 years old, after hearing a recital by the pianist Josef Hofmann. But although piano studies were part of her schooling, her first musical love was singing. In 1922, after studying voice in New York for three years, she went to Paris for seven years of study with Jean Perier, the baritone who created the role of Pelleas in Debussy's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," and with Miguel Fontecha and Therese Leschetizky.         Beginning as a mezzo-soprano and then moving to the dramatic soprano repertory, Miss Tully made her professional debut in 1927, when she sang works by Gluck, Franck, Chausson and Faure with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris. Six years later she made her operatic debut at the Hippodrome in New York, singing Santuzza -- her best role, by her own estimation -- in a Salmaggi Opera production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana."         She also sang the title role in a production of Bizet's "Carmen" at the Manhattan Opera House in 1935, and through the late 1930's she performed frequently as a recitalist in Europe and the United States. Reviewing a 1937 Town Hall recital in The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote that Miss Tully's program was of "rare interest and artistic distinction" and praised her "musicianly zeal and catholicity of taste."         Miss Tully, looking back on her career in a 1982 interview with Harold C. Schonberg of The Times, said: "It may not have been the biggest career, but it was a good one. I was always concerned with the best in music, and I think I had something individual to offer."  Avid Amateur Pilot         With the outbreak of World War II, Miss Tully settled permanently in New York and continued her vocal studies. But she suspended her career to devote herself to the war effort. An avid amateur pilot, she joined the Civil Air Patrol and flew on submarine scouting missions. But she decided to "be of more use" and became a Red Cross nurse's aid at the French Hospital in Manhattan.         In 1950, Miss Tully stopped singing professionally because, she later said, she felt that her voice was losing its flexibility. Upon the death of her mother, Clara Houghton Tully, in 1958, Miss Tully inherited a substantial estate, and began her career as a philanthropist. It was at about that time that her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln Center, approached her with the idea of contributing toward the concert hall that now bears her name.         The hall opened on Miss Tully's 67th birthday, Sept. 11, 1969, with a program by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. It was judged a superb setting for chamber music, both acoustically and visually, and the most successful of Lincoln Center's concert halls.         Miss Tully, who never married, was a tall, slender, regal woman with a friendly smile, a wry sense of humor, and a comprehensive knowledge of musical literature and the world of performers. After chamber music and art songs, her love was opera, particularly Wagner, and well into her 80's she regularly traveled to Europe to see new productions, keep track of singers and directors, and serve on competition juries. She was especially fond of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; its founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, wrote "Cantilene e Scherzo" and "Nocturne" for her. Others who dedicated works to her include Mr. Schuman, who wrote "A Round for Alice," and Riccardo Malipiero, who composed "Serenata per Alice Tully." Recipient of Many Honors         In 1970, Miss Tully was awarded a Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award. She received the Gallatin Medal from New York University in 1976 for "contributions of lasting significance to society," was a recipient of the first National Medal of Arts in 1985, and received the American Red Cross Humanitarian Award in 1988. A devoted Francophile for most of her life, she received many honors from the French Government, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.         Miss Tully's only sibling, a younger sister, Marion Tully Dimick of Washington, died in 1981.
