         Candy Barr, an exotic dancer whose hardscrabble life became Texas legend as she befriended Jack Ruby (who killed President John F. Kennedy's assassin), dated a mobster, shot her husband went to prison for drug possession, and starred -- unwillingly, she insisted -- in a famous stag film, died on Friday in Victoria, Tex. She was 70.         The Slavik Funeral Home in Edna, Tex., confirmed the death, but provided no details. The Associated Press said she died of pneumonia.         Miss Barr said she was forced in 1951 at 16 to play the lead in a grainy black-and-white erotic movie titled ''Smart Aleck.'' The plot, such as it is, begins with a traveling salesman luring the teenager from the swimming pool into his motel room.         Al Di Lauro and Gerald Rabkin, in their 1976 book, ''Dirty Movies: An Illustrated History of the Stag Film,'' called it ''the single most popular film of the genre.'' They refer to Miss Barr as ''the first pornographic star'' and liken her to Lenny Bruce as a subverter of official morality. The film was not shown in theaters, but was a hit on the bachelor party and smoker circuit.         Many decades after the film and her subsequent fame as a striptease artist, Miss Barr was listed by Playboy magazine in 1999 as one of the 20th century's most desirable women.         For students of the Kennedy assassination, it is her friendship with Mr. Ruby, a nightclub owner, that is most provocative. They were friends over the years, and seven months before the assassination, he visited Miss Barr after her release from prison and gave her two dachshund puppies. He thought she should breed them.         Miss Barr coached Joan Collins on how to portray an exotic dancer in the 1960 film ''Seven Thieves,'' getting credit as technical adviser. Farrah Fawcett conferred with Miss Barr about playing her in a biographical film but never did.         She was born Juanita Dale Slusher on July 6, 1935, in Edna, Tex. Though she told Inside Detective magazine in 1959 that she was fed up with notoriety and hated being called Candy Barr, she went back and forth and never really relinquished the name. At her last public appearance in 1998, to open the Ruby Room at a Dallas club, she was Candy.         As a young child, she said in an interview with Oui magazine in 1976, she was molested by a male babysitter. When she was 9, her mother died. Her father remarried, and she said the harsh discipline of her stepmother impelled her to run away when she was in the ninth grade. A marriage at 14 to a safecracker ended in divorce.         She said a man she met at a club forced her to do the blue movie, sometimes saying he drugged her.         ''I was taken, done and that was it,'' she told Oui.         She dyed her hair blond and progressed from cigarette girl to an exotic dancer well known enough to require a flashy name. She loved chocolate, hence Candy Barr.         She shot her second of four husbands in the stomach in January 1956 after he came home drunk and threatened her. He said that he deserved it, and a grand jury dismissed charges. She soon got a booking to strip in Las Vegas, and, in 1957, played a comedy role in a legitimate theater in Dallas.         Later that year she was arrested for possession of marijuana in a case that drew wide attention because of Texas's tough new drug laws and questions about the legality of wiretapping by the Dallas police. During her appeal, she made $2,000 a week stripping in Las Vegas and Los Angeles to music specially composed for her. Around this time, she dated Mickey Cohen, an infamous mobster in the West.         After the Texas Supreme Court upheld her conviction, she served three years of a 15-year sentence. She wrote a poetry book in prison and emerged in a somber black outfit, quoting Bible verses. Around 1970, she largely disappeared from public view, with the notable exception of a nude pictorial feature in Oui, done when she was 41.         ''Let the world find someone else to talk about,'' she said in an interview with Texas Monthly in 2001. ''I like being left alone.''         Ms. Barr is survived by a daughter and a sister.       
         Shelley Winters, who once described her life as a ''rocky road out of the Brooklyn ghetto to one New York apartment, two Oscars, three California houses, four hit plays, five Impressionist paintings, six mink coats and 99 films,'' died yesterday. She was 83, although some sources say she was 85.         Ms. Winters died of heart failure at the Rehabilitation Centre of Beverly Hills, her publicist, Dale Olson, said. She had been hospitalized in October after suffering a heart attack.         A major movie presence for more than five decades, Shelley Winters turned herself from a self-described ''dumb blond bombshell'' in B pictures to a widely respected actress who was nominated four times for Academy Awards.         Her first Oscar, for best supporting actress, was for her performance in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959) as the middle-age Mrs. Van Daan, one of eight Dutch Jews hiding from the Nazis in an attic.         She won again for best supporting actress as the vicious mother of a blind girl in ''A Patch of Blue'' (1965).         After a series of bit parts, Ms. Winters received her first big break as the waitress who was strangled by Ronald Colman's jealous actor in ''A Double Life'' in 1947.         Four years later, she dyed her hair brown, rubbed the polish off her fingernails, and convinced the director George Stevens that she could play the mousy factory girl who was made pregnant and then drowned by Montgomery Clift so that he could marry the rich Elizabeth Taylor in ''A Place in the Sun.'' She was nominated for an Academy Award as best actress for that performance.         Tough-talking and oozing sex appeal, Ms. Winters was blowzy, vulgar and often pathetically vulnerable in her early films. In movie after movie, she played working-class women who were violently discarded by men who had used them.         When her gullible waitress couldn't lead the hymn-singing preacher to a cache of stolen money in ''The Night of the Hunter'' (1955), he slit her throat.         As a rich man's poor mistress in ''The Great Gatsby'' (1949), she was casually run over by her lover's wife.         In Stanley Kubrick's ''Lolita'' (1962), James Mason married her to get close to her young daughter; when she finds this out she blindly runs in front of a car and is killed.         Even when she became the dominating force in many of her later movies, Ms. Winters often played vulnerable monsters. As Ma Barker in the 1970 cult classic ''Bloody Mama'' -- in which she is first seen giving her four grown sons their Saturday-night baths -- she was murderously maternal while brandishing a tommy gun.         Shrieking, shrewish, slutty or silly, Ms. Winters always seemed larger than life on screen. The critic Pauline Kael called her lovelorn culture-vulture Charlotte Haze in ''Lolita'' a ''triumphant caricature, so overdone it recalls Blake's 'You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough.' ''         Off screen Ms. Winters lived with an equal gusto, which she captured in her best-selling 1980 autobiography, ''Shelley, Also Known as Shirley,'' and in a second book, ''Shelley II.'' With a hearty appetite for food and men, she was not hesitant about naming the actors with whom she had shared a bed, including Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Farley Granger, Sterling Hayden, William Holden and Burt Lancaster. Ms. Winters and Mr. Holden had a ''Same Time, Next Year'' relationship, meeting in his Paramount dressing room on Christmas Eve for five years. Her two- year relationship with Mr. Lancaster  was more serious. She ended the affair when the actor's wife became pregnant with his third child.         She was born Shirley Schrift in St. Louis on Aug. 18, 1922, according to many sources, though others give her birth year as 1920. Her stage name came from the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and from her mother, Rose Winter, an amateur soprano who had once won a Municipal Opera contest in St. Louis. Her father, like many immigrants in the early 20th century, came to the United States in steerage. Her mother, a first-generation American, was born in St. Louis. The Schrifts soon moved to Brooklyn, where Ms. Winters grew up.         When her father went to Sing Sing for arson (he was exonerated later), 9-year-old Shirley retreated into a fantasy world that, Ms. Winters wrote, ''has been a powerful tool in my acting'' but ''used to play hell with my real life.'' In junior high school she discovered she could sneak into Broadway theaters during Wednesday matinees; she never again went to school on Wednesday afternoons.         As a teenager, wearing high heels borrowed from her older sister, Blanche, and with six powder puffs stuffed into her bra, she auditioned during a nationwide search for an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.'' The director George Cukor was kind. Go to acting school, he told her, and become known on the New York stage. She took his advice. Less than a decade later, Cukor cast Ms. Winters as the sexy waitress who serves more than dinner in ''A Double Life.''         A high school dropout, Ms. Winters modeled in the garment industry by day and attended the New Theater School at night, and spent two summers doing sketches on the borscht circuit in the Catskills. She got hired for the chorus of Broadway musicals because she was funny and could sing, but then she got fired because she couldn't dance. She landed a part in the national company of ''Meet the People'' in 1941.         Soon afterward, Max Reinhardt was preparing ''Rosalinda,'' his English-language version of ''Die Fledermaus.'' Charmed by the brash Brooklyn girl who had no idea she was auditioning for an opera, the director gave her a small comic role, which he kept enlarging. When the president of Columbia Pictures, Harry Cohn, saw the show, he arranged for a screen test.         Hollywood was not immediately overwhelmed. As a Columbia contract player earning $100 a week, Ms. Winters made her 1943 film debut with one line in ''What a Woman!'' She took acting lessons at the studio and joined the Actor's Lab to study real acting at night.         Ms. Winters played a harem girl in ''A Thousand and One Nights'' (1945), was lent to Samuel Goldwyn to play the heroine's younger sister in the film version of ''Knickerbocker Holiday'' (1944) and was jettisoned by Columbia after a year for not being ''movie material.''         Finally, ''A Double Life'' gave her a lift. ''To this day I feel that getting 'A Double Life' was a miracle,'' she wrote in her autobiography. ''So much of a successful career depends on standing on the right corner at the exact right moment.''         A seven-year contract with Universal Studios was the reward for her performance in ''A Double Life.'' Ms. Winters played gangsters' girlfriends (''Larceny,'' ''Johnny Stool Pigeon''); a bad-girl cabaret singer whose piano player is Liberace (''South Sea Sinner''); the Marlene Dietrich role in a warmed-over-lightly version of ''Destry Rides Again'' (''Frenchie''); a better-quality nightclub singer who is the object of Frank Sinatra's affections (''Meet Danny Wilson''); a waitress in the Old West married to bad guy (''Untamed Frontier''), and a number of other good/bad girls. As a dance-hall girl In ''Winchester '73,'' her co-stars were James Stewart and a rifle.         For a while, Ms. Winters shared an apartment in Hollywood with a painfully insecure Marilyn Monroe. At night Ms. Winters studied acting with Charles Laughton, who borrowed her from Universal while he directed ''The Night of the Hunter.''         In 1955 Ms. Winters returned to New York. She formally joined the Actors Studio (she had sat in on classes a few years earlier) and starred on Broadway with Ben Gazzara and Anthony Franciosa in the Studio-created hit play ''A Hatful of Rain,'' about the taboo subject of drug abuse.         During the 1960's Ms. Winters found her métier as a character actress. In addition to her Oscar-winning roles, she played the mother of a murderer in ''The Young Savages'' (1961); a middle-age woman who throws away a happy marriage for a handsome young man in ''The Chapman Report'' (1962); Michael Caine's voracious bedmate in ''Alfie'' (1966), and an ex-movie star who has made a bad choice in husbands in ''Harper'' (1966).         Ms. Winters's fourth and last Oscar nomination came in 1972, for her supporting role in ''The Poseidon Adventure.'' She played a former swimming champion who sacrifices her life to help save fellow passengers on a doomed ship, although reviewers found it hard to accept the stout Ms. Winters in the part. The publicity department at 20th Century Fox announced that the studio had told Ms. Winters to gain 30 pounds for her role in ''The Poseidon Adventure.'' But by the 1970's she had simply lost her lifelong struggle to control her weight.         Ms. Winters never stopped working, dividing her time among movies, plays and television. In films she played the witch in ''Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?'' (1971); the perfect Jewish mother in ''Next Stop, Greenwich Village'' (1976); the mother of a fat boy in ''Heavy'' (1995); and Nicole Kidman's selfish aunt in Jane Campion's ''Portrait of a Lady'' (1996). In the sitcom ''Roseanne'' she played Roseanne's grandmother. An early marriage during World War II to an Army Air Force captain, Paul Mayer, lasted until the war ended. Ms. Winters married the Italian actor Vittorio Gassman in 1952. The couple divorced in 1954 after the birth of her daughter and only child, Vittoria, who is now a physician working in Connecticut. In 1957 Ms. Winters married Mr. Franciosa, her co-star in ''A Hatful of Rain.'' That marriage ended in 1960. Ms. Winters is survived by her companion of 19 years, Jerry DeFord; her daughter, Dr. Vittoria Gassman of Norwalk, Conn.; and two grandchildren.         If, during her last years, Ms. Winters fit more comfortably into a muumuu than a sheath, she never lost her sense of laughing delight in what the world had given a poor girl from Brooklyn. In 1996 she defined herself to an interviewer as ''a senior-citizen sex bomb.'' She added: ''I get 1,000 letters a month. I send people a postcard of myself in short hair and a checkered blouse that was taken 50 years ago.''       
         Edna Lewis, the granddaughter of a former slave whose cookbooks revived the nearly forgotten genre of refined Southern cooking while offering a glimpse into African-American farm life in the early 20th century, died yesterday. She was 89.         Miss Lewis, as she was always called, died in her sleep in her home in Decatur, Ga., said Scott Peacock, her friend and caretaker. Mr. Peacock, a chef, had lived with Miss Lewis for more than six years, taking care of her as she grew frail.         Despite a quiet demeanor, Miss Lewis had a reach that extended from her family farm in Virginia, to left-wing politics in Manhattan to the birthplace of California cuisine.         Edna Lewis was born in a small settlement called Freetown in 1916, one of eight children. The farm had been granted to her grandfather, a freed slave. Growing, gathering and preparing food was more than just sustenance for the family; it was a form of entertainment. Without fancy cooking equipment, the family improvised, measuring baking powder on coins and cooking everything over wood.         In 1976, Miss Lewis turned the focused, close-to-nature cooking of her childhood into the first of her four books, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf). The book, considered a classic study of Southern cooking and one that sits on the shelves of America's best chefs, helped put an end to the knee-slapping, cornpone image of Southern food among many American cooks.         John T. Edge, the author and director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, said that because of her devotion to educating a nation about the nuances of Southern cooking, there was no question that the group's first lifetime achievement award, in 1999, would go to Miss Lewis.         He pointed to her recipe for shrimp and grits, a Southern classic. ''It's just butter and shrimp, but it requires great butter and great shrimp, and a puddle of that over stone-ground grits,'' he said. ''This pays homage to the frugal South, but it's also worthy of damask dinner cloth.''         Throughout her life, the politics of race and the swirl of New York drew Miss Lewis with a pull as strong as her Southern roots. She took a bus to New York when she was in her early 30's, eager for work but restricted by the racial attitudes of the times. An acquaintance found her a job in a laundry in Brooklyn, where she was assigned to an ironing board. She had never ironed and lasted three hours before a manager showed her to the door.         She sewed better than she ironed and was soon copying Dior dresses for Dorcas Avedon, then the wife of Richard Avedon. She made a dress for Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Peacock said, as well as the African-inspired dresses that became her signature.         In New York, she married Steve Kingston, a retired merchant seaman and a Communist. Shortly afterward, she became acquainted with John Nicholson, an antiques dealer who in 1949 decided to open a restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan. She became the cook, preparing cheese soufflés and roast chicken. Café Nicholson became an instant success among fashionistas, bohemians and artists.         She remained at the restaurant until the late 1950's, during which she and her husband would argue over its bourgeois character.         ''He used to always say, 'This restaurant should be for ordinary people on the street. You're catering to capitalists,' '' Mr. Nicholson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. ''It was such a bore.'' Miss Lewis left Café Nicolson in 1954, and the couple tried a number of ventures, including running a pheasant farm.         In the mid-1970's, while sidelined by a broken leg, Miss Lewis began writing a cookbook. With encouragement from Judith Jones, the cookbook editor at Knopf who also edited Julia Childs, Miss Lewis turned her handwritten pages into ''The Taste of Country Cooking.'' In 1979, Craig Claiborne of The Times said the book ''may well be the most entertaining regional cookbook in America.''         In a 1989 interview with The Times, Miss Lewis said: ''As a child in Virginia, I thought all food tasted delicious. After growing up, I didn't think food tasted the same, so it has been my lifelong effort to try and recapture those good flavors of the past.''         That dedication to purity of ingredients, taste and authenticity endeared her to Alice Waters and many other chefs. Ms. Waters, whose restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley defined California cuisine in the 1980's, said Miss Lewis was uncompromising but subtle in her approach to food and politics alike.         ''She just had a very quiet way of speaking, and it really engaged you because she was so soft-spoken; you have to listen carefully,'' Ms. Waters said. ''There was a kind of intimacy that you immediately had.''         Ms. Jones, who edited three books by Miss Lewis, recalled her yesterday as a lover of Jack Daniel's, Bessie Smith and understated conversation. ''She had a tremendous sense of dignity in the face of often difficult treatment,'' Ms. Jones said.         After ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' raised her profile, Miss Lewis returned to restaurants, most notably to Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. She remained there for almost 20 years, retiring in 1995. Her husband had died as she completed her first book, Ms. Jones said.         Along with friends, she founded the Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern Food, dedicated in part to seeing that people did not forget how to cook with lard.         One member of the group was Mr. Peacock, whom Miss Lewis met in 1990 while he was cooking at the Georgia governor's mansion. The two developed a deep friendship, collaborating on the book ''The Gift of Southern Cooking'' (Knopf) and teaching cooking classes. Their long association -- between a young, white, gay Southern chef and a widowed African-American doyenne -- earned them the nickname The Odd Couple of Southern Cooking.         As Miss Lewis aged, Mr. Peacock became her caretaker, causing a split with her surviving brothers and sisters, who waged an unsuccessful legal battle to move her to the family home in Unionville, Va., a town about 70 miles southwest of Washington.         Miss Lewis's dispute with her siblings became well known in the food world, most of whose members supported her and Mr. Peacock, seeing him as an eager student to a master of Southern cooking.         ''One of the biggest goals they had was that they didn't want to lose the classic Southern dishes, and this was the binding factor,'' Marion Cunningham, the grande dame of home cooking, said in an interview with The Times in 2004. ''They preached about it, and they wanted to let the country know what the South stood for.''         One sister, Ruth Lewis Smith, and a brother, George Lewis, both of Unionville, survive Miss Lewis, as does a stepsister, Bessie Jones of Philadelphia. She is also survived by Dr. Afeworki Paulos, a lecturer at the University of Michigan, whom she adopted as a young adult in 1986 shortly after he had arrived from Eritrea to study in the United States.         Dr. Paulos said his mother possessed a clear-headed sense of equality and fairness. ''I always say, yeah, the cooking is there,'' he said yesterday, ''but the way I remember her is as a woman who was very deeply involved in social issues.''         Mr. Peacock plans to hold a private memorial service for Miss Lewis in the Atlanta area. She will be buried in a family plot in Unionville.         Correction:  February 16, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Edna Lewis, the chef and author who wrote about refined Southern cuisine, misstated the order of her cookbooks. Her most famous one, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf, 1976), was her second, not her first. ''The Edna Lewis Cookbook'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972) was her first.         Because of an editing error, the obituary misstated Miss Lewis's tenure as chef at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. It was 5 years, not 20. In some copies, also because of an editing error, the obituary misstated the surname of the cookbook author who, like Miss Lewis, had been edited by Judith Jones at Knopf. She was Julia Child, not Childs.       
         Jill Chaifetz, a lawyer who as the executive director of the nonprofit legal group Advocates for Children of New York turned it into a force for reform in the nation's largest school system, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 41.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her brother, Lawrence Chaifetz, said.         In 1998, Ms. Chaifetz joined Advocates for Children, which defends the legal rights of students in public education, and in her time there she quadrupled its staff and budget. One of its goals was the enforcement of standards for the city school system, with 1.1 million students, most of them living in poverty. She sought to empower families who were otherwise without legal resources.         Advocates for Children, which is based in Manhattan, produced many policy papers and reports under Ms. Chaifetz's direction and provided free legal help to students who claimed they were being denied proper educations and services.         In 2003, in one of their most important cases, Ms. Chaifetz and Advocates for Children filed lawsuits against three city high schools, charging that they illegally discharged or turned away students because of their ages, poor grades, poor attendance or pregnancy. Ms. Chaifetz said that the schools had been pushing out many struggling students in reaction to new state standards that judged schools on what percentage of students passed state exams needed to graduate.         After months of skirmishing, the city settled the suits in 2004 and agreed to take back students who had been discharged.         In a memorandum about the settlement, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court said the principles involved, accepted by the city, ''set an important standard for the entire system.'' The cases, he said, ''exposed a lesion -- the alleged 'pushing out' of difficult-to-educate students -- that has been festering for many years.''         Joel I. Klein, the city schools chancellor, whose administration was almost always on the other side of Ms. Chaifetz's recent arguments, said yesterday: ''Jill was an extraordinarily dedicated and effective children's advocate who worked tirelessly to ensure that school reform reached every child. She had a special affinity for the most vulnerable and those who most need a voice, especially children with special needs and English-language learners.''         Ms. Chaifetz worked to help change what she saw as an ingrained culture of discrimination against poor youth.         ''I think kids are one of the last groups of people to be recognized as having fully developed rights,'' she said in an interview in the alumni bulletin of her undergraduate school, Swarthmore College, in September.         Ms. Chaifetz was also an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law.         Ms. Chaifetz was born in New York City on July 24, 1964. She received her undergraduate degree with honors in political science from Swarthmore in 1986 and a law degree from New York University School of Law in 1989.         Before leading Advocates for Children, Ms. Chaifetz established the legal department at the Door, a youth development agency in Manhattan, where she worked from 1992 to 1998. She had previously worked as the legislative attorney for the New York City Council and as program director of a project that helped match law students to needy causes.         Besides her brother, her survivors include her husband, Daniel Seltzer, and their 10-year-old triplets, a daughter, Leila, and two sons, Isaac and Milo, who all have the last name Selchaif; and her parents, Marilyn and Malcolm Chaifetz.       
         Tana Hoban, an accomplished photographer of children who turned her photography into an innovative kind of illustration for books for the youngest audiences, died on Jan. 27 at a hospice in suburban Paris. She was 88 and had been living in Paris for the last 23 years.         Her death was announced by her husband, Robert G. Morris, a photo editor, who said it followed a long illness.         Beginning in 1970, Ms. Hoban wrote, designed, illustrated and published 110 or more titles, a score of them in print, which won dozens of awards. Most were issued by Greenwillow Books, an imprint of the HarperCollins Children's Book Group.         They ranged from alphabet books, like ''A, B, See!'' (1982), to primers for life beyond the nursery, like ''26 Letters and 99 Cents'' (1986); from ''Circles, Colors and Squares'' (1974) to ''Is It Larger? Is It Smaller?'' (1985); ''More Than One'' (1981) to ''I Read Symbols'' (1984).         ''So Many Circles, So Many Squares'' (1998), illustrated with her photographs, educated children to simple geometric shapes. Other recent books, in print, were ''Let's Count'' (1999) and ''Cubes, Cones, Cylinders and Spheres'' (2000).         She offered young readers photo images of things they would encounter as they ventured forth, as in ''Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?'' (1995), with her text and photos. She did the same in telling about demolition and construction machinery in ''Construction Zone'' (1997).         Among Ms. Hoban's early works was an illustrated do-it-yourselfer, ''How to Photograph Your Child'' (Crown, 1953). She contributed to the Greystone Encyclopedia of Photography (1963), and her pictures appeared in books by other authors as well.         Tana Hoban was born in Philadelphia and graduated in 1938 from the School of Design for Women, which is now Moore College of Art and Design. She won a scholarship that took her to England and the Netherlands, and soon turned to magazine illustration and photography.         Her photographs of children prompted Edward Steichen to display them at the Museum of Modern Art for the first of various exhibitions mounted in Philadelphia, New York, Paris and Berlin. In 1970 she progressed from photographs of children to photographs for children.         Ms. Hoban's first marriage, to Edward E. Gallob, a photographer, ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Morris, whom she married 23 years ago, she is survived by a daughter from the earlier marriage, Miela Ford of Rochester; a brother, the writer Russell Hoban, of London; a granddaughter; and one great-granddaughter.         ''My books are about everyday things that are so ordinary that one tends to overlook them,'' Ms. Hoban once wrote about her work. ''I try to rediscover these things and share them with children. But there is more to each picture than a first look reveals. I always try to include something new, something to reach for.''         Correction:  February 6, 2006, Monday  An obituary on Saturday about Tana Hoban, a photographer and an illustrator of children's books, misstated the given name of her husband. He is John G. Morris, not Robert Morris.       
         Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died yesterday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.         With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- ''The Feminine Mystique'' is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W. W. Norton & Company, the book had sold more than three million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many languages.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' made Ms. Friedan world famous. It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960's and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president. In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro-Choice America. With Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug and others, she founded the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971.         Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Ms. Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.         For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Ms. Friedan, with her short stature and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a ''combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis,'' as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.         A brilliant student who graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Ms. Friedan trained as a psychologist but never pursued a career in the field. When she wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.         Though Ms. Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago:         ''Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today,'' Ms. Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface. ''I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily, and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home.''         The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Ms. Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.         Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Ms. Friedan charted a gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career-minded New Woman of the 1920's and 30's into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.         The portrait she painted was chilling. For a typical woman of the 1950's, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children. She cooked and baked and bandaged and chauffeured and laundered and sewed. She did the mopping and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit to the cleaners. She was happy to keep his dinner warm till he came wearily home from downtown.         The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the mass media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream. Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy. Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide. She consulted a spate of doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling and bridge. If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to get her through her busy day.         A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Ms. Friedan interviewed told her:         ''A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy. I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year. By noon I'm ready for a padded cell. Very little of what I've done has been really necessary or important. Outside pressures lash me though the day. Yet I look upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewives in the neighborhood.''         ''The Feminine Mystique'' began as a survey Ms. Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith. It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers. Judging from her own capable life, Ms. Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted. But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling -- a ''nameless, aching dissatisfaction'' that she would famously call ''the problem that has no name.''         When Ms. Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliffe and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same. The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book. They also forced her to confront the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.         Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill. Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who parlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry store. Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children. Only years later, when she was writing ''The Feminine Mystique,'' did Ms. Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.         Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized. She was barred from the fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked on dates. It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.         At Smith, she blossomed. For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things. Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 -- by that timeshe had dropped the final ''e,'' which she considered an affectation of her mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.         At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among others. She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for a doctorate. But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened by her success. He pressured her to turn down the fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount frequently in interviews. She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.         There, Ms. Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide. In 1946, she took a job as a reporter with U. E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America.         In 1947, she married Carl Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive. They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorian house in suburban Rockland County, N.Y.         Ms. Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.; Emily Friedan of Buffalo; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia; a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; and nine grandchildren.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike. The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory. Some critics also felt that Ms. Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, ''The Second Sex,'' dealt with many of the same issues.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called ''The Feminine Mystique'' a ''highly readable, provocative book,'' but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Ms. Friedan:         ''Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues. It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does. What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves.' ''         Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Ms. Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives. After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an N.A.A.C.P. for women.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women. She was its president until 1970.         One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike for Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New York and in cities around the country. In New York, tens of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Ms. Friedan in the lead. (Before the march, she made a point of lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open to men only.)         Carrying signs and banners (''Don't Cook Dinner -- Starve a Rat Tonight!'' ''Don't Iron While the Strike Is Hot''), women of all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched joyfully down the street to cheering crowds. The march ended with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, with passionate speeches by Ms. Friedan, Ms. Steinem, Ms. Abzug and Kate Millett.         Not all of Ms. Friedan's ventures were as successful. The First Women's Bank and Trust Company, which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business. Nor were even her indomitable presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.         Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Ms. Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by members of the women's movement. She was famously abrasive. She could be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament.         In the 1970's and afterward, some feminists criticized Ms. Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women and ignoring those of minorities, lesbians and the poor. Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.         Ms. Friedan's private life was also famously stormy. In her recent memoir, ''Life So Far'' (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.         Mr. Friedan, who died in December, repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Ms. Friedan's account a ''complete fabrication.'' He added: ''I am the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a reckless driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender.''         Ms. Friedan's other books include ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement'' (Random House, 1976); ''The Second Stage'' (Summit, 1981); and ''The Fountain of Age'' (Simon & Schuster, 1993).         The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia, Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years, Ms. Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.         Despite all of her later achievements, Ms. Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with ''The Feminine Mystique.'' Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.         The new society Ms. Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.         ''Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,' '' she told Life magazine in 1963. ''It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams. It is Chapel Hill, N.C., not New York City.       
         Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.         With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- ''The Feminine Mystique'' is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W. W. Norton & Company, the book had sold more than three million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many languages.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' made Ms. Friedan world famous. It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960's and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president. In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro-Choice America.

You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         'The Problem That Has No Name'         Following is an excerpt from ''The Feminine Mystique,'' by Betty Friedan.         The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question -- ''Is this all?''         For over fifteen years there was no word of this yearning in the millions of words written about women, for women, in all the columns, books and articles by experts telling women their role was to seek fulfillment as wives and mothers. Over and over women heard in voices of tradition and of Freudian sophistication that they could desire no greater destiny than to glory in their own femininity. Experts told them how to catch a man and keep him, how to breastfeed children and handle their toilet training, how to cope with sibling rivalry and adolescent rebellion; how to buy a dishwasher, bake bread, cook gourmet snails, and build a swimming pool with their own hands; how to dress, look, and act more feminineand make marriage more exciting; how to keep their husbands from dying young and their sons from growing into delinquents.         In the fifteen years after World War II, this mystique of feminine fulfillment became the cherished and self-perpetuating core of contemporary American culture. Millions of women lived their lives in the image of those pretty pictures of the American suburban housewife, kissing their husbands goodbye in front of the picture window, depositing their stationwagonsful of children at school, and smiling as they ran the new electric waxer over the spotless kitchen floor. They baked their own bread, sewed their own and their children's clothes, kept their new washing machines and dryers running all day. They changed the sheets on the beds twice a week instead of once, took the rug-hooking class in adult education, and pitied their poor frustrated mothers, who had dreamed of having a career. Their only dream was to be perfect wives and mothers; their highest ambition to have five children and a beautiful house, their only fight to get and keep their husbands. They had no thought for the unfeminine problems of the world outside the home; they wanted the men to make the major decisions. They gloried in their role as women, and wrote proudly on the census blank: ''Occupation: housewife.''         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams.

         Octavia E. Butler, an internationally acclaimed science fiction writer whose evocative, often troubling, novels explore far-reaching issues of race, sex, power and, ultimately, what it means to be human, died on Friday after a fall near her home in Lake Forest Park, Wash. She was 58.         The precise cause of death has not been determined, Ms. Butler's literary agent, Merrilee Heifetz, said on Monday. She added that Ms. Butler had suffered from severe hypertension and other health problems in recent years.         In 1995 Ms. Butler was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, the first science fiction writer to be so honored. She received two Hugo Awards from the World Science Fiction Society and two Nebula Awards from the Science Fiction Writers of America.         Throughout Ms. Butler's career, the news media made much of the fact that she was an African-American woman writing science fiction, traditionally a white male bastion. But in interviews and in her work itself she left no doubt that her background equipped her spectacularly well to portray life in hostile dystopias where the odds of survival can be almost insurmountable.         ''I'm black, I'm solitary, I've always been an outsider,'' The Los Angeles Times quoted Ms. Butler as saying in 1998. She leaves no immediate survivors.         Set in time periods ranging from the historical past to the distant future, Ms. Butler's books were known for their controlled economy of language and for their strong, believable protagonists, many of them black women. She wrote a dozen novels, including ''Parable of the Sower'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1993); ''Parable of the Talents'' (Seven Stories Press, 1998); and, most recently, ''Fledgling'' (Seven Stories), which appeared last year.         Ms. Butler also published a story collection, ''Bloodchild'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1995).         Concerned with empathy and with the need to build community, Ms. Butler's work attracted an audience beyond its genre and was widely praised by critics. Translated into 10 languages, her books have sold more than a million copies altogether, Ms. Heifetz said.         One of Ms. Butler's best-known novels, ''Kindred'' (Doubleday, 1979), told the story of a modern-day black woman who must travel back to the antebellum South to save the life of a white, slaveholding ancestor and, in so doing, save her own. Frequently assigned in black-studies courses, the book was rooted in the experience of the author's mother, who worked as a maid.         ''I didn't like seeing her go through back doors,'' Ms. Butler once told Publishers Weekly. ''If my mother hadn't put up with all those humiliations, I wouldn't have eaten very well or lived very comfortably. So I wanted to write a novel that would make others feel the history: the pain and fear that black people have had to live through in order to endure.''         Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, Calif. As a girl, she was known as Junie. (This may have derived from ''Junior'': her mother was also named Octavia.) Her father, a shoeshine man, died when she was very young, and her mother reared her alone.         Always conspicuously tall for her age, Junie grew up paralytically shy, losing herself in books despite having dyslexia. Octavia Senior could not afford books, but she brought home the tattered discards of the white families for whom she worked.         Octavia Junior began writing stories as a child and soon turned to science fiction, attracted by a genre whose limitless possibilities let her imagine absolutely anything.         ''When I began writing science fiction, when I began reading, heck, I wasn't in any of this stuff I read,'' Ms. Butler told The New York Times in 2000. ''The only black people you found were occasional characters or characters who were so feeble-witted that they couldn't manage anything, anyway. I wrote myself in, since I'm me and I'm here and I'm writing.''         Ms. Butler earned an associate's degree from Pasadena City College in 1968, and later studied at California State University, Los Angeles.         As a student, Ms. Butler became a protégée of the renowned science fiction writer Harlan Ellison. Over the next half-dozen years, living alone in a modest Los Angeles apartment, she rose each day at 2 a.m. to write. She supported herself through a series of dystopian jobs: dishwasher, telemarketer, potato chips inspector.         Her first novel, ''Patternmaster,'' was published by Doubleday in 1976. The book centers on a rigidly stratified society ruled by telepathic people called Patternists. It became the first installment in Ms. Butler's highly regarded Patternist series, whose later titles, most from Doubleday, include ''Mind of My Mind'' (1977); ''Survivor'' (1978); ''Wild Seed'' (1980); and ''Clay's Ark'' (St. Martin's, 1984).         Among Ms. Butler's other books are the Xenogenesis trilogy, published by Warner Books and comprising ''Dawn'' (1987), ''Adulthood Rites'' (1988) and ''Imago'' (1989). Her other awards include a lifetime achievement award from PEN Center West and the Langston Hughes Medal from the City College of New York.         In an interview with The New York Times in 2000, Ms. Butler explained the deep appropriateness of her chosen genre as a vehicle for social commentary.         ''We are a naturally hierarchical species,'' she said. ''When I say these things in my novels, sure I make up the aliens and all of that, but I don't make up the essential human character.''       
         Maureen Stapleton, who created a gallery of pugnacious, sometimes profane but always vulnerable heroines on Broadway, in films and on television and who won an Academy Award for her fiery performance as the anarchist Emma Goldman in ''Reds,'' died yesterday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was chronic pulmonary disease, said her son, Daniel Allentuck.         Ms. Stapleton had one of the most honored acting careers of her generation. Her Academy Award for ''Reds,'' Warren Beatty's 1981 epic about the Russian Revolution, came on her fourth Oscar nomination. She also won two Tony Awards and an Emmy among many nominations.         Ms. Stapleton's story embodied the classic theatrical cliché. A small-town girl nurtured on long afternoons at the movies, she came to New York in 1943 with dreams of becoming a star in the theater. She worked at a variety of jobs -- salesgirl, hotel clerk, artists' model -- while attending acting school. Then, not long after her theatrical baptism in summer stock and a few small roles on Broadway, fortune smiled.         It was 1950. Tennessee Williams had written a play called ''The Rose Tattoo,'' and he wanted the renowned Italian actress Anna Magnani to play the lead role, that of Serafina Delle Rose, an earthy Sicilian-American widow looking for love. But Magnani declined, fearing that her English was inadequate for Broadway. Other actresses were auditioned, without success. Harold Clurman, who had directed Ms. Stapleton earlier that year in Arthur Laurents's ''Bird Cage,'' suggested that the producers audition her. After repeated callbacks, she was told she had the part.         A friend from acting school, Eli Wallach, was cast opposite her as Alvaro Mangiacavallo, the simple but loving truck driver who revives the widow's spirits in a tumultuous courtship.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' opened at the Martin Beck Theater in February 1951. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times, called the performance ''triumphant'' and praised her ability to convey not only the coarseness of the plainspoken Serafina but also her moments of exaltation. The play ran for 300 performances then toured for six months.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' fulfilled Ms. Stapleton's childhood dream of becoming a star and also earned her a Tony Award. But the stress of her first major role also introduced the demons that would pursue her throughout her career. She began to drink, though she always maintained that she drank only after a performance. (She routinely vomited before curtain time.) She also became convinced that someday, someone in the audience was going to kill her.         Ms. Stapleton's growing paranoia led her to seek out a psychotherapist after the show ended its tour, but a cure for her ills -- she also had a lifelong fear of elevators and airplanes -- proved elusive. One therapist was to treat her for 14 years.         Despite her problems with alcohol and bouts of anxiety, her life seemed to be on a positive track. She married Max Allentuck, general manager for the producer Kermit Bloomgarden. They had a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Katherine. When word came that Williams was ready with a new play, ''Orpheus Descending,'' she was told once again that he wanted Magnani to play the heroine, a frustrated Italian-American storekeeper in a small Southern town whose world is torn apart by the arrival of a handsome newcomer. Magnani declined again, and the role went to Ms. Stapleton.         The play opened on Broadway in March 1957 and drew mixed reviews, but Ms. Stapleton won raves in the lead role of Lady Torrance, Williams's gritty, sex-starved heroine. Cliff Robertson played Val Xavier, the handsome interloper.         The following year she had audiences laughing in the S. N. Behrman comedy ''The Cold Wind and the Warm,'' in which she played a freewheeling matchmaker. She also received her first Emmy nomination for her work in a television adaptation of ''All the King's Men.'' Then Hollywood beckoned, and in her very first film, an adaptation of Nathaniel West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts'' (1959), she was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress, playing a deceitful man-eater.         In 1959 she and Mr. Allentuck were divorced, and she began a relationship with the playwright David Rayfiel, whom she eventually married. But guilt and anxiety over her divorce, she said, drove her further into alcoholism and indulgence. Her weight ballooned. Liquor was a fixture in her dressing room. ''The curtain came down and I went into the vodka,'' she told an interviewer. She later said that in many ways she had been reliving a painful childhood.         Lois Maureen Stapleton was born on June 21, 1925, in Troy, N.Y. She remembered her father, John, as ''a prodigious drinker'' who had endless battles with her mother, Irene, until they separated when Maureen was a child. She was an unhappy, overweight girl who spent hours at the movies, where, she said, she would ''dream myself right onto the screen.'' She fantasized about someday becoming a Jean Harlow or a Barbara Stanwyck.         When she was old enough to work, her goal was to save $100 to move to New York City and become an actress; in 1943, she left Troy for Manhattan, where she and a friend shared a $45-a-month apartment.         ''I was 17 years old, I weighed 180 pounds and I had a hundred bucks in my pocket,'' she recalled. ''I was invincible.''         She enrolled at the New School, where she studied acting with Herbert Berghof, and in 1947 joined the Actors Studio. But she eventually grew impatient with some of the excesses of Lee Strasberg's Method approach to acting. Even so, she remembered the Studio as ''a special working place.'' Her colleagues included Montgomery Clift, Julie Harris, Marlon Brando, Anne Jackson and Mr. Wallach, and her apartment became an actors' hangout. It was among the happiest times of her life.         Once established on Broadway and in films and television, she was rarely idle. She appeared on Broadway with Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's ''Toys in the Attic'' in 1960 and in the film version of ''Orpheus,'' retitled ''The Fugitive Kind.'' Williams got his wish, though, and Anna Magnani played Lady Torrance onscreen while Ms. Stapleton settled for a lesser role. Ms. Stapleton had an earlier disappointment when Magnani won an Academy Award for best actress as Serafina in the 1955 film version of ''The Rose Tattoo.''         By this time, she was married again, to Mr. Rayfiel, but her drinking was out of control. She was hospitalized for detoxification, after which she voluntarily entered a psychiatric facility. Her second marriage lasted three years. A few months after her divorce, she returned to the role that had made her a star, appearing as Serafina opposite Harry Guardino in a revival of ''The Rose Tattoo'' at the City Center.         In 1967 she won an Emmy for her television work in ''Among the Paths to Eden,'' an adaptation of a Truman Capote story about a spinster and a widower. (When an interviewer asked her if she minded being regularly cast as an older woman -- something that began early in her career -- she merely shrugged and said, ''I was born old.'')         A year later she was cast opposite George C. Scott in Neil Simon's comedy ''Plaza Suite,'' staged by Mike Nichols. She and Mr. Scott played three different warring couples to hilarious effect, and her performance won her another Tony nomination.         The awards and nominations kept coming. She was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for ''Airport'' (1970); she won a best-actress Tony that same year for her portrayal of an alcoholic down-and-out singer in Mr. Simon's laughing-through-tears drama ''The Gingerbread Lady''; she and her co-star, Charles Durning, received Emmy nominations for ''Queen of the Stardust Ballroom'' (1975), playing a couple who warm to romance when they meet at a dance hall.         Another Oscar nomination, for supporting actress, followed her work in Woody Allen's 1978 drama, ''Interiors.'' In 1981, she was nominated for a Tony for ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the battered Aunt Birdie opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role, Regina. In his review in The Times, Frank Rich called her ''a wonder'' and added, ''such is this actress's talent that she can conjure abject terror out of silence and thin air.'' It turned out to be her last appearance on Broadway.         But her movie career continued, perhaps most memorably as the revolutionary Goldman in ''Reds.'' The performance won her the Oscar for best supporting actress. Her film credits also included ''Cocoon'' (1985) and its sequel, as one of a group of Florida retirees rejuvenated by extraterrestrials, and ''Nuts'' (1987), in which she played the mother of a high-priced call girl (Barbra Streisand).         When her grandchildren were born, Ms. Stapleton moved to Lenox to be near family, namely her daughter, Katharine Allentuck Bambery, her grandson Max and her granddaughter Alexandra, all of whom survive her, along with her son, Daniel, of Manhattan, and a brother, John, of Troy. (She was not related to the actress Jean Stapleton, as many people have thought.)         In Lenox she doted on her grandchildren and continued to accept the occasional role, playing a woman dying of ovarian cancer in the television drama ''Last Wish'' (1992) and appearing opposite Armin Mueller-Stahl in the 1994 film ''The Last Good Time.''         She also wrote her autobiography, ''A Hell of a Life,'' with Jane Scovell in 1995, in which she looked back on a life in the theater with a few regrets but a lot of satisfaction. When the curtain went up or the camera rolled, she said, ''I did the best I could.''         But what she loved most, she wrote, was ''the challenge and the opportunity to leave reality behind and become someone else.''         Correction:  March 20, 2006, Monday  An obituary of the actress Maureen Stapleton on Tuesday misspelled the given name of the author of the novel that inspired her first film, ''Miss Lonelyhearts.'' He was Nathanael West, not Nathaniel.       
         Madeleine Pelner Cosman, a prominent writer, scholar and lecturer whose passion for what she called the ''glorious order'' of the past led her first to a career in medieval and Renaissance studies and more recently to wide public advocacy of tougher immigration laws, died on March 2 in Escondido, Calif. She was 68.         The cause was complications of scleroderma, a chronic disease of the connective tissue, her family said. Ms. Cosman, who moved to California in the late 1990's, was for decades a resident of Tenafly, N.J.         A longtime faculty member at the City College of New York, Ms. Cosman founded the Institute for Medieval and Renaissance Studies there in 1968 and was its director for many years. The institute closed in 1993, when Ms. Cosman retired. In the 1970's and afterward, she helped organize the annual medieval festival at the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan and spoke frequently at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and elsewhere about daily life in the Middle Ages.         The author of nearly a dozen books, Ms. Cosman was best known to popular audiences for ''Fabulous Feasts: Medieval Cookery and Ceremony'' (George Braziller, 1976). An illustrated study of culinary practice in the Middle Ages, it also included recipes for dishes like roseye (fried fish in a rose-petal sauce), mulled wine and peppermint rice.         Ms. Cosman took her work seriously. She could sing madrigals, play the lute and eat with her fingers off a trencher in the proper medieval style. Her house in suburban New Jersey was appointed with ornately carved period furniture. Arms and armor lay about, the walls were hung with Flemish tapestries, and the cellar was stocked with mead.         On special occasions, visitors might find Ms. Cosman, wearing a flowing velvet gown, presiding over an elegant table that could include blankmangere en doucette (chicken cooked with cumin and cream, served in pastry) and lentil mawmenye (a lamb and lentil stew). Utensils were not supplied.         Apart from medieval food and birthday cake, the only thing Ms. Cosman knew how to cook was hamburger, a dish that took her nearly 15 years to master. Her family was fond of hamburger, which was always served by candlelight.         Ms. Cosman could also play the piano, fly an airplane and shoot a gun. In the 1980's and early 90's, she made her living buying and selling medical practices, and in the mid-90's, when she was in her late 50's, she became a lawyer. In recent years, she worked as a health-care policy analyst and was a volunteer patrolwoman with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.         At her death, Ms. Cosman was a member of the board of the California Rifle and Pistol Association. She was also on the board of the Wake Up America Foundation, which opposes illegal immigration, and was frequently heard discussing the issue on talk radio.         Madeleine Pelner was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 4, 1937, the oldest of three daughters of Louis Pelner and the former Lillian Rosen. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1959, a master's from Hunter in 1960 and a Ph.D. in English and comparative literature from Columbia in 1964. In 1995, she earned a law degree from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         As a Jewish child growing up during World War II, Madeleine was acutely conscious of the need for self-protection, something she later discussed in interviews. As a young woman, she learned to shoot. If the knock on the door were to come, Madeleine Pelner would be ready. By the time she was in college, her devotion to the concept of personal responsibility had led her to the writings of Ayn Rand, whose libertarian ideas she embraced.         Ms. Cosman's diverse work was united by her interest in the history of medicine. As a scholar of medieval medicine, she found that early medical treatises often included descriptions of food thought to be curative. This led to ''Fabulous Feasts.'' She was later the founder and president of Medical Equity, a brokerage of medical and surgical practices.         Most recently, Ms. Cosman's interest in health care policy led her to study the effects of illegal immigration on the United States health-care system. Her article ''Illegal Aliens and American Medicine,'' published last year in The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, has been widely reproduced on anti-immigration and other conservative Web sites.         Ms. Cosman's husband, Bard, a plastic surgeon whom she married in 1958, died in 1983. Survivors include a daughter, Marin, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a son, Bard, of La Jolla, Calif.; and four grandchildren. Information on other survivors could not be confirmed.         Ms. Cosman also leaves behind a vast library of illuminated manuscripts and a large collection of handguns.       
         Florence Latimer Mars, who defied the society into which she was born to write a searing book about the effects of the 1964 killings of the civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Earl Chaney on her hometown, Philadelphia, Miss., died on Sunday at her home there. She was 83.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Dawn Lea Chalmers, a second cousin. She had been suffering from Bell's palsy and diabetes. An only child who never married, Miss Mars had no immediate survivors.         The author of ''Witness in Philadelphia,'' published in 1977 by the Louisiana State University Press, she repeatedly spoke out against the Ku Klux Klan and other forces oppressing the black population of east central Mississippi. A fourth-generation resident of the area and a member of its landed gentry, she was also a significant source of information for the F.B.I. agents investigating the killings, and she testified before a federal grand jury.         Miss Mars paid dearly for her efforts. The Klan organized a boycott against the stockyard where she sold cattle, forcing it to close, and she was compelled to resign from posts at the First United Methodist Church.         ''Less than 24 hours after I testified before a grand jury investigating those murders (and the church burning that preceded them), the Klan initiated a campaign to 'ruin' me, a WASP lady with eight great-grandparents buried in Neshoba County,'' she wrote in her book, completed with the assistance of Lynn Eden, now the associate director for research at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.         Stanley Dearman, who was editor of The Neshoba Democrat from 1966 to 2000, said: ''There was a lot of animosity toward her for being so outspoken. She had threats against her life, anonymous midnight phone calls, and people driving by her house throwing bricks and shouting obscenities. But she had a lot of moral courage and conviction and was not shakable.''         In his foreword to her book, Turner Catledge, a former executive editor of The New York Times, who grew up in Philadelphia, wrote of her: ''What a witness! She witnessed with her eyes, her ears and her heart. She saw, she heard, she felt and through her own involvement she bore witness to qualities of courage and goodwill that all but evaporated in the climate of passion that flowed from an unreasoning fear of change.''         Florence Mars, a diminutive woman barely five feet tall, seemed an unlikely candidate for the defiant role she assumed. She was born on Jan. 1, 1923, to Adam Longino Mars, a lawyer, and Emily Geneva Johnson Mars, known as Neva.         She graduated from Philadelphia High School and attended Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. She graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1944, and then worked as a reservations agent for Delta Air Lines in Atlanta. In the 1950's, she lived in New Orleans, where she photographed jazz musicians. In 1962, she returned to Philadelphia, raising cattle and owning and running the Neshoba County Stockyards.         She also stepped into the forefront of the battle for civil rights in her town. She allied herself with the Council of Federated Organizations, a consortium of groups like S.N.C.C., CORE and the N.A.A.C.P.         One of her more frightening encounters with the Klan occurred late one night in July 1965 when she was driving home from a party at the Neshoba County fair and was picked up by the sheriff, Lawrence A. Rainey, on trumped-up charges of drunken driving. He dragged her out of her car and jailed her. A member of the Klan, Mr. Rainey was later tried on charges of violating the civil rights of the three young civil rights workers killed outside Philadelphia, and was acquitted.         In June 2005, Miss Mars was in the courtroom in Philadelphia when Edgar Ray Killen, by then 80, mastermind of the ambush of the civil rights workers, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. (The verdict is being appealed.)         Miss Mars was vindicated not only by her friends but also by her foes. At her funeral service on Thursday, Mr. Dearman said, ''People said, 'Florence was right.' People who don't remember how they acted.''       
         Nadia Chilkovsky Nahumck, a performer and transcriber of dances by Isadora Duncan and an influential teacher, died on Sunday in Blue Bell, Pa. She was 98.         Her death was announced by Judith Finkelstein, a former student.         Born in Kiev, Ukraine, Ms. Nahumck came to the United States as a child and grew up in Philadelphia, where she established the Children's Dance Theater in 1944. Later known as the Philadelphia Dance Academy, it became part of the University of the Arts. Her students included Judith Jamison, now the artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         Ms. Nahumck performed Duncan's dances as a member of the company of Irma Duncan, an adopted daughter of Isadora Duncan's, from 1921 to 1931. She performed with Martha Graham in the 1920's. She was also a founding member of the New Dance Group and of the Society for Ethnomusicology.         Moving back to Philadelphia after a serious injury, Ms. Nahumck also organized a college division of the dance academy in 1954 and a private school in 1962 for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. She wrote several notation workbooks and notated a variety of choreography, including dances from the television show ''American Bandstand.''         Her book ''Isadora Duncan: The Dances Choreographed in Labanotation'' was published in 1996. She taught at colleges including the Curtis Institute of Music, Swarthmore College and Temple University.         Ms. Nahumck leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Belle Mayer Zeck, a lawyer who began her career as one of the few women to serve as prosecutors at the Nuremberg trials, died on March 18 at her home in Suffern, N.Y. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her son, John Zeck.         Ms. Zeck was part of a team that prosecuted officials of the German industrial company I. G. Farben for war crimes, including plunder and the use of slave labor. The trial, in 1947 and 1948, resulted in the conviction of 13 of 23 defendants.         Ms. Zeck had joined the legal team in 1946, when she was recruited from her job in Washington at the general counsel's office of the United States Treasury.         After the case ended, she married a fellow Nuremberg prosecutor, William A. Zeck, and returned with him to Suffern, her home town, to practice law. She also became involved in politics, running for the New York State Assembly as a Democrat in 1960 and serving on the party's New York platform committee four years later.         In 1970, she was elected president of the Rockland County Bar Association.         The daughter of immigrants from Hungary, she was born Rosalyn Mayer in 1919 in Port Henry, N.Y. Because she disliked her first name as a child, she had her parents change it to Belle. She graduated from Syracuse University and Fordham Law School.         Ms. Zeck is survived by her daughter, Deborah Zeck Thorne of Nyack, N.Y.; her son, John, of Littleton, Colo.; and four grandchildren. Her husband, who was a State Supreme Court justice, died in 2002.       
         Muriel Spark, known for her finely polished, darkly comic prose and for the unforgettable Miss Jean Brodie, one of the funniest and most sinister characters in modern fiction, died Friday at a hospital in Florence, Italy. She was 88.         Ms. Spark's death was announced yesterday, The Associated Press reported, by Massimiliano Dindalini, the mayor of the Tuscan village of Civitella della Chiana, where she had lived for almost 30 years.         Her work, unlocked from her innermost memories of her experiences before and after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954, built a canon of short, sometimes macabre, sometimes humorous novels that sought to pare away the absurdities of human behavior.         Ms. Spark's first novel was published when she was 39, and after that she supplied a stream of slender novels and enigmatic short stories peopled with such curiosities as narrators from beyond the grave, flying saucers, grandmotherly smugglers with bread bins full of diamond-studded loaves and individuals of so little substance that they disappear when the door closes.         In her writing, evil is never far away, violence is a regular visitor and death is a constant companion. Her themes were generally serious but nearly always handled with a feather-light touch.         It is this lightness, and a contrived detachment toward her characters, that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work, which at her death included more than 20 novels, several collections of short stories, poetry, criticism, biography, plays and a handful of children's books.         Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent -- sometimes quite merrily -- to terrible deaths.         ''People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone,'' she said in an interview in The New Yorker. ''I'm often very deadpan, but there's a moral statement too, and what it's saying is that there's a life beyond this, and these events are not the most important things. They're not important in the long run.''         She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1, 1918, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland, and his wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell, a Protestant from a country village near London.         When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie's High School for Girls, where she became one of the crème de la crème of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay, the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1961), which was later adapted for the stage and film.         Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief, and as she had put it, ''disastrous,'' marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa.         He was known as S. O. S., a fitting nickname, it turned out, when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years. ''He became a borderline case, and I didn't like what I found on either side of the border,'' she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, ''Curriculum Vitae.''         They lived in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and their union produced her only child, a son, Robin.         She kept the name Spark, partly for her son's sake and partly because she thought it had ''some ingredient of life and of fun.''         She longed to return to Britain, but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel. She finally succeeded in returning aboard a troopship in 1944, leaving her son, then 6, in the care of convent nuns in Central Africa until the war was over.         Once home, she went to London in search of work, taking up residence at the Helena Club, which later became the model for the May of Teck Club, the setting for her 1963 novel, ''The Girls of Slender Means.''         Propaganda and Poetry         In London she landed a job with the Foreign Office in a secret division that disseminated black propaganda, a brand of disinformation she described as ''detailed truth with believable lies.'' The reports, broadcast on what masqueraded as a German radio station, used real names and addresses to lend veracity to invented stories, and the announcers were German prisoners of war. Although the fabricated news items were aimed at undermining the Nazis, there were times when they worked too well and surfaced as news in the British press.         After the war she worked at a jewelry trade publication, Argentor, in London, joined the Poetry Society and later became editor of its Poetry Review, a job that lasted for two tempestuous years before she was dismissed. Her innovations there included paying for worthy submissions and ending the practice of accepting payments from poets, a change that drastically altered the content of the review and outraged its establishment.         She founded a short-lived literary magazine, then went to work for a publishing house, devoting the remainder of her time to writing poetry, doing book reviews and writing and editing scholarly works, including the letters of John Henry Cardinal Newman.         Ms. Spark said she discovered through the writings of Cardinal Newman that the foundations of the Roman Catholic church corresponded with her personal convictions. She described her conversion to Catholicism as a natural step in her life. ''There was no blinding revelation in my case,'' she wrote in her autobiography.         Her first novel, ''The Comforters'' (1957), was born of religion and delusions. Newly converted and living in London in 1954, during the period of postwar food rationing, Ms. Spark ate little and chased away her hunger with Dexedrine, a combination that led to a period of hallucinations. The words she had once manipulated turned on her, trapping her in a fog of anagrams and crosswords and convincing her that a code ran through the literature she read.         After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Ms. Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, ''took the edge off cold charity.''         In ''The Comforters,'' a young woman recovering from a breakdown finds that she is a character in a novel that is being written on a phantom typewriter that only she can hear.         Religion is present in Ms. Spark's work in a variety of guises, from the unseen and unforgiving hand in ''Memento Mori'' (1959) to the hypocrisy of self-righteously pious characters like the couple in the short story ''The Black Madonna.'' Later in her life, the issue of her religious heritage became a persistent irritant.         She traced the seeds of ''Memento Mori,'' her third novel, to her childhood, when she learned about old age and human frailty at close range, caring for her dying grandmother. Although the novel is steeped in death and deception it is at times unabashedly hilarious. In the book, one elderly person after another in a close circle gets a mysterious phone call with a simple message: ''Remember, you must die.'' This slim novel about confronting mortality, packed with sex, blackmail and mystery, was adapted for the stage.         While Ms. Spark's books cover a broad territory of plot and character, some central similarities can be found in many of the novels and short stories.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review of Ms. Spark's novel ''Reality and Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1997, described the author's approach as a recipe: ''Take a self-enclosed community (of writers, schoolgirls, nuns, rich people, etc.) that is full of incestuous liaisons and fraternal intrigue; toss in a bombshell (like murder, suicide or betrayal) that will ricochet dangerously around this little world; and add some allusions to the supernatural to ground these melodramatics in an old-fashioned context of good and evil. Serve up with crisp, authoritative prose and present with 'a light and heartless hand.' ''         Delving Into School Secrets         This recipe appears with variations in novels including ''The Ballad of Peckham Rye'' (1960) , in which a truly devilish young man who calls himself an industrial analyst insinuates himself into the life of a community and goes about creating suspicion among neighbors, delving into personal secrets and destroying lives.         It reappears in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which provides a memorable example of a small and controlled community -- a girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930's -- in which the imperious teacher molds lives in a way few educators can.         ''Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she will be mine for life,'' intones the elegant Miss Brodie, who does not care whether her charges know their history or arithmetic as long as they have an appreciation of the finer things: art, Mussolini, proper care of the complexion, Franco.         She captivates her students and enriches their lives while exerting unnatural control, grooming them to serve her will, whether in the bed of one of her lovers, as her personal spy or as a martyr to one of her political causes. Her single-mindedness in devoting her ''prime'' to her students has consequences for every life she touches, from the men who love her to the student who is the author of her undoing.         Jay Presson Allen's adaptation for the stage became a vehicle in London in 1964 for Vanessa Redgrave, on Broadway in 1968 for Zoe Caldwell, who won a Tony for her performance, and in Hollywood in 1969 for Maggie Smith, who won an Oscar for best actress in the role.         No other book by Ms. Spark has received the widespread popular acclaim and exposure of ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' but in subsequent interviews, the author expressed a firm preference for dwelling on the future rather than the past.         In 1965 she published ''The Mandelbaum Gate,'' a heftier book and one that seems overstuffed by her standards. Set in Jerusalem against the backdrop of the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, ''The Mandelbaum Gate'' tackles questions of religion, memory and history superimposed on a torturous plot. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial prize.         In ''The Driver's Seat,'' published in 1970, a woman embarks on a wild search through Europe for the man who will kill her. With ''Hothouse on the East River'' in 1973, she moved the locale to New York, and the next year she responded to the Watergate scandal with ''The Abbess of Crewe,'' her own tale of burglars and stolen secrets set in yet another type of institution -- a convent. ''The Only Problem,'' in 1984, returns to the book of Job for inspiration.         Divine retribution of a sort neatly ties up her book ''Aiding and Abetting'' (2000), a fictional tale of a real man, Lord Lucan, known as Lucky, who killed his children's nanny, whom he apparently mistook for his wife in the dark, severely battered his wife, then disappeared, with the help of his friends. In the novel, two men claim to be the aging Lord Lucan, and both present themselves to a very high-priced Paris therapist who is fleeing her own past -- that of a fraudulent stigmatic.         Her last book, ''The Finishing School'' (2004), revisits the themes of boarding schools and envy.         Ms. Spark was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1967, became a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and in 1997 won the David Cohen Literature Prize for lifetime achievement.         She took issue, however, with the label ''British writer.'' She told one interviewer, ''I am Scottish by formation.'' She pointed out repeatedly that the bulk of her life had been spent in other countries. After London, she lived briefly in New York in the 1960's, then abandoned the crush of the literary world for Rome, where she had a rich social life and entertained lavishly.         Alliance and Estrangement         In Rome, she met the painter and sculptor Penelope Jardine, who became her secretary and later her companion. The two women traveled together, lived together, and over the years their lives grew deeply intertwined.         Interviewers repeatedly asked about the nature of the relationship of the two women who spent so many years together. Ms. Spark brushed aside the idea that their involvement was romantic; it was characterized as an ''old-fashioned friendship.''         Ms. Jardine purchased a sprawling medieval church compound in Tuscany, and they ultimately settled there. There Ms. Spark settled into her routine of writing in her favorite composition books, in longhand, using only pens untouched by other human hands, and rarely rewriting or revising what flowed from those pens. Ms. Jardine handled the business of everyday life, down to the typing of Ms. Spark's work.         When asked in an interview what she contributed to the household, Ms. Spark said she made her own bed, took morning tea to Ms. Jardine and took her out to meals. ''I think I pull my weight somehow or other,'' she said.         She saw her craft, she said in a 2004 interview, as driven by inspiration from an ''outside force'' unlocking memory in a manner derived from her reading of Marcel Proust.         ''It inspired me more than anything,'' she said at the time. ''I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found I rather liked writing prose.''         In her later years it became clear that she and her son, Robin, a painter who lives in Edinburgh, were irreconcilably estranged over various issues, including what he referred to as her abandonment of him, as well as her opinions about his ability as an artist and his public statements about their heritage.         Ms. Spark was harsh in her public criticism of his work and open about their estrangement. She told a newspaper: ''He can't sell his lousy paintings, and I have had a lot of success. He keeps sending them to me and I don't know what to do with them. I can't put them on my wall. He's never done anything for me, except for being one big bore.''         Their public feud extended to their religions and spilled into letters to newspapers and became a part of Ms. Spark's literary history when she donated letters from her son to the National Library of Scotland. Mr. Spark, who embraced Judaism about the same time his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, insisted that her mother had been Jewish, which by matrilineal inheritance would make him Jewish by birth; Ms. Spark, who considered herself only half-Jewish, maintained that though her father was Jewish, her mother was not.         Critics have disagreed on how to classify her work, which is alternately bleak and side-splitting. John Updike spoke of ''fun-house plots, full of trapdoors, abrupt apparitions and smartly clicking secret panels.'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called her a ''profoundly serious comic writer whose wit advances, never undermines or diminishes, her ideas.''         Taking the opposite view, Robert Maurer questioned the emotional underpinnings of her fiction, writing, ''One wonders how vast a reserve of sympathy lies beneath the iceberg of her consciousness, and how far beyond trickery her work would go if she let it show through.''         Ms. Spark said in several interviews that she would rather not fit neatly into any literary category. ''I have a comic strain, but my novels are serious,'' she said in 1993. ''Sometimes one makes one's own category, you know.''         Correction:  July 18, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary on April 16 about the novelist Muriel Spark misstated the date of her death. It was April 13, not April 14. The error was pointed out by a reader last week; the correction was further delayed for research.       
         Luba Kadison Buloff, who went from playing children's roles to reigning as a leading lady in the Yiddish theater, helping bring its flavorful blend of wrenching drama and comedic shrug from Europe to the Lower East Side in the 1920's, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99.         Her daughter and sole survivor, Barbara Buloff of Manhattan, confirmed the death.         Over five decades, billed as Luba Kadison, she played 7-year-old walk-ons, teenage ingénues and then starring roles in works by the greatest playwrights of Yiddish theater, including I. S. Singer and Sholem Asch. Often she co-starred with her husband, Joseph Buloff, whom she met in Poland. Mr. Buloff, who later moved on to well-known roles on Broadway, died in 1985.         In her later years, Ms. Kadison was an interpreter for Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union and an acting teacher. She was also a voice of history, consulted by theater researchers like Caraid O'Brien, who is writing on a book on the Yiddish theater.         ''She was an incredible mentor to a lot of young people and acting students,'' Ms. O'Brien said. ''Even though she never went to college, she was the most beautifully educated person I've ever known,'' Ms. O'Brien added. ''She taught me Yiddish.''         ''On Stage, Off Stage: Memories of a Lifetime in the Yiddish Theater,'' which she and her husband wrote with Irving Genn, was published in 1992 by the Judaica Division, Harvard College Library.         Luba Kadison was born on Dec. 14, 1906, in Kovno (now called Kaunas), in Lithuania. During World War I, her family moved to the capital, Vilnius, where her father, Leib Kadison, became a founder and the director of the Vilna Troupe. The company gained fame for its production of ''The Dybbuk,'' by S. Ansky, with Ms. Kadison at first playing a small part, but later taking over the lead role of Leah, the bride possessed by the title character, a malicious spirit.         Soon after the war, the Vilna Troupe moved to Warsaw, where Mr. Buloff joined the company. In addition to acting, he directed ''Yoshke Muzicant'' by Osip Dimov, a folk tale told through the eyes of a child. Ms. Kadison, still a teenager, played the lead. She and Mr. Buloff were married in 1923.         Five years later, the American impresario Maurice Schwartz invited the couple to New York to join his Yiddish Art Theater, on Second Avenue and 12th Street. There Ms. Kadison played opposite Stella Adler in Sholem Asch's ''God of Vengeance,'' among many other roles over the next 30 years.         While Mr. Buloff began to get parts on Broadway, including the peddler Ali Hakim in the original production of ''Oklahoma,'' Ms. Kadison continued to play leading roles with the Yiddish Art Theater, including Dina, the spoiled wife, in the ''Brothers Ashkenazi,'' by I. J. Singer, and Malkeleh, a disturbed girl, in Singer's ''Yoshe Kalb.'' In one of her most famous performances, she played Linda, Willy Loman's suffering wife, in the Yiddish production of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman.''       
         Judith Moore, the author of ''Fat Girl,'' a searingly angry and widely praised memoir about being overweight, died on May 15 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 66.         The cause was colon cancer, said her daughter Rebecca Moore.         ''I am a short, squat toad of a woman,'' Ms. Moore wrote in ''Fat Girl,'' which was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award last year when it was published.         She continued: ''My upper arms are as big as those maroon-skinned bolognas that hang from butchers' ceilings. My belly juts out. The skin on my thighs is pocked.''         ''I hate myself,'' she wrote. ''I have almost always hated myself.''         At the heart of ''Fat Girl'' is the story of a brutal childhood. Ms. Moore was born in Stillwater, Okla. Her parents divorced when she was young. Her father, a lawyer, was obese, her mother slender. As a child Ms. Moore was shuttled between her mother and her maternal grandmother, both of whom beat her, she said. But her grandmother liked to cook, and so Judith devoured food, desperate to fill the emptiness inside her. And as she grew fat, both women derided her.         Yet alongside the bitterness in ''Fat Girl'' are sensuous descriptions of food, ''three-layer coconut cakes and huckleberry and peach and boysenberry cobblers, crisp gingerbread cookies, Kadota figs afloat in clotted cream, cows' thick milk.''         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, the author Jane Stern called the book ''brilliant and angry and unsettling.''         With her mordant humor and tart style, Ms. Moore was sometimes compared to another California writer, Joan Didion.         Ms. Moore published two earlier books. ''The Left Coast of Paradise: California and the American Heart,'' a collection of essays published in 1987, included pieces on the political philosopher Herbert Marcuse, on a neurotic elephant and on a philosophically minded pimp. ''Never Eat Your Heart Out,'' in 1997, was also a memoir about her life and food, though without the anger of ''Fat Girl.''         Ms. Moore was also a senior editor at The San Diego Reader, a weekly newspaper, where she was known for her almost uncanny intuition about how to bring out the best in writers.         Ms. Moore married and divorced twice. In addition to Rebecca, of Dunedin, Fla., she is survived by a second daughter, Sarah Sullivan of Tacoma, Wash., and a grandson.         Though Ms. Moore wrote in tones of self-loathing about being fat, and was at times overweight, she was not morbidly obese. Sometimes her weight was within normal range, Rebecca Moore said.         So why did she always portray herself in books as a huge woman, hideous in her immensity? ''It was essentially what was beaten into her,'' Rebecca Moore said. ''No matter how fat she was, or how thin, she was always that fat girl.''       
         Dika Newlin, who composed a symphony at 11, became a distinguished composer and musicologist and emerged, in her 70's and 80's, as a most unlikely punk rocker, died on July 22 in Richmond, Va. She was 82.         The cause was complications of a broken arm she suffered on June 30, said Sabine Feisst, a professor of musicology at Arizona State University who is writing a book on Dr. Newlin.         ''It is hard to find out about me because I'm involved in so many different things,'' Dr. Newlin said in an interview with The Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1996. One continuing thread: she was a professor at various universities, until her retirement from Virginia Commonwealth University two years ago.         Her latest incarnation was as leather-clad, bright-orange-haired punk rocker and occasional Elvis impersonator, belting out songs like ''Love Songs for People Who Hate Each Other,'' which she wrote herself. Her flamboyant image was not exactly dulled when she posed in her 70's for a pinup calendar.         Dr. Newlin's earlier prominence grew out of her studies as a teenager with the composer Arnold Schoenberg. Dr. Newlin, among the last surviving pupils of Schoenberg, wrote the entry on him for the Encyclopaedia Britannica.         Dr. Feisst called Dr. Newlin ''one of the pioneers of Schoenberg research in America.'' Dr. Newlin's doctoral dissertation was published as the book ''Bruckner, Mahler, Schoenberg'' (1947, 1968). She also translated Schoenberg's works from German to English, and her publication of diaries she kept as his student provide some of the most intimate glimpses of him.         Dr. Newlin's own compositions reflect Schoenberg's innovative approach. Those works include three operas, a chamber symphony, a piano concerto and numerous chamber, vocal and mixed-media works. In 1999, she sang in a costumed performance of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' in her own English translation, in Lubbock, Tex.         In her punk incarnation, Dr. Newlin appeared in horror movies produced by Michael D. Moore in Richmond. In ''Creep'' (1995), directed by Tim Ritter, her character, clad in a leather motorcycle jacket, poisons baby food on a supermarket shelf.         Dr. Feisst confessed to finding this sort of thing ''puzzling and disturbing'' but said she came to view it as ''all part of the package.''         Mr. Moore also directed ''Dika: Murder City'' (1995), a documentary about Dr. Newlin.         Dika Newlin, an only child, was born in Portland, Ore., on Nov. 22, 1923. Her name, chosen by her mother, refers to an Amazon in one of Sappho's poems.         Her parents, both academics, soon moved to East Lansing, Mich., to teach at what is now Michigan State University. Dika could read dictionaries at 3, played the piano at 6 and began composing at 7.         She entered grade school at 5 and finished at 8. At 11, she wrote a symphonic piece, ''Cradle Song.'' Three years later, it was performed by the Cincinnati Symphony, with Vladimir Bakaleinikoff conducting.         She finished high school at 12 and was accepted as a college student by Michigan State, where, The New York Herald Tribune said in 1939, she had the highest I.Q. score in the school's history. At the time of the article, she was in New York to hear one of her compositions performed at the World's Fair.         After graduating from Michigan State at 16, she settled with her mother in Los Angeles so that she could attend the University of California at Los Angeles and study with Schoenberg, who taught there. She kept a diary, which she published as a book, ''Schoenberg Remembered: Diaries and Recollections (1938-76),'' in 1980.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Joan Peyser marveled at its ''absolute ingenuousness,'' saying Dr. Newlin seemed to have censored nothing.         In one entry, she tells how Schoenberg, an Austrian émigré she called Uncle Arnold, criticized her string-quartet style as ''too pianistic.'' She replied that she knew it wasn't the best writing. The entry continues, ''He replied, 'No, it is not the best, nor even the second best -- perhaps the 50th best, yes?' ''         She earned her doctorate in musicology from Columbia at 22. She studied piano with Artur Schnabel and Rudolf Serkin and made a half-dozen piano recordings in the United States and Europe. Many years later, in 2004, some of her punk numbers were released on an album called ''Ageless Icon: The Greatest Hits of Dika Newlin.''         Dr. Newlin, who never married, leaves no immediate family members. She has a surviving cousin and was close to her cat, Spot. She once kept eight or more cats. Reporters noted that she slept on a mattress on the floor with a medieval suit of armor dangling above.         She told The Richmond Times-Dispatch that she had always wanted to have a rock band, and hers surely carried her own brand. Who but Dr. Newlin could have taken the text Schoenberg used for the fourth movement of his second string quartet to use as punk lyrics for ''Alien Baby''?         ''I feel like a child more than I did as a child,'' she said in an interview with People magazine in 2003. ''I try more and more to live day by day, to do something because it feels good.''       
         Louise Simone Bennett-Coverly, a Jamaican poet and folklorist who became the voice of the island's culture at home and abroad, died on Wednesday in Toronto. She was 86.         Her death was announced by the Jamaica Information Service, which did not give a cause. She was hospitalized in Toronto after collapsing late Tuesday night.         A social commentator who liberally used Jamaican patois and made famous the Jamaican catchphrase ''Walk good,'' she brought an overwhelming talent to the stage, radio, television and movies. She also was a presenter on the BBC's Caribbean Service.         Louise Bennett, known to her fans worldwide as Miss Lou, was born on North Street in Kingston on Sept. 7, 1919, the only child of Cornelius Bennett, a baker, and Kerene Robinson, a dressmaker. Her father died when she was young, and she was reared mostly by her mother.         Ms. Bennett was educated in Jamaican schools, and though she was fond of literature, she once described herself as ''an average student.''         In 1936 she made her first public appearance, on Christmas Day at a concert, reciting a poem in Jamaican dialect. She was presented a prize of two guineas by the impresario Eric Winston Coverly, better known as Chalk Talk, who became her husband in 1954. She used the money to buy a pair of shoes.         She continued to write in dialect, following in the footsteps of the well-known Jamaican poet Claude McKay, although he only flirted with the style.         Not surprisingly, Ms. Bennett was ostracized by educated Jamaicans who saw the local patois as inferior to the Oxford English they tried to speak.         The island's newspaper The Gleaner refused at first to publish her poems, but later paid her for a regular Sunday column, which became popular.         Her published verse originated mostly as print or radio journalism, and her monologues often referred to the news, with shrewd social and political commentary. She invented the character of Aunty Roachy on the radio to ridicule the authorities with wit, sometimes ending her monologues with local proverbs.         Ms. Bennett performed in her first Christmas pantomime in 1943, and she and the stage actor Ranny Williams immediately became the leading duo of Jamaican theater. Together they wrote ''Anancy and Beeny Bud'' (1958), ''Jamaica Way'' (1959) and ''Carib Gold'' (1960). (Anancy, the famous trickster of African and Caribbean folklore, was a frequent subject for her.)         Also in 1943, she entered Friends' College, where she began to study Jamaican folklore seriously.         Ms. Bennett won a British Council Scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1945 and was the first black student there. After graduation she worked with British repertory companies. In 1945 and 1946 she was host of a BBC radio show, ''Caribbean Carnival.''         Returning to Jamaica in 1947, she found it hard to earn a living. In 1950 she went back to England, where she again found work with the BBC, as host of another Caribbean show, ''West Indian Night.''         Moving to New York in 1953, she worked at Macy's. She and Mr. Coverly directed a folk musical, ''Day in Jamaica,'' which began at St. Martin's Little Theater in Harlem and later moved around Episcopal church halls in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.         Ms. Bennett worked with Alma John, a well-known black broadcaster, and sang folk songs at the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village. Then, in May 1954, she married Mr. Coverly; they returned to Jamaica in 1955.         In 1956 she was appointed drama officer with the Jamaica Social Welfare Commission, then was its director from 1959 to 1963. Her work at the commission took her across Jamaica, putting her back in touch with her studies of its folklore and oral history.         She also taught drama and folklore at the University of the West Indies, and was on the staff of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation briefly in 1959, but resigned to pursue a freelance career.         Ms. Bennett was made a Member of the British Empire (M.B.E.) in 1960 for her work in Jamaican literature and theater.         Among her several books on poetry and folklore, ''Jamaica Labrish'' (1966) is perhaps her most famous. Her first publication was ''Dialect Verses'' (1942). She also recorded many albums, including ''Jamaica Folksongs'' (Folkways) in 1953 and ''Yes Me Dear'' (Island Records Jamaica) in 1981.         Ms. Bennett was perhaps the most popular radio personality in Jamaica in the 1950's and 60's, with shows like ''Laugh With Louise,'' ''Miss Lou's Views'' and ''The Lou and Ranny Show.'' In the 1970's Jamaican children adored ''Ring Ding,'' her Saturday morning children's television show.         In the 1970's a theater for children's productions was named for her; it was refurbished in 1987 to celebrate her 50th anniversary in the theater. In 1979 the Jamaica Information Service produced a film on her, ''The Hon. Miss Lou.''         Ms. Bennett and Mr. Coverly lived in Canada for several years. The Jamaican government had refused to grant duty concessions for costly drugs he needed, and they sold their home and possessions to make the move. She said at the time that Jamaica was wherever she was.         After she nursed him through years of ill health, her husband died at 91. Ms. Bennett is survived by her stepson, Fabian Coverly, and three step-grandsons.         She made a tearful and triumphant final visit to Jamaica in 2003 for a celebration organized by the former prime minister P. J. Patterson.       
         June Allyson, whose perky wholesomeness made her the perfect girlfriend in a series of MGM musicals during the 1940's and the perfect screen wife during the 1950's, died on Saturday at her home in Ojai, Calif. She was 88.         Her death was announced yesterday by her daughter, Pamela Allyson Powell. The cause was pulmonary respiratory failure and acute bronchitis, she told The Associated Press.         Cheerful, blonde and petite but with a husky voice, Miss Allyson turned from chorus girl into movie star when she melted into the arms of Van Johnson in ''Two Girls and a Sailor'' in 1944. For the next decade, Miss Allyson and Mr. Johnson were a romantic team, co-starring in ''High Barbaree'' (1947), ''The Bride Goes Wild'' (1948), ''Too Young to Kiss'' (1951), and ''Remains to Be Seen'' (1953).         She also starred twice opposite Robert Walker -- in ''Her Highness and the Bellboy'' (1945) and ''The Sailor Takes a Wife'' (1946) -- and played a bouncy Jo March in MGM's glossy 1949 remake of ''Little Women.''         By 1950, Miss Allyson had made the segue from adoring girlfriend to devoted wife. She was happy to leave musicals behind. Although she had started in the chorus on Broadway, she told an interviewer in 1951: ''I couldn't dance, and, Lord knows, I couldn't sing, but I got by somehow. Richard Rodgers was always keeping them from firing me.''         She was the steadfast wife of James Stewart's one-legged baseball player in ''The Stratton Story'' (1949); the widow left behind by Mr. Stewart's bandleader in ''The Glenn Miller Story'' (1953); the worried wife of Mr. Stewart's baseball player recalled to active duty in ''Strategic Air Command'' (1955); and the understanding wife who loses Alan Ladd's jet pilot to honor and duty in ''The McConnell Story ( 1955).         In ''Executive Suite'' (1954), she assured her husband, played by William Holden, who was vying for president of the Tredway Corporation, ''Darling, if it's something you really want, that's all that's important to either of us.''         Ms. Allyson was always modest about her star power. ''Women identify with me,'' she said in a 1986 intervew, ''and while men desire Cyd Charisse, they'd take me home to meet Mom.''         When Miss Allyson tried to move beyond Peter Pan collars and sugary characters as the harsh and nasty woman who pushes her husband (José Ferrer) into a nervous breakdown in ''The Shrike'' (1955), her acting was praised but audiences refused to accept her, and the movie was a box-office failure.         June Allyson was born Ella Geisman on Oct. 7, 1917, in the Bronx. Her alcoholic father skipped out when she was 6 months old. When she was 8, she was crushed by a falling tree limb while riding a bicycle. After four years in a back brace, she taught herself to dance by watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies.         The expensive therapy the injuries required tumbled the Geisman family out of genteel poverty into desperation. In her 1982 autobiography, ''June Allyson,'' written with Frances Spatz Leighton, Miss Allyson said she and her mother were forced to move countless times. The best months were when her mother had a job in a restaurant, she wrote, ''because sometimes she could bring home food.''         Recovering from her injuries, she tried out for and won a chorus job in a 1938 Broadway revue, ''Sing Out the News,'' taking the name June (for the month) Allyson. Between 1938 and 1941, Miss Allyson sang and danced in several Broadway shows, including ''Very Warm for May,'' ''Higher and Higher'' and ''Panama Hattie.'' As understudy to Betty Hutton, who played the comedy lead in ''Panama Hattie,'' Miss Allyson took over the part for five performances when Miss Hutton came down with measles. In a plot development worthy of an MGM musical, the producer George Abbott saw her performance and offered her a small featured role in his next musical, ''Best Foot Forward.'' MGM bought the movie rights to the musical, and Miss Allyson was invited to Hollywood to play her role on screen. She stayed at MGM for 11 years and 25 movies.         ''The only parental authority I had was the studio,'' Miss Allyson said in 1972. ''When I was a star, there was always somebody with me, to guard me. I was not allowed to be photographed with a cigarette, a drink, a cup of coffee or even a glass of water because someone might think it was liquor. When I left the studio I was already married and had two children, but I felt as sad as a child leaving home for the first time.''         A second-tier star at a studio that prided itself on owning ''more stars than there are in heaven,'' Miss Allyson defied the studio boss Louis B. Mayer in only one thing. She fell in love with the married movie star Dick Powell. Mr. Powell divorced his wife, the actress Joan Blondell, and married Miss Allyson in 1945, despite Mr. Mayer's opposition. Although the marriage was rocky at times -- Miss Allyson once filed for divorce -- it lasted until Mr. Powell's death from cancer in 1963 at age 58. In her autobiography she touched on her struggle with alcoholism after Mr. Powell's death.         Miss Allyson and Mr. Powell co-starred in two mediocre movies in 1950, ''The Reformer and the Redhead'' and ''Right Cross.'' Miss Allyson recalled being told that because of her childhood accident, she would never be able to have children, so she and Mr. Powell adopted a baby girl, Pamela, in 1948. Two years later, she gave birth to a son, Richard.         Pamela Allyson Powell now lives in Santa Monica, Calif. Richard, of Los Angeles, also survives Miss Allyson, as does her husband, David Ashrow, a dentist whom she married in 1976. A previous marriage, to Mr. Powell's hairdresser, Glenn Maxwell, in 1963, the year Mr. Powell died, ended in divorce.         Miss Allyson's film career had petered out in the late 1950's with a remake of ''My Man Godfrey '' (1957) opposite David Niven, and a sudsy Ross Hunter melodrama ''A Stranger in My Arms'' (1959). From 1959 to 1961, she was host of and occasionally starred in ''The DuPont Show With June Allyson,'' a dramatic anthology on CBS. After replacing Julie Harris as the star of ''40 Carats'' on Broadway and touring for a year in a revival of ''No, No Nanette,'' she returned to the screen and to MGM in 1972 as a lesbian murderess in ''They Only Kill Their Masters.'' She also appeared on ''Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and other television shows.         In 1985 she became the national spokeswoman for Depend, a diaper for adults with incontinence. Still wearing her trademark pageboy hairdo, she broke one of the last taboos by bringing this uncomfortable subject into the nation's living rooms by way of television commercials.         Writing about Miss Allyson's autobiography in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: ''Miss Allyson presents herself as the same sunny, tomboyish figure she played on screen. Even the tough parts of her life -- the death of her husband Dick Powell and her subsequent bout with alcoholism -- are described in a relatively blithe manner.'' Ms. Maslin added that Miss Allyson sounded ''like someone who has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen.''       
         Cora T. Walker, a prominent New York lawyer who nearly 60 years ago became one of the first black women to practice law in the state, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, said her son Lawrence R. Bailey Jr., a lawyer, who practiced with his mother for many years.         For decades, Ms. Walker ran a private practice in Harlem, first on 125th Street and later from a restored brownstone at 270 Lenox Avenue. From 1976 until her retirement in 1999, she was the senior partner in Walker & Bailey, one of the city's few black law firms, which she established with her son.         The firm's practice eventually included corporate clients like Conrail, the Ford Motor Company, Texas Instruments and Kentucky Fried Chicken. But Ms. Walker continued drawing up wills and preparing personal-injury claims for the men and women she described as the ''plain, ordinary, not elegant people'' of her Harlem community.         Active in Republican politics, Ms. Walker ran unsuccessfully for the New York State Senate in 1958 and 1964. In 1970, The New York Times included her -- the only woman -- on a list of the most powerful leaders in Harlem.         Cora Thomasina Walker was born on June 20, 1922, in Charlotte, N.C., one of nine children of William and Benetta Jones Walker. The family moved to the Bronx when she was a child. When she was an adolescent, her parents separated, leaving her, her mother and her siblings dependent on public assistance.         After graduating from James Monroe High School in the Bronx, Ms. Walker promptly informed the Welfare Department that their help was no longer required: she would support the family. She took a night job as a teletype operator with Western Union and also sold Christmas cards.         At the same time, Ms. Walker was enrolled at St. John's University, then in Brooklyn, in a special six-year program in which students earned both a bachelor's degree and a law degree. She received a bachelor's degree in accounting from St. John's in 1945 and a law degree the next year.         For much of her career, Ms. Walker was active in the National Bar Association, a historically black organization. She helped found the association's Corporate Counsel Conference, an annual meeting sponsored by its commercial law section. Begun in 1988, the conference helps black lawyers cultivate relationships with corporate clients.         In the 1960's, Ms. Walker became the first woman to serve as president of the Harlem Lawyers Association.         Ms. Walker's marriage, to Lawrence R. Bailey Sr., a lawyer, ended in divorce. In addition to her son Lawrence Jr., of the Bronx, she is survived by another son, Bruce E. Bailey, a physician, of Norwich, Conn.; a sister, Danetta Black, formerly of White Plains; and three grandchildren.         In 1947, when Ms. Walker was admitted to the New York bar, she found the doors of the city's law firms tightly shut. (One firm relented and offered her a position -- as a secretary.) So she struck out on her own.         Her first client was an undertaker, for whom she did collections. Before long, by dint of reading self-improvement books, Ms. Walker had learned to ''join everything, give everybody a card, join a political club,'' as she told The New York Times in 1989.         In 1999, the New York County Lawyers' Association installed a plaque outside the Lenox Avenue brownstone where Ms. Walker had her office, commemorating her half-century in the law. The building has since been sold, her son said, and the plaque is now gone.       
         Martha E. Peterson, the president of Barnard College in the turbulent Vietnam War era who went on hold the same position at Beloit College, died last Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 90.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said Ron Nief, a spokesman for Beloit, in Wisconsin.         Miss Peterson, as she preferred to be called, was known for fostering calm at Barnard's campus in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan during the late 1960's and early 70's, when student demonstrations roiled at the neighboring campus of Columbia University.         Miss Peterson, who was president of Barnard from 1967 to 1975, said shortly after her appointment: ''I'm not alarmed by student demonstrations. We better try to build bridges of understanding.''         At Beloit, where she was president from 1975 to 1981, Miss Peterson was credited with restoring fiscal stability when enrollment and the endowment were shrinking.         Martha Elizabeth Peterson was born on June 22, 1916, outside Jamestown, Kan., the only child of a wheat farmer and a news reporter. She graduated from the University of Kansas in 1937.         After teaching high school mathematics for several years, she returned to the University of Kansas and earned a master's degree in educational psychology in 1943.         Three years later, after teaching mathematics at the university, Miss Peterson was named assistant dean of women. In 1952, she was promoted to dean of women, and five years later was appointed to a similar post at the University of Wisconsin. In 1959, Miss Peterson completed her doctorate in educational psychology at Kansas.         In May 1967, Miss Peterson was chosen the seventh president of Barnard.         Dorothy Urman Denburg, the current dean of Barnard, was a student government officer during the antiwar protests, during which more than 100 Barnard students were arrested.         ''The campus came to a grinding halt,'' Dean Denburg recalled. ''Martha convened the entire college community -- faculty and students -- in one of the largest rooms on campus to talk about what the college's response should be. The outcome was a series of compromises giving students options for completing their academic work.''         In Miss Peterson's estimation, she once told a reporter, her most significant achievement was working out an arrangement between Barnard and Columbia that allowed students at both colleges to take an unlimited number of courses at the other school while retaining Barnard's autonomy.         Desiring to return to her Midwest roots, she took the job of president of Beloit. She helped improve the school's economic situation by selling off parts of the campus and cutting the staff.         Beloit's current president, John E. Burris, said that Miss Peterson's ''down-to-earth style, mixed with congenial good humor, worked well for Beloit at a time when severe personnel and fiscal decisions were necessary.''         Miss Peterson is survived by her companion, Dr. Maxine Bennett.       
         Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German-born soprano whose interpretations of Strauss and Mozart made her one of the most dazzling artists of her time, died yesterday at her home in Austria. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Austrian state television. Citing a funeral home director, the broadcaster, ORF, said Miss Schwarzkopf had died in the town of Schruns in Austria's westernmost province, Vorarlberg. No cause of death was given.         To her legions of admirers, Miss Schwarzkopf was a peerless interpreter of Strauss's Marschallin, Mozart's Donna Elvira and other operatic roles. But her image was tarnished in her later years by revelations that she had lied about the extent of her association with the Nazis during World War II.         Not only had she performed for the Nazis, it was learned, but she had also been a member of the party. In her defense, she said that for an artist needing work, joining the party had been ''akin to joining a union.''         For a singer of such unquestionable stature, Miss Schwarzkopf's work was controversial. In her prime, she possessed a radiant lyric soprano voice, impressive technical agility and exceptional understanding of style. From the 1950's until the 1970's, she was for many listeners the high priestess of the lieder recital, a sublime artist who brought textual nuance, interpretive subtlety and elegant musicianship to her work.         But others found her interpretations calculated, mannered and arch (the ''Prussian perfectionist,'' one critic called her), and complained that in trying to add textual vitality, Miss Schwarzkopf resorted to crooning and half-spoken dramatic effects.         Connoisseurs and critics could be surprisingly divided about her basic vocal gifts.         Will Crutchfield, reviewing some live recordings of Miss Schwarzkopf in recital, wrote in The New York Times in 1990: ''It was always clear that she had a superior voice (a smooth, glamorous lyric soprano) and superior technical command.'' Yet Peter G. Davis, writing in The Times in 1981, described her career as ''a triumph of intelligence and willpower over what was basically an unremarkable voice.''         The consensus, however, was that in roles like the Marschallin and other Strauss heroines (Ariadne in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' the countess in ''Capriccio''), as well as Mozart's Fiordiligi and Countess Almaviva and Wagner's Eva and Elsa, she could sing incomparably, with shimmering tone and richness and charismatic presence.         She was an uncommonly beautiful woman, despite a visible gap between her two front teeth that she never bothered to correct, with light hair and deep-set gray eyes. For a time in her younger years she pursued a career as a film actress and might have succeeded had she continued.         A hard-working, self-challenging singer, she performed 74 roles in 53 operas, including Anne Trulove in the world premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress'' in Venice in 1951. Her lieder repertory included hundreds of songs by Schubert, Schumann, Mozart and Strauss, and she was a pioneering champion of the songs of Hugo Wolf, which she sang with insight and affecting beauty.         Olga Maria Elisabeth Frederike Schwarzkopf was born on Dec. 9, 1915, in Jarotschin, Germany, in what is now west-central Poland. Both her parents were Prussian. Friedrich Schwarzkopf, her father, a classics schoolmaster, was an easygoing intellectual. Her mother, the former Elisabeth Frohling, was an efficient homemaker who took charge of her adored only child's education and budding musical career.         Friedrich Schwarzkopf's work as a teacher necessitated that the family move several times. When Elisabeth was 13, they settled in Magdeburg, Germany, where she studied piano, guitar, viola and organ and developed a naturally high, light voice that kept her in demand for concerts at school and local amateur performances.         The family moved to Berlin in 1933, the year Hitler came to power. Miss Schwarzkopf attended the Berlin Royal Augusta School and later won admission to the Hochschule für Musik. In 1934, before beginning her formal training, she won a grant from the League of National Socialist Students for a cycling and camping trip to England, where she learned English. She retained a fondness for the country, which after the war embraced her as an artist and made her a Dame of the British Empire in 1992.         At the music school, students were required to attend daily lectures on Hitler's National Socialist movement, and in 1935, when she was nearly 20, Miss Schwarzkopf joined the student association of the National Socialist Party. Alan Jefferson, a Schwarzkopf biographer, said she became führerin of the student organization and that one of her responsibilities as ideological leader was to ''keep an eye on other students.''         Her teacher at the Hochschule für Musik, Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, though distinguished in her field, inexplicably believed that Miss Schwarzkopf should be a contralto. It was not until after her formal training, in 1938, when she began singing with the Berlin State Opera, that Miss Schwarzkopf came into her own vocally.         During this time she gained a reputation as a singer fiercely determined to leap from the small roles typically assigned a newcomer into substantive parts. The director of the company, Wilhelm Rode, had won the favor of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One reason Miss Schwarzkopf later gave for cooperating with the Nazis was that it was incumbent on aspiring singers in the company to support the party.         But until the 1980's, she maintained that she had never officially joined the Nazi Party. She denied having done so in three Allied questionnaires in 1945, a time during the occupation when former party members were usually barred from public performance in Germany.         In 1982, however, a music historian at the University of Vienna, Oliver Rathkolb, published a doctoral dissertation that revealed details of her party membership. The information had come from documents discovered in the Allied Denazification Bureau in Vienna and subsequently moved to the National Archives in Washington.         According to these records, Miss Schwarzkopf applied for membership on Jan. 26, 1940, and was accepted on March 1 of that year, becoming Nazi member No. 7548960. Scholars and authors have since placed her application for party membership even earlier.         In an interview with The Times in 1983, Miss Schwarzkopf denied she had been a party member. But when told of these documents by The Times, she admitted that she had joined the party. ''We thought nothing of it,'' she said. ''We just did it.'' In a letter to The Times, she expanded on her explanation: ''It was akin to joining a union, and exactly for the same reason: to have a job.''         In other interviews, she quoted in her defense the first line of Tosca's famous aria: ''Vissi d'arte,'' which translates, ''I lived for art.''         Discussion of her Nazi past re-emerged briefly in connection with tributes to her on her 80th birthday. Mr. Jefferson's biography, ''Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,'' which came out at the time, raised debate about her wartime role, depicting her as an ambitious singer who was focused on furthering her career.         As a Nazi, Miss Schwarzkopf gave performances at party functions and sang for Waffen SS troops at the front. Some researchers believe she became a member of Goebbels's Reichstheaterkammer, working in the propaganda ministry and appearing insome films.         Still, if she had hoped that party affiliation would quickly advance her career at the Berlin State Opera, it did not work as planned. She was still expected to sing, sometimes nightly, bit roles in ''Carmen,'' ''Die Fledermaus'' and frothy operettas.         Her breakthrough came with the dauntingly difficult coloratura role of Zerbinetta in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' which she first sang in late 1940. Her performance won the attention of Maria Ivogün, a noted exponent of the role. Miss Ivogün was so impressed, she took on Miss Schwarzkopf as a private student, coaching her in the high soprano repertory, and training her as a lieder singer. Miss Schwarzkopf was soon engaged by the Vienna State Opera.         She realized that her future lay with the lyric soprano repertory. Engagements followed at the first postwar Salzburg Festival in 1947, where she worked with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and in subsequent summers, when she formed a close working relationship with the conductor Herbert von Karajan. She also toured with the Vienna State Opera in 1947, traveling to London, where she performed in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Fidelio'' at Covent Garden.         The London performances were an enormous success, and she was invited to join the newly founded Covent Garden company. She sang with the company for the next five years, performing not just her German repertory but also Violetta, Mimi, Gilda, and Massenet's Manon, all in English.         Her career and repertory choices were now being shaped by Walter Legge, then a music administrator and critic. Born in London in 1906, Legge had no formal training in music but was musically astute. He had been an assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham and was largely responsible for forming the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus.         After the war, Legge worked mainly for recording companies. It was during a scouting trip to Vienna in search of new talent for EMI Records that the severe-looking, bespectacled Legge first heard Miss Schwarzkopf in an audition. Thus began an artistic partnership that grew into a life partnership. Legge, then divorced from his first wife, Nancy Evans, a mezzo-soprano, married Miss Schwarzkopf in 1953.         Opinion is divided about the effect Legge had on Miss Schwarzkopf as an artist. He tended to treat her as a musical and intellectual inferior. He was capable of berating her in public when she failed to meet his approval.         But he introduced her to a wealth of repertory, especially the songs of Hugo Wolf, and as artistic director of EMI Records, he supervised her recordings, coaching her in detail and ensuring that the engineers captured her voice at its best. Given Miss Schwarzkopf's association with the Nazis, there was some trepidation about launching her American career. Her debut in the United States was delayed until October 1953, but that performance, a single sold-out song recital at Town Hall in New York, captivated the critics.         This was followed in late 1954 by an American tour, which ended back at Town Hall. A critic for Musical America wrote that Miss Schwarzkopf's singing at Town Hall had ''displayed the exquisite finish, technical mastery and interpretive felicity that had marked her debut recital here last season.''         In the fall of 1956 she sang a recital at Carnegie Hall. It was the first time the hall had ever been sold out for a program of German lieder.         Miss Schwarzkopf's American operatic debut came in 1955 with the San Francisco Opera as the Marschallin. Mildred Norton, a critic for The Saturday Review, reported that a capacity audience had saluted a ''memorable new Princess Werdenberg.'' Miss Schwarzkopf, she wrote, was ''a poised and vibrant new personality with a vocal radiance and a personal grace.''         Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera did not occur until October 1964, again as the Marschallin. Though Raymond Erickson, a critic for The Times, noted less freshness and bloom in Miss Schwarzkopf's voice (she was nearly 49), he said she had ''conquered her listeners, and the roar that filled the house when she took her bows must be the kind that the most vain prima donna could ask for.''         Outside the Metropolitan Opera House, there were scattered protests over her wartime career, and Miss Schwarzkopf had a chilly relationship with the Met's general manager Rudolf Bing, an Austrian-born Jew. Besides her six performances of the Marschallin that debut season, she sang only one more time at the Met, a Donna Elvira in 1966.         But she performed frequently in New York in recital and with orchestras and continued to win devoted admirers around the world. Many of her EMI recordings became immediate classics. Among them were her Mozart song album with the pianist Walter Gieseking and her Schubert song album with the pianist Edwin Fischer, both recorded in 1952; her 1957 recording of ''Rosenkavalier,'' conducted by Karajan, and, one of her finest achievements, her 1959 recording of ''Capriccio,'' conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.         As her career slowed, she began giving master classes, usually teaming with Legge, gaining a reputation as an insightful but almost impossibly exacting coach. In 1977-78, she embarked on a swan song recital tour, mostly accompanied by the pianist Geoffrey Parsons, who was her partner for her official farewell recital in Zurich on March 19, 1979. Two days later, Legge, who had become embittered that his talents were no longer sought by recording companies, died of a heart attack at 72.         Miss Schwarzkopf leaves no immediate survivors. Asked once whether she regretted having had no children, she replied, ''I have 500 children, the songs I sing.''         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A photograph with an obituary yesterday about the renowned soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who died Thursday in Austria at age 90, was published in error. The picture, supplied by the Salzburg Festival, showed Anneliese Rothenberger, not Miss Schwarzkopf, in the role of Sophie from a 1962 film adaptation of Richard Strauss's opera ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' Miss Schwarzkopf played the Marschallin in that production, which the festival had staged for the film. The Marschallin was a signature role for Miss Schwarzkopf, who performed it, above, in 1959 at Covent Garden in London.         (Photo by Evening Standard/Getty Images)         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was published in error. It showed Anneliese Rothenberger -- not Miss Schwarzkopf -- in the role of Sophie from ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' a 1962 film adaptation of the Richard Strauss opera. The Salzburg Festival mounted that production, in which Miss Schwarzkopf had the role of the Marschallin, and originally distributed the photograph with the incorrect information. A picture of Miss Schwarzkopf appears today on Page C10.         The obituary also misspelled the surname of a music critic for The New York Times who reviewed Miss Schwarzkopf's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1964. He was Raymond Ericson, not Erickson.         Correction:  August 10, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Friday of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf referred incorrectly to her birthplace in some copies. When she was born in 1915, the town was Jarotschin, Germany, not Jarocin, and it was not ''near Poland;'' Poland did not exist then as an independent nation. Since 1918 the town has been Jarocin, Poland.       
         Marion Cajori, an independent filmmaker who chronicled the creative process in documentaries about artists, died on Aug. 8 in Manhattan. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan and Setauket, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said Nicholas Quennell, a member of the board of the Art Kaleidoscope Foundation, which produced her films.         Over her career, Ms. Cajori worked as a director, producer and writer. She came by her interest in artists naturally, as the child of two New York painters, Charles Cajori and Anne Child. Her parents separated when she was young, and she grew up in art circles in New York and Paris.         Ms. Cajori studied painting and filmmaking at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, earning a B.F.A. in 1974. She was a member of the feminist editorial collective Heresies in the early 1970's.         Her first film, ''Sept. 11, 1972,'' was a Minimalist portrait of sunlight in her studio, made with the conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth. She also collaborated with the video artist Joan Jonas and the director Lizzie Borden. ''White Lies,'' her narrative short-form film of 1981, gave Willem Dafoe one of his first cinematic roles.         In 1990 she established the Art Kaleidoscope Foundation, which was co-producer, with the independent filmmaker Christian Blackwood, of her first widely known film, the award-winning 1992 documentary ''Joan Mitchell: Portrait of an Abstract Painter.'' The film presented an unusually intimate view of this famously private, intractable painter, whom Ms. Cajori first met when she was 9.         In 1998, PBS broadcast Ms. Cajori's Emmy-nominated special, ''Chuck Close: A Portrait in Progress.'' She recently completed a second full-length feature about Mr. Close and the artists and curators whose portraits he paints, which is to be released this year.         Since 1992, she had been working on a feature-length film about the sculptor Louise Bourgeois with the art critic Amei Wallach. A segment of ''Louise Bourgeois: Art Is Sanity'' was shown on ''Art: 21'' on PBS in 2002. Ms. Wallach said she expected to complete the film by the end of 2007.         Ms. Cajori was married to Paul Jay, but had been separated from him for many years.         She is survived by her father; her brother, Lukas Weber of Portland, Me.; and her daughter, Isabel Jay, and her son, Florian Jay, both of New York.       
         Andrée Ruellan, a noted painter of the 1930's and 40's whose complete body of work spans almost the entire 20th century, died on July 15 in Kingston, N.Y. She was 101 and lived for many years in Shady, N.Y., near Woodstock.         Her death was confirmed by a friend, Daniel Gelfand. Ms. Ruellan leaves no immediate survivors.         A child prodigy, Ms. Ruellan first exhibited her work at 9. As a young woman, she was known for her sympathetic depictions of scenes from ordinary life, which she observed on the streets of New York and in her travels in the American South.         Reviewing an exhibition of Ms. Ruellan's work in 1940, The New York Times called it ''light, fresh and largely in the true field of American genre,'' adding, ''it is never without strength and clarity.''         Last year, in honor of Ms. Ruellan's 100th birthday, a retrospective of her work was organized by the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, Ga. It is currently on view, through Aug. 27, at the Columbus Museum in Columbus, Ga.         Ms. Ruellan's work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art and elsewhere.         Andrée Ruellan (pronounced roo-ELL-en) was born in Manhattan on April 6, 1905, to parents who had come from France. Her father, André, was an aviator and airplane mechanic.         Ms. Ruellan began drawing early. In 1914, when she was 9, the Ashcan School painter Robert Henri invited her to join a group show in the East Village; she contributed watercolors and drawings of urban street life. That year she also had an illustration published in The Masses, a progressive magazine.         In 1920 Ms. Ruellan's father was killed in an airfield accident, and she began selling her work to support herself and her mother, Lucette. The same year she was awarded a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York, where she studied with the noted painter Maurice Sterne.         For much of the 1920's, she and her mother lived in Paris. There she met John W. Taylor, a painter, whom she married in 1929. Soon afterward, the couple moved to Shady, where they were for decades part of Woodstock's lively artists' colony. Mr. Taylor died in 1983.         During the Depression Ms. Ruellan and her husband made several trips to the South, which resulted in some of her most memorable work. Her paintings from the period are notable for their portrayals of ordinary African-Americans at work and at play.         ''Crap Game'' (1936), perhaps Ms. Ruellan's best-known painting, depicts a group of black men in Charleston, S.C., engaged in an avid game of dice. But the muted palette and the stark emptiness of the background convey the straitened circumstances of black life in the Depression-era South.         In later years Ms. Ruellan's work was more influenced by Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. But to the end of her career -- she continued to draw until she was well into her 80's -- she remained a Realist, committed to the idea that art should represent solid, flesh-and-blood humanity.         ''People are never just spots of color,'' Ms. Ruellan told American Artist magazine in 1943. ''What moves me most is that in spite of poverty and the constant struggle for existence, so much kindness and sturdy courage remain. Naturally I want to paint well-designed pictures -- but I also wish to convey these warmer human emotions.''       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         The cause was complications of esophageal cancer, a family spokeswoman, Cathy Bonner, said. Ms. Bonner said the illness was diagnosed in March.         A champion of civil rights for minorities, women and gay men and lesbians, Ms. Richards first ran for governor in 1990 calling for a ''New Texas'' that would offer more opportunity and power to those groups.         She went on to become one of the most effective in a long line of Texas progressives who vied for control of the state when it was largely a Democratic stronghold. But her defeat after one term was a strong signal that generations of Democratic dominance in Texas had ended.         If one Mr. Bush closed out her political career, another figured into her rise, as a target of her barbs. ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her saucy, plain-spoken keynote address, borrowing from the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory, was one of the year's political highlights. ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said at one point.         The speech transformed her, then the Texas treasurer, into a national figure. And it made her, a mother of four, an admired champion of feminism. ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,'' she told the national audience. ''She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         Her defeat in 1994, coming in a year of sweeping Republican success at the polls nationwide, did not dim her celebrity on the national stage. She continued to speak out on behalf of liberal causes, was a regular commentator on CNN and appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips.         She also went to work as a senior adviser for the international law firm of Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper) and later for the public relations company Public Strategies. She also served on numerous boards of directors, including those of J. C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, an only child, in Lakeview, Tex. She graduated in 1950 from Waco High School, where she showed a special facility for debate and met her future husband, David Richards. In her junior year, she attended the Girls State mock government program in Austin and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girls Nation in Washington.         Ms. Richards went on to enroll at Baylor University in Waco on a debate scholarship and married. After graduating, she and Mr. Richards moved to Austin, where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School. She reared her four children -- Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen -- in Austin, and they were with her at home when she died, Ms. Bonner said.         Ms. Richards is also survived by eight grandchildren. Cecile Richards, who became president of Planned Parenthood this year, lives in New York; the other siblings live in Austin.         As a young woman, Ann Richards volunteered in several campaigns for governor: in 1958 for Henry B. Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough. She then helped Mr. Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In the early 1960's, she and a handful of other young Democrats founded North Dallas Democratic Women in an effort to give more power to women in the party. ''The regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who looked on women as little more than machine parts,'' she said later.         In 1972, she ran her first campaign, helping elect to the Texas Legislature Sarah Weddington, who had successfully argued Roe v. Wade before the United States Supreme Court.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin. She held the job for four years. She also began drinking heavily, becoming alcoholic and putting great strain on her marriage, she said later. The marriage ended in divorce.         After entering rehabilitation, she stopped drinking in 1980 and later said that the decision to seek help had saved her life and salvaged her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer and received the most votes of any statewide candidate, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years. She was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when Gov. William P. Clements Jr., the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, decided not to run for re-election, Ms. Richards challenged a former governor, Mark White, in the Democratic primary and won. She went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, in the general election after a brutal campaign.         As governor, among other achievements, she fulfilled her campaign promise to bring more blacks, Hispanics and women into public office. She appointed the first black regent to the University of Texas and installed the first blacks and women on the state's legendary police force, the Texas Rangers. She also pushed for tougher penalties for polluters and gained control of the state's insurance board in a drive to reduce the industry's influence over state government.         Ms. Richards oversaw an expansion of the state's prison system, increasing the space for prisoners by a third, and cracked down on the number of prisoners being paroled. She also instituted a major substance abuse program for prisoners and championed creation of the Texas lottery as a source of public school financing. She bought the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         The same year, she was named chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, which nominated Bill Clinton for president for the first time.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, George W. Bush, going so far as to refer to him as ''some jerk.'' The comment drew considerable criticism. She later acknowledged that Mr. Bush had been more effective than she at ''staying on message'' and that he had made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten 53 percent to 46 percent.         Ms. Richards was a co-author of several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' (Simon & Schuster, 1989), with Peter Knobler, and ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis'' (Dutton, 2003), with Richard U. Levine, a doctor.         On her 60th birthday, she got a motorcycle license, an event that was commemorated in a cover photo in Texas Monthly showing Ms. Richards's head superimposed on the body of a woman in a fringed jacket atop a Harley-Davidson beneath the headline ''White Hot Mama.''         In recent years, Ms. Richards had worked to establish the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, a public college preparatory school in Austin. It will open next year, giving priority to economically disadvantaged students. She was also a sought-after commentator and speaker whose observations had lost little of their tart humor since her national emergence two decades ago.         As she once explained, ''I learned early on that people liked you if you made them laugh.''         Correction:  September 16, 2006, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of Ann W. Richards, the former Texas governor, misstated the year she gave the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was 1988, not 1998.       
         Oriana Fallaci, a dissecting interviewer of the powerful and an iconoclastic journalist who became an icon herself, died Friday in her home city of Florence, Italy. She was 77.         Ms. Fallaci, who also had a home in Manhattan, was known to have suffered from cancer for the last decade. Paolo Klun, an official with the RCS publishing group, which carried Ms. Fallaci's work, told The Associated Press that Ms. Fallaci had gone back to Florence days ago as her condition worsened and that she had died at a private hospital there.         Known in recent years for writing angrily against Islam, Ms. Fallaci became famous in the 1960's and 70's for her war journalism and her long, aggressive and revealing interviews with prominent people. She was once described in The Los Angeles Times as ''the journalist to whom virtually no world figure would say no.'' Among her subjects were Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of the Iranian revolution; Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader; Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister; Indira Gandhi, the longstanding Indian prime minister; Nguyen Van Thieu, the South Vietnamese president during the war years; and Henry Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon's secretary of state.         Mr. Kissinger called his experience with Ms. Fallaci ''the most disastrous conversation I ever had with any member of the press.'' At the height of his power and celebrity in 1972, she had coaxed him to admit that at times he felt like ''the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse, the cowboy who rides all alone into the town.'' Mr. Kissinger later wrote in his memoirs that the quotation harmed his relations with Nixon.         A glamorous figure with high cheekbones, a black curl of eyeliner and an ever-present cigarette, she believed that she had the right to ask or say anything, and did so in writings translated into more than 20 languages. In interviews she could be in turn incisive, flattering and blunt, taking her subjects by surprise.         ''How do you swim in a chador?'' she asked Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, not long after he came to power in Iran. His reply, she wrote in The New York Times, was that she was not obliged to wear one, because it was a garment for proper Islamic women. She tore off her chador, and Ayatollah Khomeini stalked off.         Her boldness earned her a new generation of admirers -- and many detractors -- after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, prompted her to end years of silence with warnings about Islam. In three books beginning with ''The Rage and the Pride'' (Rizzoli, 2002) and in many interviews, she sharply criticized not only Islamic extremists but also Islam itself. She accused the West of having become too complacent and tolerant to understand the threat she believed Islam presented.         The ''sons of Allah breed like rats,'' she wrote, condemning the growing immigration of Muslims in Europe, including her homeland.         ''Europe is no longer Europe,'' she told The Wall Street Journal in 2005. ''It is 'Eurabia,' a colony of Islam, where the Islamic invasion does not proceed only in a physical sense, but also in a mental and cultural sense. Servility to the invaders has poisoned democracy, with obvious consequences for the freedom of thought, and for the concept itself of liberty.''         Her warnings endeared her to many conservatives and won her, a lifelong atheist, an audience with Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. But she was also accused of racism, and in Switzerland and Italy she was charged with violating laws against vilifying religion. In 2003, the left-wing Italian newspaper La Repubblica called her an ''exhibitionist posing as the Joan of Arc of the West.''         Born June 29, 1929, in Florence, she was made a lookout for the Italian Resistance at the age of 10 by her antifascist father, Edoardo, a cabinet maker. The early brush with danger became a pattern.         As a journalist, she covered wars from Vietnam to Central Asia to South America. In Mexico City in 1968, days before the Summer Olympics were to begin there, she was shot three times, dragged down steps by the hair by soldiers and left for dead in clashes in which several hundred protesters were killed.         ''Alas, nothing reveals man the way war does,'' she told an interviewer in 2001. ''Nothing so accentuates in him the beauty and ugliness, the intelligence and foolishness, the brutishness and humanity, the courage and cowardice, the enigma.''         But it was her interviews that made her famous and her books staples on college campuses around the world. Never married, she fell in love with one of her subjects, the Greek poet and activist Alekos Panagoulis, who was convicted of trying to assassinate Greece's military ruler, George Papadapoulos, in 1967. Mr. Panagoulis was killed in 1976 in a car crash that Ms. Fallaci maintained was an assassination. Her novel ''A Man'' was a barely concealed story of his life.         Her other books included a collection of her interviews, ''Interview with History'' (1976); ''If the Sun Dies'' (1966), about the American space program; ''Letter to a Child Unborn'' (1976), a novel about a single woman's conversation with a child she aborted; and ''The Force of Reason'' (2006), on Islam, Europe and the angry reaction to her post-Sept. 11 book ''The Rage and the Pride.''         In recent years she was a private and solitary figure, working out of her townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and visiting Florence and a house she owns in Tuscany. She is survived by a sister, Paola, who was with her when she died, Italian news reports said.         For a woman who relentlessly prodded her interview subjects into self revelation, Ms. Fallaci said she did not like to talk about herself.         ''To speak of oneself means to lay bare one's own soul, expose it like a body to the sun,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To lay bare one's own soul is not at all like taking off one's brassiere on a crowded beach!''         Correction:  September 21, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Saturday about the iconoclastic Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci misstated the title of one of her books and its publication date, and described incorrectly an element of the plot. The English title of the book is "Letter to a Child Never Born," not "Letter to a Child Unborn." It was published in 1975, not 1976, and it is about a single woman's conversation with a child that she ultimately miscarried, not aborted.       
         Maureen Daly, a writer whose first novel, ''Seventeenth Summer,'' anticipated the young-adult genre by decades when it appeared in 1942 and has endured as a classic coming-of-age story, died on Monday in Palm Desert, Calif. She was 85 and made her home in Palm Desert.         The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, her sister, Sheila Daly White, said.         Written when Ms. Daly was a teenager and published while she was still in college, ''Seventeenth Summer'' told the story of Angie and Jack, two teenagers who fall in love during one enchanted summer in a Wisconsin lakeside town. Written in a straightforward, unpretentious style, the book is full of innocent pastimes -- boating on the lake, Cokes at the corner drugstore -- mingled with more grown-up pleasures like beer and cigarettes.         Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Edith H. Walton wrote:         ''By a kind of miracle, and perhaps because she is so close to an experience not easy to recapture, Miss Daly has made an utterly enchanting book out of this very fragile little story -- one which rings true and sweet and fresh and sound.''         Published originally by Dodd, Mead & Company and most recently in 2002 by Simon & Schuster, ''Seventeenth Summer'' has sold more than a million copies worldwide, according to the reference book Authors and Artists for Young Adults.         Though fiction about adolescents was nothing new in the 1940's -- among its eminent practitioners had been Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington and Louisa May Alcott -- the concept of novels specifically earmarked for adolescents would not exist until the late 1960's, ushered in by writers like Paul Zindel and S. E. Hinton.         Yet a quarter-century earlier, ''Seventeenth Summer'' anticipated many of these authors' concerns, as Teri Lesesne, a professor of library science at Sam Houston State University and a specialist in young-adult literature, explained in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''For '42, this is a pretty avant-garde young woman: she smokes, she drinks, she dates,'' Ms. Lesesne said. ''She thinks about more than a chaste kiss at the end of a date.''         Maureen Patricia Daly was born on March 15, 1921, in Castlecaulfield, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. She came to the United States with her family as a young child.         When Ms. Daly was 15, her short story ''Fifteen'' was published in Scholastic magazine. The next year she wrote another story, fittingly titled ''Sixteen,'' that was included in the O. Henry collection of 1938, which gathered together the best short stories of the previous year. Then, working in the basement of her parents' home in Fond du Lac, Wis., she began ''Seventeenth Summer.''         After earning undergraduate degrees in English and Latin from Rosary College in River Forest., Ill., Ms. Daly worked as a reporter and book critic for The Chicago Tribune. She was later on the staff of Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post.         Among her many other books are the young-adult novels ''Acts of Love'' (1986) and ''First a Dream'' (1990), both published by Scholastic, and ''Mention My Name in Mombasa: The Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad'' (Dodd, Mead, 1958), a travel memoir written with her husband, William P. McGivern, a well-known crime novelist.         Ms. Daly's husband died in 1982; her daughter, Megan McGivern Shaw, died the next year. Besides her sister, Ms. White, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Patrick McGivern, of Palm Desert, and two grandchildren.         In an interview quoted in the reference book Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, Ms. Daly recalled the special urgency -- akin to grasping quicksilver -- that gave rise to ''Seventeenth Summer.''         ''I was so wildly and vividly happy about love and life at a particular time in my existence,'' she said. ''I wanted to get all that fleeting excitement down on paper before it passed, or I forgot the true feelings.''         She added, ''It was not until the reviews came out (and the royalties came in) that I realized I had recorded universal emotions and joys -- and people would want to read about them year after year.''       
         Dr. Gail Greenberg Shapiro, a pediatric allergist who contributed to important studies of drug treatments for asthma and allergies and helped develop widely used standards for managing childhood asthma, died on Aug. 25 in Seattle. She was 59.         Dr. Shapiro died during cardiac surgery. Her death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, of which Dr. Shapiro was a past president.         Beginning in the 1970's, she combined research with a clinical practice in Seattle and participated in trials of antihistamines and other drugs intended to treat asthma, rhinitis, hives and eczema. She also investigated factors like exercise and indoor dust mites in producing reactions that can lead to asthma in children.         Dr. Gary S. Rachelefsky, an allergist in private practice in Los Angeles and, with Patricia Garrison, co-author of a book, ''Free Your Child From Asthma,'' said Dr. Shapiro had been instrumental in preparing fresh guidelines to test for asthma, which is sometimes confused with a chronic cough or bronchitis.         In the 1990's, Dr. Rachelefsky and Dr. Shapiro worked together to distribute the ''Pediatric Asthma Guide'' to physicians, nurses and school administrators, to help in diagnosing the disease before an acute attack might occur. The booklet remains in use.         Gail Ina Greenberg was born in Brooklyn. She received her undergraduate degree from Brown and a medical degree from Johns Hopkins, in 1970.         After training at the University of Washington, she went into private practice at the Northwest Asthma and Allergy Center in Seattle, where she became a senior partner and remained for her career. Dr. Shapiro was also a clinical professor of pediatrics at Washington.         She helped edit a medical textbook, ''Allergy, Asthma and Immunology from Infancy to Adulthood'' (1996).         Dr. Shapiro is survived by her husband of 39 years, Dr. Peter A. Shapiro, an orthodontist; a son, Evan, and a daughter, Jessica Mirsky; and a grandchild.       
         Julia Levien, a leading authority on the dances of Isadora Duncan and a teacher of her technique, died on Sunday at her home on Roosevelt Island. She was 94.         Her death was announced by Catherine Gallant, a dancer and choreographer who studied with her for many years.         Ms. Levien (pronounced Le-VINE) was taught by Anna Duncan, one of Isadora Duncan's six adopted daughters, making Ms. Levien a third-generation Duncan dancer. When Ms. Levien herself began offering lessons in Duncan's work to younger students, she not only had them learn Duncan's way of moving and her choreography but also wove together classroom exercises with a running commentary on the arts and social issues of Duncan's time and the major influences that helped to shape Duncan's philosophy of movement.         A small, no-nonsense woman, Ms. Levien spoke her mind as a teacher in upbeat ways and had boundless curiosity -- and opinions. She taught and lectured internationally and wrote many articles about Duncan, continuing to work until last year.         Her students included Annabelle Gamson, a solo dancer and choreographer known for her exhilarating performances of Duncan dances, and most Duncan dancers performing today in New York studied at one point with Ms. Levien.         She was also an energetic mediator in the often disorganized world of Duncan teachers and students, bringing factions together in the Duncan Dance Guild, which she organized in the 1950's. She created the Duncan Centenary Company in 1977 to celebrate Duncan's centenary, playing an important role in the rebirth of interest in Duncan's work.         Though she was not the only knowledgeable restager of the dances, Ms. Levien's reconstructions helped to prove that Duncan choreographed rather than improvised dances, and that they had structure, set steps, gestures and patterns, all informed by a philosophy of naturally flowing and gravity-bound movement. Ms. Levien's teaching made clear that Duncan's simple-looking moves demanded extreme focus and concentration to achieve not only the correct execution but also important and distinctive tones or emotional qualities.         ''We weren't allowed to change from left to right a pinky!'' said Ms. Levien in a 1978 interview in The New York Times, in which she recalled her training in and performance of Duncan dances.         Ms. Levien dined out on stories about Duncan she heard from childhood, including an account of Duncan's visit to a reception for writers at her family's home in the Bronx, which the dance star described as ''the charming little hideaway I've dreamed of.''         After training with Anna Duncan, Ms. Levien performed throughout the world in the 1930's and 40's with her company and that of Irma Duncan, another of Isadora Duncan's daughters. Ms. Levien also began to create her own choreography in the 1930's in dances that, like most modern dance of the time, reflected social concerns.         Ms. Levien danced the Duncan pieces ''in a totally different manner which is nonimitative, nontraditional and her own,'' John Martin wrote in a 1943 review in The Times. ''She moves with great beauty and an apparently innate sense of dynamics,'' he continued, describing her performance of her own choreography: ''Few dancers can manage to make sustained, lyrical movement so engrossing simply as movement.''         Ms. Levien married and settled in Queens, where she raised a family and taught Duncan dance to children. She wrote and illustrated ''Duncan Dance, A Guide for Young People,'' published by the Princeton Book Company in 1994.         She is survived by her son, Eliot Golden of Roslyn, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         As a child, Ms. Levien met Duncan.         ''I recall a diaphanous white figure moving magically in a vast blue space,'' she said in a speech at the 92nd Street Y in 1996. ''After the performance, when all of us children in the audience rushed to the apron of the stage, Isadora stood gesturing above us, asking the audience for donations for her Russian school. The money rained down. It was at that moment that I noticed her hennaed hair and streaked makeup. Still, to us she seemed like some extraordinary goddess.''       
         Isabel Bigley, who won a Tony award in 1951 playing Sarah Brown, the Salvation Army missionary who falls in love with a handsome gambler in the raucous Broadway hit ''Guys and Dolls,'' died Saturday in Los Angeles. She was 80, and lived in Los Angeles and Rancho Mirage, Calif.         The cause was pulmonary disease, her son Lawrence Barnett Jr. said.         With a powerful, wide-ranging voice, the raven-haired Miss Bigley belted out ''If I Were a Bell,'' when her character realized that she had fallen for Sky Masterson, one of the sinners she had come to save from the gaudy environs of gamblers, showgirls and cops on Broadway.         ''If I were a bell I would be ringing,'' Miss Bigley sang. ''If I were a lamp I'd light.''         The song was originally written for another character, but that performer had difficulty handling it. The composer, Frank Loesser, reworked it for the Sarah Brown character, and it became the signature song of Miss Bigley's career.         The show, based on a story by Damon Runyon, had a long and triumphant run, produced many hits that have become standard songs, and is frequently revived. Miss Bigley stayed with the original production for three years.         Miss Bigley, who also played leading roles in ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Me and Juliet,'' was a frequent performer on television in its early days, appearing on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''The Colgate Comedy Hour.'' On June 25, 1951, she -- along with other entertainers like Arthur Godfrey, Garry Moore and Faye Emerson -- appeared on an hourlong CBS program that was the start of nationally broadcast color television.         In 1958, Miss Bigley retired to raise her family.         Isabel Bigley Barnett was born in the Bronx on Feb. 23, 1926, the only child of Joseph and Isabel Press Bigley. Besides her son Lawrence, of Los Angeles, Miss Bigley is survived by her husband of 53 years, Lawrence R. Barnett, whom she met when he was president of the Music Corporation of America, a major talent agency; three other sons, Robert, of Denver, William, of Los Angeles and James, of Atherton, Calif.; two daughters, Claudia Scott of Concord, N.H., and Laurey Treiger of Los Angeles; 16 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.         ''Ever since I was 12 years old I've been studying for a career in theater,'' Miss Bigley wrote in a first-person article for The World Telegram in 1952, shortly before the end of her run in ''Guys and Dolls.'' She took voice lessons at Walton High School in the Bronx and then during the summer at Juilliard. She also learned stenography and began working at a Wall Street law firm.         One day, Miss Bigley asked for an extended lunch hour and took a 20-minute subway ride to an audition for the chorus in ''Oklahoma!'' To her surprise, she was signed as the understudy for the lead role of the farm girl Laurey.         ''I left a pile of unanswered letters on the desk,'' she wrote.         Soon after, the producers sent Miss Bigley to London to take over as Laurey in the Drury Lane production of ''Oklahoma.'' She played that role there for three years, then came back to the United States for screen tests in Hollywood, which did not go too well.         After returning to New York, she auditioned for ''Guys and Dolls'' and was cast as Sarah Brown, her first leading role on Broadway. The production ''has the most flamboyant population of any show in town,'' The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, and Miss Bigley ''plays a few enticing tricks on one of Mr. Loesser's most rollicking songs.''         In 1953, Miss Bigley played Jeanie in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Me and Juliet'' -- a Valentine to show business that chronicle's the backstage life of a successful Broadway musical.         ''It would be hard to collect a more attractive cast,'' Mr. Atkinson wrote of that show, ''than one that includes Isabel Bigley, a belle that is still ringing beautifully.''         Correction:  October 6, 2006, Friday  An obituary on Tuesday about Isabel Bigley, who won a Tony award in 1951 playing Sarah Brown, the missionary who falls in love with a gambler in the Broadway hit ''Guys and Dolls,'' misstated the name of the organization she represented. It was the fictional Save-a-Soul Mission, not the Salvation Army.       
         Anna Russell, the prima donna of operatic parody who claimed to have begun her career as ''leading soprano of the Ellis Island Opera Company,'' who said she learned to play the French horn from an article in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and who gave indelibly grating performances of a song she identified as Blotz's ''Schlumpf'' to demonstrate what it is like to sing with ''no voice but great art,'' died on Wednesday in Bateman's Bay, New South Wales, Australia. She was 94.         Her death was confirmed by her adopted daughter, Deirdre Prussak, in an interview with the Australian ABC radio network, quoted on its Web site.         Ms. Russell's most enduring creations, now a half-century old, were associated with the most cultic portions of the art music repertory -- the works of Wagner and those of Gilbert and Sullivan. Her routines are still regularly invoked even though they can only be sampled on decades-old recordings of her performances.         Merely by telling the plot of Wagner's ''Ring of the Nibelungs'' in a voice laced with Edwardian-era class and postwar-era sarcasm, Ms. Russell affectionately sullied opera's most devotional experience.         ''I'm not making this up, you know,'' she said when her account of the plot seemed to become particularly outrageous. That became her tag line -- and the title of her 1985 autobiography.         Similarly, her instructions about ''How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera'' seemed to deflate the reputation for wit and effervescent fantasy the operettas had acquired. She provided ''all the necessary ingredients'' for do-it-yourselfers, offering a model prime example. She stirred together patter song and madrigal, paternal stubbornness and young love, class snobbery and babes switched at birth and led her star-crossed heroine, Pneumonia Vanderfeller, to happiness and ever-greater wealth.         It was, though, not as a pedagogue, musicologist, singer, analyst and critic that she made her mark, but as an entertainer. In her first major successful season, 1952-53, she performed in 37 cities in the Unites States and Canada before an estimated 100,000 listeners. Her recording ''Anna Russell Sings?'' became a best seller.         She was seen on television, Broadway, in film and on the opera stage, including appearances as the Witch in a New York City Opera production of ''Hansel and Gretel.'' By the late 1960's, she had announced her retirement, though she would occasionally emerge, like one of the aging divas she caricatured, for another farewell tour, the last, apparently, about 20 years ago.         In her routines, Ms. Russell tapped into a long tradition of deflating the highly formal manners of the concert hall and its devotees, making fun of bad voices and bad teaching, of all pomp and most circumstance, seeming like a Margaret Dumont figure from the Marx Brothers movies who had decided to join their rambunctious dismantling of pretense. But the affection and knowledge of an insider accompanied the jest, leaving the art form intact -- almost. Ms. Russell's was a career that could only have been a success at a time when classical music culture was near the center of popular awareness and public education.         Ms. Russell was born Claudia Anna Russell-Brown in London, Ontario, in Canada, on Dec. 27, 1911, though she later said she had been born in London, England, where early reports suggest her family had moved six months after her birth.         She was the only child of Colonel Claude Russell-Brown and Beatrice Magdalen Russell-Brown, and grew up in a home in which tradition, and music, ruled. For three generations every male on her father's side served in the British Army.         ''I was thoroughly done as I grew up,'' Ms. Russell told The New York Times in 1953, ''I was presented at court in 1934. I was a debutante. I was exposed to all the likely looking young men in the hope that one of them would marry me.'' One did, but the marriage was not a success. She later married Charles Goldhammer, an artist and teacher; the marriage was reported to have ended in 1954.         Ms. Russell gave a number of explanations for why her ambitions changed from being a serious singer to being a serious satirist. Ms. Russell said that one factor was that when she was 16, bones in her face were broken by a hockey stick: ''That ruined my acoustic.''         ''I had no range, no color,'' she said, ''But I could sing loud. And it grew louder and louder and awfuller and awfuller.''         That did not prevent her from singing folk songs on the BBC or studying at the Royal Academy. The main inspirational trauma for her career may have been a British touring company production of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' in which she sang Santuzza as a substitute. The tenor, who was supposed to shove her, did not expect her considerable girth and fell backward. She herself then tripped and literally brought the house down, the sets collapsing to the accompaniment of an audience roaring with laughter.         The performance was brought to an end. ''So was my career,'' she said. ''My life's work was shattered, after five years of hard preparation . . . But I got over it.''         On her first trip to New York, in 1947, she was initially met with skepticism. ''No one knew what to do with my kind of satire,'' she said. ''One agent told me, 'You can't do it in a nightclub, and you're not pretty enough to be on Broadway.' '' The key to satirizing concert life, it turns out, was to do it in concert.         After retiring in the late 1960's, Ms. Russell lived in Unionville, just north of Toronto, on a street named after her. She later moved to be with her adopted daughter in Australia, where she tried to establish a catering business.         In the 1970's and 80's, Ms. Russell would occasionally come out of retirement, like one of the aging divas she caricatured, for another ''farewell tour'' and the cheers of fans who did not mind her failing voice. She said that a friend told her: ''It doesn't matter what you sound like. You were no Lily Pons anyway.''         Correction:  October 28, 2006, Saturday  An obituary on Oct. 20 about Anna Russell, the parodist of opera, incorrectly rendered her claim of how she began her career. She said she had been the ''prima donna of the Ellis Island Opera House'' -- not the ''leading soprano of the Ellis Island Opera Company.''       
         Petra Cabot, whose first and deepest love was painting but whose most famous work was an insulated pail covered with plaid, the ubiquitous Skotch Kooler of the 1950s, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 99.         Her friend Nancy Kline announced the death. Ms. Cabot also had a home in Manhattan.         The Skotch Kooler, copyrighted in 1952, was made by the Hamilton Metal Products Company of Hamilton, Ohio. It could keep ice cream firm for two to three hours without ice and was handy for a fishing trip: it kept groceries cold on the way to the lake and fish cold on the way back.         The container held four gallons and had three layers of insulation: one of fiberglass, one of inert air and a heat-reflecting outer surface. It was airtight and waterproof and, long before the practice was common, it carried the signature of its designer. (Knockoff versions, without the signature, were made as far away as Thailand.) The coolers are now popular collectibles.         ''I decided to make the best-looking bucket anybody ever saw,'' Ms. Cabot said, according to an interview several years ago with Ms. Kline's mother, Polly Kline.         Emma Mearns, who later changed her name to Petra (pronounced PEE-tra), was an only child born in Philadelphia on Feb. 21, 1907. She was educated in crafts and fine arts and started winning design prizes in her teens.         She designed costumes and sets for stage productions, then spent a year painting in Europe. In the Depression years, she participated in two federally sponsored arts projects and became involved in the lively art scene in and around Woodstock. She also taught at the City and Country School in Manhattan.         In 1945, she designed a mural depicting the history of the National Maritime Union. It occupied 840 square feet of wall space in the union's Manhattan offices, now a hotel, and was a montage of newspaper clippings and photographs.         From 1938 until 1950, she worked for the designer Russel Wright, who brought modernism to the American home with his inexpensive, mass-produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances and textiles. One of Ms. Cabot's first assignments for Wright was the food pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939, which received favorable mention from critics.         Ms. Cabot married Laurence Jordan, a poet, when she was 19; the marriage ended in divorce in 1931. In 1937, she married Blake Cabot, a medical writer and publisher, who died in 1974. She left no immediate survivors.       
         Mary Orr, an actress and writer whose first short story, about a scheming ingénue named Eve Harrington, became the Oscar-winning film ''All About Eve,'' died on Sept. 22 in Manhattan. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, her niece Jessica Ivan said. Ms. Orr, who used the name Mary Orr Denham in private life, was a longtime resident of Manhattan.         Titled ''The Wisdom of Eve,'' Ms. Orr's story appeared in the May 1946 issue of Cosmopolitan. The film version, written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was released in 1950. It starred Bette Davis as the theatrical grande dame Margo Channing and Anne Baxter as Eve. The movie won six Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best screenplay.         Just nine pages long, Ms. Orr's story was fleshed out considerably to make a feature-length film. But in her version, the familiar antagonists are already in place: the insidious Eve, and the eminent actress -- Ms. Orr called her Margola Cranston -- whom Eve cultivates and soon betrays. The role of the caddish drama critic Addison DeWitt, for which George Sanders won an Oscar, was invented for the film.         ''A young girl is on her way to Hollywood with a contract for one thousand dollars a week from a major film company in her pocketbook,'' Ms. Orr's story begins. It continues: ''In a year or two I am sure Miss Harrington will be as much of a household word to you as Ingrid Bergman or Joan Fontaine.''         The short story is narrated by a playwright's young wife (Celeste Holm in the film), who becomes entangled with Eve. In the movie, Eve gets her comeuppance, but in Ms. Orr's version, she gets away with everything, including the narrator's husband.         By all accounts, there really was an Eve. In 1943, a play called ''The Two Mrs. Carrolls'' opened on Broadway, starring the noted Viennese actress Elisabeth Bergner. It was directed by Reginald Denham, whom Ms. Orr would marry in 1947.         Night after night, as Ms. Bergner later told Ms. Orr, a waiflike young woman stood outside the stage door. Taking pity on her, Ms. Bergner eventually invited the woman into her dressing room and later engaged her as a secretary.         As recounted by Sam Staggs in ''All About 'All About Eve' '' (St. Martin's, 2000), the woman repaid Ms. Bergner by trying to take over both her acting career and her husband, the director Paul Czinner.         After hearing Ms. Bergner's tale, Ms. Orr wrote it up and sold it to Cosmopolitan for $800. In 1949 a radio dramatization of the story, written by Ms. Orr and broadcast on NBC, caught Hollywood's attention.         Ms. Orr, who was paid $5,000 for the film rights, received no onscreen credit. (Her original story was credited, however, when ''Applause,'' a musical version of ''All About Eve,'' opened on Broadway in 1970. The musical starred Lauren Bacall as Margo and Penny Fuller as Eve.)         Mary Caswell Orr was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 21, 1910, and moved with her family to Canton, Ohio, as a girl. She attended Syracuse University before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.         With her husband, Ms. Orr wrote four plays that opened on Broadway. The first and most successful, ''Wallflower,'' ran for 192 performances in 1944. She also acted in several Broadway productions, among them ''The Desperate Hours'' in 1955.         Ms. Orr's husband, Mr. Denham, died in 1983. Besides her niece, Ms. Ivan, of Hartville, Ohio, she is survived by another niece, Lenschen Witte, of Alliance, Ohio, and three step-grandchildren.         In its July 1951 issue, Cosmopolitan published another story by Ms. Orr. Titled ''More About Eve,'' it picks up three years after ''The Wisdom of Eve'' leaves off. After middling success in Hollywood, Eve Harrington is back in New York, determined to revive her career. How she does so makes her earlier evil deeds look like child's play.       
         Phyllis Cerf Wagner, who led a whirlwind life as the socially dynamic wife of two of New York's most prominent men but who was always proudest of collaborating with a former advertising colleague, Dr. Seuss, on a series of landmark children's books, died on Friday. She was 90.         Mrs. Wagner died at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital of complications from a fall in the bedroom of the home on East 62nd Street where she had lived since 1941, said her older son, Christopher Cerf.         A newspaper and magazine columnist, movie actress, publisher, writer of radio soap operas, advertising executive and civic fund-raiser, she lived at the center of Manhattan social life, entertaining successive generations of the city's artistic and political elite, first as the wife of the Random House co-founder Bennett Cerf, then as the wife of former Mayor Robert F. Wagner.         As a hostess and occasional confidante, she hobnobbed with the most famous people of the day, including Frank Sinatra, William Faulkner and Truman Capote.         ''In my dad's day, it was theater people mixing with book people,'' said Jonathan Cerf, her younger son. ''In Bob Wagner's day, it was political people mixing with powerful people from the private sector.''         While she was a teenager in Oklahoma City, Ginger Rogers, her cousin, invited her to move to Hollywood to try acting. Family legend has it that Ginger Rogers got her stage name because as a child, Phyllis had trouble pronouncing her real one, Virginia.         With Ginger Rogers's help, Phyllis Fraser landed small roles in several films beginning in 1932, including 1934's ''Little Men'' and 1938's ''Vivacious Lady,'' though her biggest part was opposite John Wayne in ''Winds of the Wasteland'' in 1936.         By 1939, she realized acting was not her future, so she moved to New York, joined the advertising agency of McCann Erickson and began writing radio plays. She shared a desk at the agency with an illustrator named Theodor Seuss Geisel.         Years later, after he became Dr. Seuss and, in 1957, published his breakthrough book, ''The Cat in the Hat,'' Mrs. Wagner suggested to him and his wife, Helen, that they collaborate on a series of learning-to-read books. Their new imprint, Beginner Books, eventually included classic titles like ''The Cat in the Hat Comes Back'' and ''Green Eggs and Ham.''         They worked together for more than a decade and often fought, eventually parting professionally. ''They had some disagreements which were memorable,'' Christopher Cerf said. ''They were both perfectionists and would argue about every comma that went on the page.''         Shortly after she arrived in New York in 1939, Ginger Rogers introduced Phyllis Fraser to Harold Ross, editor of The New Yorker, who decided that she would make a nice match for Bennett Cerf. He introduced them at a party and they were married in 1940. Mr. Cerf died in 1971.         He encouraged her to remain professionally active, so she wrote a column for Newsday, often chronicling her encounters with celebrities. She also often took pictures for the book jackets of some of Random House's most renowned authors. Later, she wrote a household hints column for Good Housekeeping.         In the 1950s Mr. Cerf was a regular panelist on the television program ''What's My Line?'' His wife sometimes filled in as a guest panelist, and she was also a regular on the panel of an early '50s quiz program called ''Down You Go.''         A few years after her husband's death, she was introduced to former Mayor Wagner. They married in 1975. The couple lived in the same town house that the Cerfs had purchased in 1941 but made regular forays to Rome in the late '70s when Mr. Wagner was President Jimmy Carter's envoy to the Vatican.         In 1980, Mrs. Wagner co-founded the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy and worked tirelessly to raise money to revive Central Park. After Mr. Wagner's death in 1991, she returned to work, joining the advertising firm of Wells Rich Greene. Part of her job was to organize elaborate parties to attract clients.         ''My mother was an incredibly gifted hostess, wonderful at putting people together,'' Jonathan Cerf said. ''She did it with enthusiasm. But the thing that always made her proudest was those books that helped so many children learn to read.''

         Adrienne Shelly, an actress, film writer and director who first gained recognition for her roles in Hal Hartley's dark comedies ''The Unbelievable Truth'' and ''Trust,'' was found dead on Wednesday at her office in Greenwich Village. She was 40.         Grace Brugess, a spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, said yesterday that further tests would be necessary to determine the cause of death.         Ms. Shelly played leading or featured roles in more than two dozen Off Broadway plays (many at the Workhouse Theater in Manhattan), in movies and on television shows. Last year she was featured in the movie ''Factotum,'' starring Matt Dillon. She had recently finished directing ''Waitress,'' a movie she wrote and directed, which is under consideration for inclusion in the Sundance Film Festival.         Ms. Shelly wrote and directed several other independent films, including ''Sudden Manhattan'' (1997), in which zany characters collide in Lower Manhattan, and ''I'll Take You There'' (1999), a romantic comedy about a real estate broker whose wife leaves him for his best friend.         Ms. Shelly, who changed her name from Adrienne Levine, was born on June 16, 1966, in Queens. She is survived by her husband, Andy Ostroy, and a daughter, Sophie.         Ms. Shelly started performing at 9 in arts camps on Long Island and upstate. She dropped out of Boston University after her junior year and moved to Manhattan.         She got her break in movies in 1989 when Mr. Hartley cast her as the lead in ''The Unbelievable Truth,'' his bizarre comedy about a high school senior obsessed with nuclear annihilation. A year later, with Ms. Shelly in mind, Mr. Hartley revised a script he had written as a film student, ''Trust,'' another dark comedy, which touched on child abuse, abortion and mental illness. In 1993 Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Shelly was ''a spirited and captivating actress capable of perfect deadpan delivery.''         Pointing out that her acting style was often described as ''quirky,'' Ms. Shelly once said that ''when you read 'quirky' over and over again, 'quirky' starts to feel like an insult.'' In 2002 her performance in the movie ''Revolution No. 9,'' a psychodrama in which she played the fiancée of a young man slipping into schizophrenia, was described by the Times critic A. O. Scott as ''subtle and restrained.''       
         Hilda van Stockum, an award-winning children's author and illustrator whose books depicted family life in the Netherlands, Ireland, the United States and Canada, died on Wednesday at her home in Berkhamsted, England. She was 98.         The cause was a stroke, said her son John Tepper Marlin of Manhattan.         Ms. van Stockum won honors from the Newbery Medal committee in 1935 for her first book, ''A Day on Skates: The Story of a Dutch Picnic.'' Based on her own childhood experiences, the book contained illustrations by Ms. van Stockum and a preface by her aunt, Edna St. Vincent Millay.         Ms. Stockum's later books, which were written for children from the ages of 7 to 12, reflected the wanderings of her own families. ''The Cottage at Bantry Bay'' (1938) and two sequels were set in Ireland, where she spent part of her childhood. ''The Mitchells'' (1945) was the first of three books about a family like the one she and her husband reared; they lived in Washington, then moved to Canada.         In the 1960s she again began setting her books in the Netherlands, writing ''The Winged Watchman,'' about boys who helped the Dutch resistance during World War II, and ''The Borrowed House'' (1975), about a Jewish child hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam.         Hilda Gerarda van Stockum was born in Rotterdam in 1908, the daughter of a Dutch naval officer. In addition to her son John, she is survived by her daughters Olga Marlin, who lives in Kenya, and Sheila O'Neill and Elisabeth Paice , who live in Britain; her son Randal Marlin of Ottawa; 18 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Her husband of 62 years, Ervin Ross Marlin, died in 1994; a native New Yorker, he had worked for the State Department and the United Nations.         Ms. van Stockum was a painter as well. In 1993 one of her still lifes was chosen to appear on an Irish postage stamp as part of a series honoring contemporary art.       
         Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, who, with a younger brother, wrote ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' the account of their growing up in a family of 12 children that led to several movies of the same name, died on Saturday in Fresno, Calif. She was 98 and lived in Reedley, Calif.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Charles E. Carey.         ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' which became a best seller when it was published in 1948, beguiled readers with the autobiographical details of the Gilbreths, a family in the 1920's dominated by Dad but discreetly monitored by Mother. The book, replicated in numerous editions since its publication, is a testament to the intelligence, energy and eccentricity of the Gilbreth parents, who ran the family's management consulting firm.         The business focused on the science of motion study and industrial efficiencies. Frank Bunker Gilbreth believed that the factory management principles he espoused to his clients could also be applied to his family of six girls and six boys, produced in 17 years; Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who had a Ph.D. from Brown University (earned around 1915, while she had several children at home), was an industrial psychologist and an engineering expert. Mr. Gilbreth died of a heart attack in 1924 at 55, the day after Mrs. Carey graduated from high school; his wife died in 1972 at 93.         Mrs. Carey's brother Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. received first billing as a co-author, and the book's narrative voice is decidedly unified, never betraying who wrote what. Nevertheless, Mrs. Carey wrote other books (as did her brother, who died in 2001), including ''Jumping Jupiter,'' ''Rings Around Us'' and ''Giddy Moment.''         The charming havoc of ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' found a wide audience just after World War II. Mrs. Carey and her brother mined a rich vein of humorous and quirky material from the Gilbreth clan. Mrs. Carey, the third child, and Frank, the fifth, plumbed what appeared to be the best of living in a brood that size.         An outing in their Pierce-Arrow, with Dad at the wheel and babies tucked in the front seat near Mother in the days before seat belts, felt ''like a back somersault off the high diving board.'' The household was described as ''organized confusion,'' resembling a ''newspaper on election night.'' In their house in Montclair, N.J., servants took care of cooking and gardening, although every child was assigned to look after a younger sibling and performed other tasks.         Given their father's penchant for order, ''nothing was considered more of a sin in our house than wasted time and motions,'' the authors wrote. Dad, though a benevolent soul, ran a household that was above all else driven to learn. Language records were played in the bathrooms while the children washed; they absorbed French and German that was later recited at the dinner table. Mealtime could be as intense as a board meeting, since ''no one could talk unless the subject was of general interest.'' Practical jokes, centered around Dad, defused the tension.         Toward the book's end, Ern, as Mrs. Carey was called, briefly enjoyed some of the spotlight when she and her older sister, Anne (who died in 1987), began dating in high school. With her wide face and compelling gaze, she attracted many suitors. But Dad had a little trouble with this, referring to one fellow as a ''simpleton with pimples in his voice.'' That didn't stop another boy from climbing a cherry tree near Ern's bedroom to spy on her, inciting her to label him a ''sneaking Peeping Tom.''         Hollywood wasted little time, spiriting ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' into a movie by 1950, starring Myrna Loy as Mother and Clifton Webb as Dad. It was remade and modernized in 2003 with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents, with ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2'' appearing in 2005. The Gilbreth brother-and-sister team also wrote ''Belles on Their Toes,'' a 1950 sequel that was turned into a movie in 1952. In July of this year Mrs. Carey finished writing a memoir but did not want to talk about it prematurely for fear of ''bad luck.''         Mrs. Carey graduated from Smith College in 1929, with a degree in English. She worked as a department-store buyer and in management in New York City for 14 years, marrying Charles E. Carey, who died in 1986, and having two children. Her own mother eventually lived with Mrs. Carey, after a long career of mothering, teaching, writing and consulting. Mrs. Carey also gathered her mother's extensive papers and photographs to donate them to Smith College.         Mrs. Carey is survived by two brothers, Frederick Gilbreth of Larchmont, N.Y., and Robert Gilbreth, of Franklin, N.H.; her children Charles E. Carey of Livermore, Calif., and Lillian Barley of Riverdale, Calif.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Marian Marsh, a Hollywood actress of the 1930s and early '40s best known for starring opposite John Barrymore in the 1931 melodrama ''Svengali,'' died on Thursday at her home in Palm Desert, Calif. She was 93.         Ms. Marsh, who was known by her married name, Marian Marsh Henderson, died in her sleep, her daughter, Cathy Scott, said.         Mr. Barrymore handpicked Ms. Marsh, then a teenage bit player, for the role of Trilby, the virginal young singer who falls under Svengali's control. The film was based on ''Trilby,'' the 1894 novel by George du Maurier.         A petite blond actress described by critics of the day as doll-like, Ms. Marsh was also known for her performance opposite Edward G. Robinson in ''Five Star Final'' (1931). She played Sonya to Peter Lorre's Raskolnikov in ''Crime and Punishment'' in 1935. Her last film role was in the 1942 comedy ''House of Errors.''         Ms. Marsh was born Violet Ethelred Krauth on Oct. 17, 1913, in Trinidad, West Indies, where her parents ran a chocolate factory. The family moved to the Boston area when she was a child. After her older sister, Jean, became a bit player in Hollywood -- she worked first as Jean Morgan and later as Jean Fenwick -- the family relocated to California.         Following her sister into acting, Ms. Marsh began her career in the late 1920s as Marilyn Morgan. Under that name, she had a small role in ''Hell's Angels,'' the 1930 war drama directed by Howard Hughes.         Ms. Marsh's first marriage, to Albert P. Scott, ended in divorce. In 1960 she married Clifford W. Henderson, a prominent developer who was a founder of Palm Desert. Ms. Marsh founded Desert Beautiful, a conservation group, there in the early '60s.         Mr. Henderson died in 1984. Besides her daughter, who lives in Arkansas, Ms. Marsh is survived by another child from her first marriage, Albert P. Scott Jr., of Colorado; eight grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.         Interviewed about ''Svengali'' in later years, Ms. Marsh was always careful to point out that the famous shot of Trilby running across the room nude used a body double.       
         Kyoko Kishida, who starred in the landmark film ''Woman in the Dunes'' as a young widow consigned to a life of isolation and Sisyphean labor at the bottom of a sand pit, died on Dec. 17 in Tokyo. She was 76.         The cause was a brain tumor, a theater company she belonged to told Japanese newspapers.         Directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara and released in 1964, ''Woman in the Dunes'' is a bleak allegory in the fashion of films by Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni. Ms. Kishida's nameless character is trapped in a pit on a desolate shore, her sole occupation harvesting sand for the villagers who hold her. Resigned to her fate, she is joined by an entomologist who is tricked into captivity and must learn to accept the hopelessness and crushing boredom of his existence.         Beautifully filmed, with an eroticism unusual for its time, ''Woman in the Dunes'' appeared in the second New York Film Festival and won a special jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival.         ''Women in the Dunes'' was hardly Ms. Kishida's first avant-garde experience. Her father, Kunio Kishida, was an important prewar playwright who helped develop modern Japanese theater. An admirer of Ibsen and Chekhov, he wrote about Japanese characters afflicted with feelings of dislocation and disintegration.         While Ms. Kishida appeared in other films, including Mr. Teshigahara's ''Rikyu,'' she was best known in Japan for her voice-over work in animated films and television cartoons, including the long-running series ''Moomin.''         Born in 1930 in Tokyo, she was married to the actor Noboru Nakaya from 1954 until their divorce in 1978. The couple had one child. Japanese newspapers mentioned no survivors.         A hard-working actress who appeared in films until early this year, Ms. Kishida was nonetheless a devoted sleeper, according to an obituary in Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese newspaper.         ''At school, I think I slept through more than half my classes,'' she wrote in her memoir, ''Those Times, These Times.'' When she wrote haiku, she used the pen name Minjo, which means ''sleeping woman.''
