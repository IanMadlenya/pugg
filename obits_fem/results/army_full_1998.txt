         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         Dr. Emily Mudd, a onetime college dropout who trained to be a landscape architect before the trajectory of her life and her own inner fire led her to become a pioneering marriage and family counselor, died on Saturday at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 99 and widely regarded as a giant of the field she helped create.         At a time when more than 25,000 American marriage counselors treat some 2 million troubled marriages a year, it might seem a shade surprising that in 1933, when Mrs. Mudd helped form the Philadelphia Marriage Council, the field was so new there were only two other such organizations in the country.         There were also no established training programs for marriage counselors, which might help explain why her fellow organizers asked Mrs. Mudd to run the Philadelphia program even though she did not have an academic degree.         But she did have a few other credentials. For one thing, she and her husband, Stuart, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, had helped start Pennsylvania's first birth control clinic six years earlier, and her experiences there dealing with often overburdened and sometimes abused wives had led her to see the need for broader family counseling.         Then, too, Mrs. Mudd was the only wife and mother among the academics and social work specialists who met at the Mudds' home to plan the marriage council.         The men were so impressed with their hostess's drive, insights, intuition and commitment that after an elaborate search for a qualified professional, they decided she would be the best person to run the council. It certainly would have been hard to find anyone more dedicated to social change and human improvement.         As a student at Vassar when the United States entered World War I, she was so determined to do her part for the cause that she helped form a Vassar unit of the women's Land Army, established to have women work the fields in place of mobilized farmers.         Her own role in that unit and as a Vassar student came to an end when she drank some fetid water, developed typhoid fever and was advised to avoid stuffy classrooms and seek a career in the fresh air. Accordingly, she studied landscape architecture at a school in Groton, Mass., but before she could begin a career she was diverted by romance.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mudd spent a decade as her husband's unpaid laboratory assistant, first at Harvard, later at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, winning credit as co-author of 14 of his scientific papers.         After being asked to run the new Philadelphia Marriage Council, she returned to college. Working part time until she obtained a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Mudd, who eventually received her doctorate there, became the council's full-time executive director in 1936 and held the post until her retirement in 1967.         Along the way she helped lay the groundwork for virtually every aspect of professional marriage and family counseling. She formed one of the first counselor training programs, developed the first program to measure counselor effectiveness, wrote several textbooks and lectured widely here and abroad.         Only the third woman to be named to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, Dr. Mudd, who later became the first woman to become a full professor there, taught the first course at an American medical school dealing with sexuality, a speciality that led her to help edit Alfred Kinsey's book on female sexuality and to work closely with the Masters and Johnson clinic in St. Louis, to which she contributed thousands of case histories from her own practice.         After her retirement from the Philadelphia Marriage Council, now affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Mudd, who remarried after her first husband's death in 1975, continued to see patients well into her 80's. She also found time to pursue her old landscaping speciality by developing elaborate gardens at her suburban home.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Harvey, of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Margaret, of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Emily Mitchell of Concord, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Chana Timoner, a onetime housewife with such a passionate devotion to tradition and social justice that she became first a rabbi and then the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time Army chaplain, died on Monday at her home in New Haven. She was 46 and had received a medical discharge earlier this year after developing the Epstein-Barr virus.         Her husband, Dr. Julian Timoner, a chiropractor who persuaded state authorities to release the body without an autopsy, said he believed that his wife had accidentally taken a fatal overdose combination of her prescribed medication and her usual sleeping pills.         Anyone who was surprised when Ms. Timoner, then a self-styled housewife and couch potato, began five years of intense religious training at age 33 or who was surprised even more when she entered the Army and endured six weeks of grueling basic training at age 39, simply had not been paying attention.         For Ms. Timoner, a New Haven native whose father was a railroad carpenter, religion, the military and pushing limits were all family traditions.         Her Russian-born maternal grandfather had been a rabbi in New Haven, and her mother had been so eager to fight the Nazis in World War II that she joined the Canadian Army in 1940, a year before the United States entered the war and she was able to transfer to the newly organized Women's Army Corps.         By the time Ms. Timoner enrolled in Southern Connecticut State College in New Haven, she had developed expansive dreams that included later study at the University of Jerusalem.         Then she made the mistake of dropping by a local Jewish community center one night. Dr. Timoner was there, too, and, well, it's an old story, and by the time she began giving it her own personal twist, Ms. Timoner had been married at 18, had had two children by the time she graduated and had endured a grin-and-bear-it decade as a distinctly restless housewife and mother.         Ms. Timoner, who had always been deeply involved in religion and who had been struggling with herself over whether to become a rabbi, attributed her decision to begin religious studies in 1984 to a friend who told her one day: ''You know, in 7 years you could be a 40-year-old housewife or you could be a 40-year-old rabbi.''         The next day, Ms. Timoner said, ''I was on the phone,'' finding out how to enter rabbinical training.         She enrolled in the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and spent the next five years making long daily trips to New York City. Then, after her ordination in 1989, she spent two more commuting years studying for a doctorate at the New York Theological Seminary, completing the course work but deferring her dissertation.         Although she was far from the first woman to become a rabbi, most had been affiliated with the liberal Reform Jewish tradition, and as a committed adherent of the more austere Conservative tradition, Rabbi Timoner had trouble finding a post.         Then when she did find one, as rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in Wallingford, Conn., her career ran afoul of her own principles. When she refused to bend the rules to perform a bar mitzvah for a youth with a Jewish father and a gentile mother without the required religious circumcision ritual, she was forced to step down.         After working for the National Council of Christians and Jews and as a hospital chaplain, Rabbi Timoner joined the Army Reserves and in 1993 became the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time chaplain in the regular Army.         On the day in 1993 that she began her first assignment, at Fort Bragg, N.C., her husband recalled yesterday, President Clinton announced his ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in the military, prompting Rabbi Timoner to make an announcement of her own: she would gladly provide a full range of counseling for gay soldiers.         The position, which shocked her fellow chaplains at the base, was simply par for the Timoner course. When she had learned that homosexuals, even those with the AIDS virus, were being shunned by the Jewish religious establishment in Connecticut, she formed study groups for Jewish homosexuals and became active in AIDS organizations.         As the only Jewish chaplain at Fort Bragg, Rabbi Timoner held regular Friday services for the few Jewish soldiers at the base, but as the chaplain for a helicopter battalion there she spent most of her time counseling the soldiers, many of them women, none of them Jewish.         After a brief stint in Korea, where the Epstein-Barr virus and the related chronic fatigue syndrome were first diagnosed, Captain Timoner completed her Army service at Fort Benning, Ga., where, as usual, she made waves, especially when she insisted on adding prayers for Catholic, gay and gypsy victims of the Nazi terror at a Holocaust service.         No one should have been surprised. After all, when Elie Wiesel once addressed a large Jewish gathering at Yale and made an impassioned reference to ''the six million,'' Rabbi Timoner, who was sitting on the first row, had felt compelled to stand and chide him for not including the other oppressed groups who died in the gas chambers.         In addition to her husband, Rabbi Timoner is survived by her mother, Mary Surasky of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Aviva, of Paris; a son, Samson, of Germantown, Md.; a sister, Abby Sawilowsky, of Oak Park, Mich., and two brothers, Miron Surasky of Oakland, Calif., and Charles Surasky of Yardley, Pa.       
         Edith Appleton Standen, one of the world's leading authorities on tapestries and a longtime curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died last weekend at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. Standen's writings, which include an award-winning, two-volume catalogue of the Met's European post-medieval tapestries, helped broaden the interest in her speciality, which was one she never set out to have. When the Met's director offered her a curatorial position in charge of its Textile Study Room in 1949, she said yes, but added that he should know three things: she didn't know much about textiles; she cared less than most women about fashion, and she never used a needle and thread unless she had to. The subject took: until a month ago, she was at the Metropolitan every day at 9 A.M., said Thomas Campbell, an associate curator.         She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of a British Army officer, and spent her childhood in Ireland and England. She received an honors degree in English from Somerville College, Oxford University, in 1926, and immigrated to the United States two years later. In Boston, she went to work for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, founded by William Sumner Appleton, her uncle.         She is survived by a sister-in-law, Lisl Standen.         Ms. Standen also did volunteer work for the photo collection of Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. She was invited to take the legendary museum course taught by Paul J. Sachs, the Fogg's associate director. In 1929 she was hired by Joseph Widener as secretary to his art collections. This position lasted until he gave the works to the National Gallery of Art in 1942. With World War II  under way, Ms. Standen became an American citizen and joined the Women's Army Corps, ending up in Ohio working for the Air Force. In 1945, she was sent to Europe as a member of the American Military Government's Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, the group that preserved, restored and returned art plundered during the war to its rightful owners. In early 1946, she took over management of the Weisbaden Collecting Point.         Ms. Standen, who remained single all her life, worked at the Met until 1970, organizing exhibitions and writing and lecturing on textiles and paintings. Besides her 1985 catalogue, ''European Post-Medieval Tapestries and Related Hangings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' she published more than 50 articles.         After her retirement, she remained a consultant to the Met until 1988. In 1986, she began to compile a biennial newsletter about tapestries, which she distributed in the academic world. She had just completed her final article, about Beauvais tapestries, which Mr. Campbell said was to be published posthumously in the Metropolitan Museum Journal. Her archives and books are expected to be left to the Metropolitan.       
         Mildred Elizabeth Buller Smith, who cut a singular swath through the 20th century by, among other things, picking apples and digging potatoes for the Women's Land Army in World War I, riding herd on New England milk prices for the Office of Price Administration in World War II and becoming a Connecticut television celebrity as a consumer price specialist, died on Aug. 12 at a nursing home in Hartford. She was 99, and it seems almost beside the point to note that she had been an agricultural economist for the University of Connecticut.         To say that Miss Smith followed her own path would hardly do justice to someone who became a farm specialist after growing up on the streets of Chicago.         But Miss Smith, who spent several girlhood summers on a farm, was ever an original, one whose career included driving a hotel jitney in Florida, starting and running the country store for Henry and Clara Ford's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Mass., and creating and starring in ''Millie's Market Basket'' on Connecticut television.         Never one to be hampered by convention, Miss Smith went to work for the agriculture department of the Connecticut Agricultural College before she received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago; became an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut (as the agricultural college became in 1938)  before she received a master's degree from Radcliffe College, and never did bother to get a doctorate, although she did complete postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.         For someone born in the Victorian era, Miss Smith adapted well to 20th-century culture, much to the occasional dismay of her mother, a staid woman who had derived her Victorian outlook in situ, growing up in  England, and who was properly shocked when her daughter, who had not come of age in the Roaring Twenties for nothing, would go off for weekends with her young man of the moment.         (Miss Smith, whose romantic life  became a subject of intense speculation among her grandnieces and grandnephews, apparently found a satisfying solution to the problem of juggling job and family: attracting a steady supply of smitten suitors without actually succumbing to matrimony. She derived enormous delight a few years ago when she received a proposal from an admirer at her Hartford retirement community on the very day the Social Security Administration notified her that she had died -- as, it turned out, another Mildred Smith had done.)         Miss Smith's sense of personal mission began early. With three of her four older brothers serving in the military in World War I, she was so eager to do her part that, ignoring her mother's objections, she dropped out of the University of Chicago to enlist in the Women's Land Army, a paramilitary organization that sought to fill the vacuum left by mobilized farm workers.         Typically, Miss Smith, who had a lifelong fascination with statistics, not only picked apples and dug potatoes on a farm in East Corinth, Vt., but counted them, computing yields and other data for reports that she later deposited with the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe.         After the fall harvest one year, the farmer whose land she had worked tried to find her a winter job at a resort that his friend Henry Ford owned in Eustis, Fla., but wondered whether Miss Smith knew how to drive, a requirement for the job of shuttling guests to and from the train station.         In a reply that later delighted her grandnieces and grandnephews, Miss Smith reassured him: ''I've been driving tractors since I was 12.''         Indeed, Miss Smith did so well as a jitney driver that she apparently impressed Ford and his wife, Clara. In 1923, when they bought the inn made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they recruited Miss Smith to start and run the country store that became a part of the historic restoration and preservation project.         By 1931, Miss Smith had found her life's work in academia, but after a decade as a statistician and consumer price specialist at the University of Connecticut, she decided that it was time to complete her own college education.         So, again flouting convention, she returned to Chicago and received her degree at age 42.         Later, after becoming an assistant professor in 1943 and spending three years with the O.P.A.'s Boston office, she received a master's degree from Radcliffe.         She remained an assistant professor, but her work as a teacher and consumer marketing specialist -- among other things turning out pamphlets and conducting radio and television programs stressing thrift -- was so impressive that when she retired in 1961, she was named professor emeritus.         In retirement Miss Smith wrote historical pamphlets on New England agriculture and taught herself bookbinding, selling leather-bound notebooks and other items at craft fairs to finance her yen for travel, which included 18 trips to England and the Continent, where as a young woman, it should come as no surprise, she had climbed the Matterhorn.       
         Rose Blumkin, who founded the Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1937, helped her son and grandchildren build it into the nation's largest home furnishings store and continued selling carpet there well past her 100th birthday, died on Friday in Omaha. She was 104.         Mrs. B, as she was fondly known by Midwesterners who often traveled hundreds of miles to Omaha to shop at the store, was known for her credo: ''Sell cheap, tell the truth, don't cheat nobody.'' In her last years, she moved around the cavernous store on a golf cart, sometimes startling visitors by abruptly zipping away toward customers who appeared to be waiting for attention.         Mrs. Blumkin stood just 4 feet 10 inches in her prime, but her merchandising skills and daring as she made the long journey from an impoverished childhood in Russia to success led figures like Warren E. Buffett to rank her as a business giant. At one point soon after founding her store, she sold every appliance and piece of furniture in her home to pay off a debt. When furniture manufacturers stopped selling directly to her after bigger customers in Omaha complained about her low retail prices, she traveled to Kansas City, Mo., Chicago and New York, bought from department stores and still undersold her rivals.         ''Put her up against the top graduates of the top business schools or chief executives of the Fortune 500 and, assuming an even start with the same resources, she'd run rings around them,'' Mr. Buffett said in 1984 soon after Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought majority control of the Furniture Mart from Mrs. Blumkin. Based on his experience as a customer and as an acquaintance of her children, Mr. Buffett made the acquisition on a handshake without bothering to audit her books or inventory.         Mrs. Blumkin was born Dec. 3, 1893, in Schidrin, a village near Minsk, one of eight children of Solomon and Chasia Gorelick. Her father was a rabbi, and her mother ran a grocery store to support the struggling family, which lived in a two-room log cabin and slept on straw mattresses. In interviews, Mrs. Blumkin recalled working in the store at age 6, talking her way into a job as a store clerk when she was 13 and becoming manager with six men working under her three years later.         Mrs. Blumkin was 20 when she married Isadore Blumkin, a shoe salesman, soon before he fled to the United States to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army. Although unable to speak English, Mrs. Blumkin managed to rejoin him in Fort Dodge, Iowa, three years later, and the young couple moved to Omaha in 1919, where Mr. Blumkin opened a secondhand clothing store.         The Blumkins had four children by the time the Depression struck. Mrs. Blumkin encouraged her husband to cut prices, helped him branch into new products and dreamed up innovative advertising. She started her own furniture business with $500 she borrowed from a brother.         Mrs. Blumkin's own nominee for the nation's greatest businessman was her son, Louis, who became her major ally in running the Furniture Mart after returning from military service in World War II. Like her, he typically put in seven-day, 70-hour workweeks. But she began to feel frozen out of decisions as her grandchildren, Irving and Ronald Blumkin, became more involved in the 1980's. She bitterly ''retired'' in 1989 at the age of 95, but after three months returned with characteristic combativeness, setting up a rival store called Mrs. B's Clearance and Factory Outlet across the street from the Furniture Mart. By 1991, it had become profitable and was Omaha's third-largest carpet outlet.         The family eventually repaired the rift, and Mr. Buffett acquired the new venture in 1992, merging it into the Furniture Mart. He later joked with reporters that it had been a mistake he would never repeat to let Mrs. Blumkin retire without signing an agreement not to compete.         Mrs. Blumkin's husband died in 1950. She is survived by her son, Louis; three daughters, Frances Batt, Cynthia Schneider and Sylvia Cohn; two sisters, Anne Rosenblatt and Ruth Lasher, all of Omaha; a brother, Mayer Gorelick of Los Angeles; 12 grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.       
         They were the Thelma and Louise of Nazi Poland, and if Hollywood hasn't tumbled to their story, it may be because Blanca Rosenberg and Maria Rosenbloom had too many hair-raising escapes, too many improbable rescues -- and far too much unremitting horror in between -- for a single script to handle.         Then again, for all the appeal of the wily and intrepid heroines -- the blond, blue-eyed Bronislava, as Mrs. Rosenberg was known, and her brunet sidekick, Maria -- Mrs. Rosenberg's 1993 memoir, which described in rollicking and harrowing detail how the two young women survived the Holocaust while posing as Catholic peasants, left the story unfinished.         While it continues for Dr. Rosenbloom, a retired professor at the Hunter School of Social Work who lives in Manhattan, the story has now ended for Mrs. Rosenberg, and with satisfying flair.         Her death on Sept. 11 at her apartment in Manhattan -- at the age of 85, in her own bed, after a long, peaceful retirement and a distinguished career as an assistant professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work -- was a triumphant flick of her hand, almost six decades coming, to the German soldiers who had arrived in the small city of Kolomyja in eastern Poland (now Ukraine) on July 3, 1941, and tacked up posters that declared in three languages, ''Death to All Jews.''         As Mrs. Rosenberg made clear in her book, ''To Tell at Last'' (University of Illinois Press), it did not take too many aktions in the increasingly depopulated Kolomyja ghetto for it to become apparent that the Nazi regime intended to kill each and every Jew in Poland -- including those, like Mrs. Rosenberg and Dr. Rosenbloom, who had documents identifying them as essential workers at a clothing factory.         At the time of the German invasion, Mrs. Rosenberg, a native of Gorlice who had studied law at the University of Cracow, was the 27-year-old wife of a doctor who had escaped the Nazis by accepting a medical assignment with the retreating Soviet Army, leaving her behind with an infant son, Zygmund, and her adored younger brother, Romek.         Mrs. Rosenberg's son, siblings, parents and other relatives died in the Holocaust, but her husband survived. The couple were divorced after the war, and she promptly married an old flame, Sam Rosenberg, a gynecologist who became a psychiatrist in New York. Dr. Rosenberg died in 1982.         After watching her brother virtually volunteer for death during a mass ''selection,'' Mrs. Rosenberg escaped to the nearby city of Lwow armed with a birth certificate, supplied by her compassionate factory manager, belonging to a Polish Catholic woman who had died.         If she had kept to herself, Mrs. Rosenberg might have had a safer time of it. But she was continually befriending those, like Dr. Rosenbloom, whose appearance increased the likelihood that they would be unmasked.         As a ground-zero account of life on the run, Mrs. Rosenberg's book is filled with crosscuts between cities and a dizzying array of hurried apartment changes, narrow escapes and ruthless shakedowns by police officers, greedy landlords and freelance extortionists.         In one scene, for example, the young women escape through a back window of a military hospital in Lwow, where they had been working, as the police are coming in the front door (they had been betrayed by one of Dr. Rosenbloom's former college classmates who had spotted her in a bookshop). This is swiftly followed by a scene in which they make their way in disguise past wanted posters with their pictures (from their hospital identifications) at the Lwow train station, which is in turn followed by their arrival in Warsaw -- in the midst of the abortive ghetto uprising of April 1943 -- and their immediate arrest on suspicion of being Jews.         The two women spent the last months of the war working for German families in Heidelberg.         Mrs. Rosenberg said that she originally wrote her book in 1948 as a way to deal with the paralyzing guilt she felt as a Holocaust survivor, and that she published it to satisfy her brother Romek's last request that she stay alive to tell the story of the Kolomyja ghetto to the world.         She is survived by twin sons, Alex of Athens, Ga., and Mark of Coimbatore, India, and two grandchildren.       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         IN November 1939, shortly after Adolf Hitler touched off World War II, a British writer commented about the two World Wars: ''The last one was a soldier's war. This one is everybody's.''         ''And so it was,'' said an octogenarian, Ruth Kornblum, who lives in White Plains. She flew planes for the Army Air Forces in World War II and will mark another Veterans Day on Nov. 11.         Soon after Europe went to war in 1939, American men volunteered or were drafted as America prepared. But women went to war, too, going into factories, into desk jobs and into the military. Mrs. Kornblum, then Ruth Kupferberg of Eastchester, was one of them. At 25, she was single and a registered nurse. She first volunteered to join a military hospital unit but ended up as a civilian flier of military planes. The United States was still at peace early in 1941 when she was introduced to a man who operated a flying service at Little Ferry, N.J., and in the course of the friendship he taught her how to fly the company's seaplane.         The two most famous American women in aviation at that time were Amelia Earhart, who had disappeared in the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1939, and Jacqueline Cochran, who in 1953 became the first woman to break the sound barrier.         When Britain went to war, Ms. Cochran, an ambitious and daring woman, recruited 22 American female pilots to ferry warplanes in Britain. They flew Hurricanes, Mosquitos and Lancaster bombers from factories to Royal Air Force bases. Ms. Cochran once flew a bomber across the Atlantic to Britain on a lend-lease delivery.         When the United States entered the war, Ms. Cochran and the volunteers were ordered home. She made a pitch to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and to General of the Army Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, to get women involved in military flying to free men for combat air duty. There were already plenty of experienced female pilots; 500 of them belonged to the Women Flyers of America.         The Government moved slowly but finally arrived at a compromise. It gave the female fliers civil service status for what was really a military job -- ferrying planes around the country from factories to air bases and from one base to another. They eventually received uniforms that looked like officers' uniforms, wore wings and insignia that looked like officers' issue and had meals at the officers' mess at air bases. Like the men, they went through close-order drill every morning to make them march like a military group. But they were civilians under military jurisdiction. Ms. Cochran wanted officers' commissions for the female fliers, but there was pressure on Congress from thousands of civilian men who also wanted Army Air Forces commissions.         Mrs. Kornblum said that at the time her desire to learn to fly intensified and that she asked to be relieved of her enlistment in a military nursing group. She quit her nursing job and continued her flying lessons. Her objective was to attain the essential 35 hours of solo flying because Ms. Cochran, who was director of the newly organized Women's Airforce Service Pilots, had sent out a call for volunteers. As a result, 25,000 women applied, and Mrs. Kornblum was one of the 1,860 accepted as WASP's for training in April 1943. She switched from seaplanes to land planes and in winter even trained on planes equipped with skis.         The WASP's were trained at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Tex. Mrs. Kornblum and the other hopeful aviators paid for their own transportation to get there. They were in training for six months and got a $150 monthly salary, which was increased to $250 upon graduation. It was the same instruction given the male Air Corps recruits.         Mrs. Kornblum was in the sixth group to receive instruction. They studied meteorology, navigation, engines and the Morse code, and learned how to load cargo in a plane.         Searching her memory back 65 years, Mrs. Kornblum said: ''I really enjoyed it. Texans were friendly to us, inviting us to barbecues, and one rancher even sent over buffalo steaks -- remember, meat and a lot of other things were rationed.         ''We all had parachutes, and they taught us what to do if we had to bail out. However, we didn't actually make any practice jumps. Except for one girl. She got her induction to parachute jumping by mistake. ''She was flying solo in a single-engine, open-cockpit plane when she made a training spin that turned it upside down. She had neglected to tighten her seat belt and went flying into space. Luckily, she pulled the rip cord, like she had been trained, and came back to earth safely.''         Mrs. Kornblum continued: ''But, you know, you don't learn everything in class. I was flying a Cub from El Paso, Tex., to Rome, N.Y. -- an awfully long distance for a plane that flew 80 miles an hour. I had no instruments, just a compass, and I had to go over a 9,000-foot-mountain. And it was cold because we had open cockpits and no heater. That plane generally flew at 3,000 feet. I had to circle round and round, gaining a little altitude each time, until I finally got even with the peak. I cleared the top so close I could see bugs on the ground! Then I immediately had to look for a landing field because I needed gas. That trip took a week.''         But she did not think of herself as particularly courageous. Still feisty at 81, Mrs. Kornblum said: ''We all loved to fly, and we were doing our bit for the war. That's all.''         She recalled another flying incident, saying: ''Another time, we were in a group, five or six planes, flying west out of Lockhaven, Pa., and we ran into massive head winds. We weren't too high, and when we looked down on the highway we could see cars and even Amish horse and buggies traveling faster than we were. We had no radio contact, but when we saw the group leader descend -- with no airfield in sight, we all followed and landed in a grassy field to wait until the wind subsided. We had to go to a farmhouse to telephone our destination that we'd be late. The group leader told them, 'Not to worry, we're all in one piece.' ''         While Mrs. Kornblum was flying AT6's and Cubs, other WASP's flew B-17 Flying Fortresses, A-20 Havoc attack bombers and P-51 Mustang pursuit planes.         In 1977, through the intercession of Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, the WASP's were recognized for wartime military service and awarded honorable discharges, given medals and veterans' benefits.         Mrs. Kornblum does not fly anymore, but she is still active and, except for a little arthritis, fit.         One of her volunteer activities is doing ''a bit of everything'' for the Fort Hill Theater group, but she does not act herself. ''I do not perform,'' she said. ''I get cold feet!''       
         Lenore Cahn Zola, whose aid to a relative she did not know indirectly helped document the horrors of the Holocaust and who became an advocate for the elderly and sick, died on Nov. 1 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91.         A longtime member of Manhattan Community Board No. 2, she is best known for the rescue of the Village Nursing Home, 607 Hudson Street, the only home for the aged in Greenwich Village.         In 1975, state and city officials sought to close the 328-bed home because of overcrowding, poor maintenance and other problems. Mrs. Zola helped gather neighborhood petitions to stop the closing and started a $275,000 fund-raising drive to take over and improve the home. It is now a nonprofit center with 200 beds, a bigger staff and a renovated building. ''Her philosophy was an involved community is the best protection against abuse of the elderly,'' said Ann Wyatt, a friend.         Mrs. Zola and her first husband, Edmond Cahn, were also instrumental in securing a scarce exit visa from Nazi Germany in 1937 for Albert G. Rosenberg, an 18-year-old second cousin.         Mr. Rosenberg, now 81, recalled: ''My mother was desperate. The doors were closing for those of us who were Jewish. She knew only that some of her cousins had left Germany for York, Pa., and so she wrote to the Mayor of that town, who somehow found Lenore.'' The couple agreed to provide a home for Mr. Rosenberg.         In 1945, while in Army intelligence, Captain Rosenberg led the preparation of a 140-page report based on hundreds of interviews of prisoners at Buchenwald, a Nazi concentration camp liberated by the Allies. Known as the Buchenwald Report, it is considered an important piece of contemporary documentation of the Holocaust. In 1997, it was published in paperback by Westview Press and its manuscript was donated to the Holocaust Museum.         Mrs. Zola was born Lenore Lebach in Manhattan on April 26, 1907. After attending Barnard College for one year, she married Mr. Cahn, a lawyer and later a constitutional law professor at New York University, who died in 1964. In 1978, she married Albert Zola, a dentist, who died in 1997.         She is survived by a son, Edgar S. Cahn of Washington, and a daughter, Mary Cahn Schwartz of Chevy Chase, Md., three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Edwige Feuillere, a much-loved French actress whose 60-year career took her from sensual screen beauty to grande dame of the Paris theater, died here on Nov. 13. She was 91 and lived in Paris. She was buried on Wednesday in a family tomb at Beaugency, near Orleans.         Ms. Feuillere first gained renown in 1935 when, shockingly for the time, she briefly appeared naked in Abel Gance's film ''Lucrece Borgia.'' And it was as a femme fatale that she achieved her greatest stage triumph, playing opposite Jean-Louis Barrault in Paul Claudel's ''Partage de Midi'' in 1947. But she was also frequently acclaimed for her interpretation of classical roles.         ''Edwige Feuillere was our Marlene Dietrich, our Irene Dunne and our Greta Garbo, all in one,'' Le Monde wrote after her death. She retired from the stage only six years ago after a final production in which she read from her best-known roles.         ''Now people can only see me as a very old person who had a mythical life,'' she said in a recent interview with a French writer. ''Ah, if only you had seen her when she was.'' She continued: ''Well, I'd like people to remember me for my best moment. But it could be when I was 25 or 50 or 70 or in my very last show.''         Her death, which prompted a wave of tributes from French political and cultural figures, came less than one week after that of Jean Marais, the handsome, swashbuckling French actor who played opposite Ms. Feuillere in Jean Cocteau's 1947 film ''L'Aigle a Deux Tetes.'' Cocteau had created the role for her, and she first created it onstage.         Stunningly beautiful in her youth, gracefully elegant in old age, Ms. Feuillere was remembered as much for her powerful well-modulated voice as for her expressive eyes and magnetic presence. Yet for all her popularity, she showed little interest in a glamorous life style. Modest and humorous in private, she was also self-deprecating about her talent in her 1977 autobiography, ''Les Feux de la Memoire.''         Ms. Feuillere was born Edwige Caroline Cunati on Oct. 29, 1907, in the town of Vesoul in eastern France. Her mother's family, originally from Alsace, had moved back to France after Germany occupied the region in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. Her father was Italian and, because he was drafted by the Italian army in World War I, Edwige spent much of her childhood in Italy.         After the war, the family moved to Dijon in France where she showed interest in the theater by acting in school plays. In 1928 she began attending the Paris Conservatory of Dramatic Arts, and two years later she married a fellow student, Pierre Feuillere, although the marriage soon floundered because of his drug problems.         Ms. Feuillere's career -- she first used the stage name of Cora Lynn before taking her husband's name -- began slowly with small parts in several mediocre films, although she is remembered for her lead role in the film version of Marcel Pagnol's play ''Topaze.'' She also found work in the theater and was invited to join the Comedie Francaise, but she left after two years, complaining that she was being overlooked for major roles.         In 1939, she was cast as Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas's play ''La Dame aux Camelias,'' and she at last won recognition as a serious stage actor. At the time, the play's director, Jacques Hebertot, predicted, ''You will carry this role throughout your life, a slave to the success it will bring you.'' And he was right: she appeared in frequent revivals -- in France and Britain -- for the next two decades.         During Germany's occupation of France in World War II, Ms. Feuillere worked in the theater (she helped discover Gerard Philipe in Jean Giraudoux's ''Sodome et Gomorrhe'') and in films (notably in Jacques de Baroncelli's 1941 ''Duchesse de Langeais''). After the war, she appeared in 200 performances of ''L'Aigle a Deux Tetes'' before taking on another major role, which she would also perform again and again, as Yse in ''Partage de Midi.'' When she appeared in the role in London in 1968, the British theater critic Harold Hobson described her as the greatest actress he had ever seen.         Although she played an old woman in Patrice Chereau's 1974 film ''La Chair de l'Orchide,'' she virtually abandoned the cinema after 1960.  But she remained a pillar of the French theater, occasionally appearing onstage with her old movie partner Jean Marais, seven years her junior. In 1965, she created the lead role in Giraudoux's ''Madwoman of Chaillot'' and returned to the play on several occasions.         Ms. Feuillere had no immediate survivors.         She first announced her retirement in 1984, but promptly changed her mind and appeared frequently onstage throughout the 1980's. Finally, on the eve of her 85th birthday, she did retire. ''I have died so many times onstage,'' she said recently. ''My own will arrive one day, probably sooner than I expect.''         Correction:  December 3, 1998, Thursday  A picture caption on Nov. 23 with an obituary of the French actress Edwige Feuillere misstated the original nationality of the actor and director Erich von Stroheim, shown with her in an unidentified film. He was born in Austria, not Germany.       
         Rumer Godden, the prolific British author of ''Black Narcissus'' and  ''The River,'' and a writer of children's books that are enjoyed throughout the world, died on Sunday at her home in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. She was 90.         In a career that began in 1935, Ms. Godden published some 70 novels, children's books, memoirs, biographies and collections of poetry and  stories, many set in India, where she spent her childhood and had her first success as a writer. She also had the experience, rare for most authors, of seeing two of her most widely admired novels, ''Black Narcissus'' and ''The River,'' turned into films that became classics.         Ms. Godden's third novel, ''Black Narcissus'' (1939), first brought her critical attention and commercial success. It told the story of nuns in  the order of the Servants of Mary who try to overcome psychological and physical challenges to establish a hospital and school on a remote, windswept Himalaya mountain. ''Black Narcissus'' was also the first of Ms. Godden's novels to be brought to the screen, in a memorable 1946 film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger that starred Deborah Kerr, David Farrar, Kathleen Byron, Sabu, Jean Simmons and Flora Robson.         Five years later Jean Renoir, the  French director, made ''The River,'' recognized as one of the great color films, an adaptation of Ms. Godden's novel about English children growing up in Bengal. Ms. Godden adapted her novel with Renoir and said that she learned invaluable lessons from him.         ''The River'' and ''Black Narcissus'' bore many of the trademarks of Ms. Godden's work. She was frequently praised for her rich settings and sensitive psychological portraits of children and headstrong, independent women. She was preoccupied with the loss of innocence, the moral problems of childhood and the nature of time. The lyricism and evocative power she often brought to her books sometimes disguised a toughness that addressed dark themes like poverty, jealousy, violence, sexual vulnerability and prejudice.         ''Ms. Godden has a magical skill in conjuring up with a few suggestive details a veritable panorama of Indian life,'' Orville Prescott once observed in The New York Times. ''And she has a wonderful way with fictional children, tender and true and never sentimental.''         In writing about Ms. Godden's  book ''Cromartie v. the God Shiva: Acting Through the Government of India,'' published last year, Bill Vourvoulias wrote in Newsday, ''One of the delights of reading a Rumer Godden novel is the magnetic pull of the exotic settings, affecting readers and characters alike.''         An Autobiography Written at Age 7         Margaret Rumer Godden was born on Dec. 10, 1907, in Sussex, England, the second of four daughters of Arthur Leigh and Katherine Hingley Godden. The family moved to India when she was less than a year old. Her father was a steamship agent and her childhood was spent in remote river towns throughout the British-ruled subcontinent. Until she was 12, Ms. Godden was largely educated by her family in a home that she later described as ''English streaked with Indian, or Indian streaked with English.''         Ms. Godden's precocity was evident during her early days in Bengal, where she wrote a fictional autobiography at age 7, vying with her sister Jon -- who also became a writer -- for the family literary laurels. As she later recalled, ''Part of the bliss of our childhood was that, being most of the year without the normal preoccupations of most girls of our ages, there was all the time in the world to think, avenues of time.''         These years left an indelible, earthy impression of India, quite unlike Kipling's land of the Raj. She evoked this in 1966 in the memoir ''Two Under the Indian Sun,'' which she wrote with Jon: ''The feel of the sunbaked Indian dust between sandals and bare toes; that and the smell. It was the honey smell of the fuzz-buzz flowers of thorn trees in  the sun, and the smell of open drains and urine, of coconut oil on shining black human hair, of mustard cooking oil and the blue smoke from cow dung used as fuel; it was a smell redolent of the sun, more alive and vivid than anything in the West.''         After their untrammeled Indian childhood, Ms. Godden and her sisters were sent to Britain in 1920 to complete their education. The change was shocking and Ms. Godden's time in Britain unhappy and rebellious, she wrote in her memoir ''A Time to Dance, No Time to Weep'' (1988). She bounced among  five schools before finally settling at  Moira House in Eastbourne, where her writing was encouraged. Later she attended ballet school despite a childhood spinal injury and was hooked on dance.         A Love of Dance And of Children         Ms. Godden returned to India in 1925 and opened a dancing school for children in Calcutta three years later, one of the first of its kind in that city. Overcoming social opprobrium, she operated the school for eight years. She considered a career as a choreographer, but in 1934 she married Laurence Sinclair Foster, a charming stockbroker and gambler  whom she later described as a philistine ''who thought Omar Khayyam was a curry.'' Their first child died shortly after birth, at the same time that Ms. Godden's first novel, ''Chinese Puzzle'' (1935), was accepted for publication. Although the couple subsequently had two daughters, their marriage ended in 1941 after Foster joined the army, leaving Ms. Godden with the children and huge gambling debts.         She moved with her children from Calcutta into the mountains of Kashmir, living in an isolated house set amid almond and cherry orchards. She supported her family through writing, teaching the local children, watching over the children of women doing war work in Calcutta, and selling herbal teas. She even survived a crazed cook's attempt to poison her before moving permanently to England in 1945.         Ms. Godden chronicled this time in ''Rungli-Rungliot'' (1943) and ''Bengal Journey'' (1945) and in other novels that addressed the transition from childhood to adolescence against the backdrop of life in colonial India. ''Kingfishers Catch Fire,'' a 1953 novel, concerned a widow and her two children living in Kashmir among people so poor that even a nail is worth stealing. The vicissitudes of time on family history was the theme of several of her novels set in Britain.         In London, in 1949, she married James Haynes-Dixon, a civil servant. Their marriage ushered in a long period of happiness, during which she continued to write, living  in London's Highgate section and in Henry James's Lamb House in Rye. Mr. Haynes-Dixon died in 1975. Ms. Godden is survived by two daughters, Paula Kenilworth and Jane Murray Flutter; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.         Acclaimed Novels That Became Films         Ms. Godden's novel ''The Greengage Summer,'' a critically acclaimed story about the sexual awakening of a teen-age girl in a pre-World War II French village, appeared in 1958; a film based on it called ''Loss of Innocence,'' starring Kenneth More, Danielle Darrieux and Susannah York, was released in 1961. ''The Battle of the Villa Fiorita'' (1963), a novel set in Italy about an adulterous affair seen through the eyes of two children who refuse to allow their mother to leave them and establish a new life, was also made into a film. So was ''In This House of Brede'' (1969), about a sophisticated London businesswoman who becomes a Benedictine nun.         To do research on ''In This House of Brede,'' Ms. Godden lived for three years near Stanbrook Abbey. Her experience with the nuns there contributed to her decision to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1968. In many of her stories and novels, Ms. Godden would write about the rewards and perils of the contemplative life.         Among her other work was ''Mooltiki: Stories and Poems from India'' (1957); ''A House with Four Rooms'' (1989), which takes up where ''A Time to Dance'' ended, and ''The Peacock Spring'' (1975), a novel about a British father and daughter in India who fall in love with Asians.         ''The Doll's House,'' the first and perhaps best known of her nearly two dozen children's books, appeared in 1947. The book told of a family of Dutch dolls owned by two girls in London. Like children, the dolls cannot act independently, but they can feel and wish for rooms of their own and comfortable feather beds. It was followed by many stories that interwove the lives of humans and dolls.         Ms. Godden did not patronize her younger readers and she had decided ideas about how to write for them. ''There are several things children  will not put up with in a book,'' she once observed. ''You have to have a proper beginning and end; you cannot have flashbacks. Then, you can't have a lot of description. And you must be very careful with words. They have to fit the case exactly and be chosen with extreme care.''         Ms. Godden's interest in children's literature also led her to write a biography of Hans Christian Andersen, compile a children's edition of Emily Dickinson's poems and translate two collections of verse by the French poet Carmen Bernos de Gasztold. She was given many prizes for her children's books and was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1993.         Two years after her husband's death Ms. Godden moved to Scotland to live with her daughter Jane. She continued her routine of writing in the mornings and tending to her Pekingese dogs. She continued to write  widely translated children's books like ''The Little Chair'' (1996) and adult romances like ''Pippa Passes'' (1994), the story of a novice ballerina who falls in love with a gondolier in Venice.         She wrote into her final years and  never forgot India, returning to it in novels like ''Coromandel Sea Change'' (1991). ''To me and my kind,'' she once wrote, ''life itself is a story and we have to tell it in stories -- that's the way it falls. I have told the truth, yet not the whole truth, because that would be impossible.''
