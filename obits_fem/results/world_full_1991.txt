         Eleanor Schley Todd, a former Republican National Committeewoman, died on Monday at her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.         She was also active in civic affairs. In 1983, Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Board of Higher Education, where she served until 1988. She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.         Mrs. Todd was born in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and was educated at the Chapin School, the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., Barnard and Sarah Lawrence Colleges and at Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1967.         She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Janet Woodbury Adams, an authority on decorative screens, died Sunday at Hazelfield, the family farm in Jefferson County, W. Va. She was 60 years old.         Mrs. Adams died of cancer, said her husband, Wiliam Howard Adams, a lawyer and historian.         She was the author of "Decorative Folding Screens: 400 Years in the Western World" (1982; Viking) and curator of "The Folding Image," an exhibition sponsored by Yale University Art Gallery that opened in 1984 at the National Gallery of Art.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1951.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Sarah W. Adams, a historic preservation specialist of Ithaca, N.Y., and Mary Chatham, an artist of Manhattan, and a son, William S., a lawyer, also of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Rosenman, an authority on housing and a lifelong advocate of low-cost housing, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She began her public-housing activites in the 1920's when she was asked by Ira Robbins, chairman of the housing committee of the United Neighborhood Houses, which represented all the settlement housing in New York City, to help amend the old tenement laws.         Throughout her career, she worked to make the public and legislators aware of the need for community improvement and planning.  Housing for War Workers         In 1933, Mrs. Rosenman became chairwoman of the investment housingcommittee of the Citizens Housing Council of New York and, on its formation in 1941, she was named chairwoman of the National Committee on Housing, where she championed emergency housing for war workers. She spent the early part of World War II in Washington, urging the War Department to release critical materials for emergency housing.         In addition to many magazine articles, she was the author of "A Million Homes a Year," (Harcourt Brace, 1945) and, with her husband, Samuel I. Rosenman, an adviser to Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, she wrote "Some Giants and a Pygmy in the White House," (Harper & Row, 1976). Mr. Rosenman died in 1973.         She was born Dorothy Ruben in Manhattan and graduated from the Montessori Training School in 1918, supplementing her education with studies at Columbia University.         Mrs. Rosenman is survived by two sons, James Rowen and Robert Rosenman, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Marie Provaznik, a leader of the nationalist Sokol gymnastics movement in Czechoslovakia who defected to the United States after directing the Czechoslovak women's contingent at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, died on Jan. 11 at St. Clair's Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y. She was 100 years old, and her family said she suffered a stroke two weeks earlier.         As the leader of 500,000 women in the Czechoslovak Sokol organizations after World War II, Mrs. Provaznik was regarded in her homeland as a national heroine.         Sokol, the Czech word for falcon, symbolizing freedom, was established in 1863 to combine athletics suggestive of an army in training with national democractic resistance. Allowed to Keep Position         At the time of her defection in 1948, the year a Communist Government took over her country, Mrs. Provaznik was president of the women's divisions of both the Czechoslovak gymnastics organization and the International Gymnastics Federation in Geneva.         She was also such a popular figure that when the nation's Sokol leaders were arrested after the Communist takeover Mrs. Provaznik was allowed to retain her position.         Indeed, even after she announced that she would not return to Czechoslovakia after the 1948 Summer Games because "it is the only way to be a free agent," a spokesman for the Czechoslovak Embassy in London praised her as a "fine instructor" and an "outstanding athlete," and declared that she was going to the United States "with the blessing and knowledge of Prague."  Taught in New Jersey         In the United States, Mrs. Provaznik, who became an American citizen in 1954, taught physical education at Panzer College in New Jersey, and was active in Sokols established in New York and elsewhere.         Mrs. Provaznik, whose husband, Frantisek, died in 1948, is survived by a daughter, Dr. Alena Polesny, of Altamont, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Princess Ileana of Romania, who was known as Mother Alexandra after becoming a nun, died at midday yesterday in St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, Mother Christophora, abbess of the Monastery of the Holy Transfiguration, said.         An aunt of former King Michael of Romania, she was 82 years old and had been a nun at the monastery, which is a community of nuns of the Orthodox Church in America in Ellwood City in western Pennsylvania, for 22 years.         Mother Alexandra, who founded the convent in 1968 and was its abbess from 1969 to 1980, fractured her hip in a fall there on Jan. 4, entered the hospital that night, suffered a massive heart attack on Jan. 8 and died of heart failure, Mother Christophora said.         She was born Jan. 5, 1909, the youngest of the five children of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Romania, and was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.  Brother Becomes King         Her eldest brother became King Carol II of Romania, and at his behest she was married in her early 20's to Archduke Anton of the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and left Romania. She returned to her homeland in 1940 but was forced to leave in 1948 by the Communist Government.         She eventually came to the United States, carrying an heirloom diamond and sapphire tiara wrapped in a nightgown, and settled in Newton, Mass. She divorced the Archduke, who had served in the German Air Force during World War II, in 1954 and supported herself and her children by giving lectures on such topics as her life, Romania and world peace.         Her second marriage, to Dr. Stefan Issarescu, ended in divorce and then, with her children grown up, she became a nun of the Orthodox Church in the convent of the Protection of the Holy Virgin in Bussy-en-Othe in east-central France before going on to found the convent in Pennsylvania. After retiring as abbess at that convent, she continued an active life there and as a speaker on religious topics around the country.         She traveled to Romania in September, her first visit since 1948, to see the graves of her parents.  Author of Several Books         Her writings include a volume of memoirs, "I Live Again" (1952), and several books on spiritual and religious subjects including "Meditations on the Nicene Creed" (1958).         She is survived by three daughters from her first marriage, Alexandra, who lives in West Germany, and Magdalene and Elisabeth, who live in Austria; and two sons, Stefan, of Detroit, and Dominic, of Venice.         The former King Michael, who was ejected from Romania by the Communists shortly before Princess Ileana, now lives in Geneva.       
         Mary de Groat Reed, a leader in the reform wing of the Democratic Party in Manhattan in the 1950's, died on Tuesday at the Southampton Nursing Home on Long Island. She was 77 years old and lived in Sagaponack, L.I.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Reed, a native of Duluth, Minn., was a graduate of Wells College and held a master's degree from the University of Geneva. In World War II she was with the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington.         She was a founder of the New Democratic Club in the Eighth Assembly District South on the East Side, one of the first clubs in what was to become the reform movement in the party. She was elected district leader in 1955 and 1957. She left New York in 1959, but remained active in Democratic politics.         She is survived by two daughters, Julia, of Manhattan, and Cornelia, of Sagaponack.       
         Alberta Masiello, a longtime singers' coach at the Metropolitan Opera and a regular panelist in the Saturday afternoon Metropolitan Opera Quiz, died on Christmas Day at her Manhattan apartment. She was 75 years old.         Her physician, Dr. Sidney Goldstine, said she had been suffering from a long illness.         Miss Masiello was born in Milan, Italy, into a family of singers; her mother, Josephine La Puma, had a subsequent career with small opera companies in New York City. Trained as a pianist at the Milan conservatory, Miss Masiello moved to the United States with her mother in the late 1930's, where she studied further at the Juilliard School.         Gravitating to singing, she had a brief career as a mezzo-soprano, appearing in nightclubs during World War II and as Carmen and in other roles at the fledgling New York City Opera in the 1940's. But she soon devoted herself to vocal coaching, working privately in Manhattan and at the Chicago Lyric Opera in the 1950's before joining the Metropolitan in 1959.         Her initial title was rehearsal pianist, but in 1967 that was upgraded to assistant conductor, although she never conducted a performance at the Met. Her task was to prepare singers and accompany rehearsals of the mainstream Italian repertory. She retired from the Met in 1981.         Miss Masiello was best known for her frequent appearances on the Metropolitan Opera Quiz, an intermission feature of the Metropolitan's nationally broadcast Saturday matinee performances. There her store of knowledge and imperious manner beguiled listeners for more than 30 years, from her first appearance in 1959 as an accompanying pianist, to her last, in the spring of 1990.         There are no survivors.       
         Rhoda Bacmeister, an authority on early childhood education who directed nursery schools and wrote eight books about children, died on Wednesday at All Saints Catholic Nursing Home in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 97 years old and lived in Clemson, S.C.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Bacmeister taught at the Manhasset Bay School in Port Washington, L.I., in the 1930's. In World War II she set up day-care centers in Philadelphia for children of women working in war plants. After the war she was director of the Manhattanville Nursery School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She was a native of Northampton, Mass., and a graduate of Vassar College and the University of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree.         Mrs. Bacmeister wrote four books on early childhood education and four on literature for children.         She is survived by two daughters, Lucretia Harrison of Port Washington and Margaret Gruger of Anderson, S.C.; a son, Theodore, of Jacksonville; five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         LuEsther T. Mertz, a general partner in Publishers Clearing House who was known for her extensive philanthropy on behalf of the arts and other causes, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 85 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         She had had several strokes in recent weeks, said her lawyer, William B. O'Connor.         Mrs. Mertz became a general partner in Publishers Clearing House, the magazine-subscription business, soon after its founding in 1953 by her husband, Harold E. Mertz, and their daughter, Joyce Mertz Gilmore. She and her husband were later divorced.         She was the chairman of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival from 1973 to 1987 and underwrote moving several of its productions from the Public Theater to Broadway, including "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Chorus Line."         Recalling her support for the arts and her interest in social justice, Mr. Papp said that despite her wealth, "there was nothing in her that suggested anyone was different from anyone else." He described her as high-spirited but said she "never wanted to be in the spotlight."         Mrs. Mertz, a longtime supporter of dance, was on the board of the Original Ballets Foundation, which operates the Feld Ballets/NY and the New Ballet School. She also supported the New York City Ballet. The Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, which opened in 1982 and is devoted to dance, is named in memory of her daughter, who died of cancer in 1974. Literature on Tape         In 1961 she founded Choice Magazine Listening in Port Washington for people who are unable to read regular print. The organization selects articles, fiction and poetry from contemporary periodicals, records them on cassette tapes and distributes the tapes free. To endow the organization, she set up a private foundation, the Lucerna Fund.         The LuEsther T. Mertz Retinal Research Center at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is named for Mrs. Mertz.         She was a major contributor to many New York City cultural and educational institutions, including Lincoln Center and the New York Botanical Garden, and received the Mayor's Award for Arts and Culture in 1983 and the New York State Governor's Arts Award in 1986.         In recent years, she was chairman of the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation, which supports nonprofit activities in human rights, world security and the environment and New York City cultural and civic programs.         She was a trustee of the Port Washington Public Library and a founding member of the Port Washington League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Mertz, whose maiden name was Turner, was born in Cincinnati and grew up in Williamsport, Pa. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1927 with a degree in library science.         Her son, Peter, died in an accident in 1954. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Alice Vansteenberghe, a World War II Resistance hero and physician who testified against the Nazi Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie, has died, officials said Tuesday. She was 82 years old.         No cause of death was given.         At Mr. Barbie's war-crime trial in 1987, Dr. Vansteenberghe said that Mr. Barbie tortured her and broke her back after her arrest in 1944. Dr. Vansteenberghe, who died Saturday, was confined to a wheelchair.         Dr. Vansteenberghe said she recognized Mr. Barbie's irregularly shaped ear lobe, which she had memorized while he was torturing her.         She and her husband, Andre, were active in the underground group Straight-Shooters. Both remained in the Lyons area after the war and practiced medicine.         Her husband died last year.         Mr. Barbie headed the Gestapo section that captured Jean Moulin, leader of the Resistance. Mr. Moulin died under torture in 1943.         Mr. Barbie, who lived in Bolivia for many years after the war, was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity.       
         Ruth Mary Hill, a teacher and a vice president of Friends World College in Westbury, L.I., died on Feb. 6 in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 73 years old and lived in Fort Myers and Fort Myers Beach.         Mrs. Hill died of esophageal cancer, a son said.         She was associate director of Friends World Institute, which was founded in East Norwich, L.I., in 1965 by the Religious Society of Friends as a four-year experimental program of world education. It later became Friends World College and moved to Huntington, L.I. In the 1970's, she founded the Lower Bay School in Bequia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.         Earlier in her career, she worked with Edward R. Murrow during the 1950's, editing his radio scripts.         She born in Roslyn, L.I., and graduated from Swarthmore College.         She is survived by her husband, James, a retired labor mediator; two sons, Lewis, of Staten Island, and Emory, of Seattle; two daughters, Julia, of Mirano, Calif., and Carolyn Lewis of Fort Myers, and eight grandchildren.       
         Helen Watson Buckner, a philanthropist, died yesterday at her home in Gulfstream, Fla. She was 73 years old and also had residences in Manhattan and on Fishers Island, N.Y.         Mrs. Buckner died after a stroke, a family spokesman said.         She spent most of her life as a volunteer and financial benefactor. She was a member of the Salvation Army's advisory board; vice chairwoman of the board of managers of the New York Botanical Garden; a trustee of the Brick Presbyterian Church; a board member of the Young Women's Christian Association, and a member of the national Y.W.C.A.'s World Service Council.         She is survived by two sons, Thomas, of Manhattan, and Walker Jr., of Boston; two daughters, Mary Shea of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Elizabeth, of Manhattan; a brother, Thomas J. Watson Jr., the former chief executive of the International Business Machines Corporation, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Linda Marmelstein, an independent television producer, died Monday at the Cabrini Hospice. She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said a spokeswoman for Daniel Wilson Productions, where she had worked since 1969.         Among the productions she worked on were the mini-series "Hemingway"; the NBC television movie "The Great Wallendas"; a young people's series for CBS, "Henry Winkler Meets William Shakespeare," and "Secret of Charles Dickens."         Most recently, Ms. Marmelstein was working on a series of specials, "The Next Decade: The 90's, Our World in Transition."         Her longtime companion was Royal J. Wilds.         She is survived by her mother, Ann, of Washington and a brother, Charles, of Potomac, Md.       
         Dame Margot Fonteyn, whose blend of refinement and passion redefined 20th-century ballet style and made her an international idol as the prima ballerina of the Royal Ballet in Britain, died yesterday in Paitilla Hospital in Panama City. She was 71 years old and lived on a farm near La Quinta Pata, Panama.         Jane Hermann, the director of American Ballet Theater, said that she had been told of Dame Margot's death by telephone by Querube Brillenbourg, the ballerina's stepdaughter. Mrs. Brillenbourg said that Dame Margot had been ill for two and a half years but gave no further details. The Associated Press reported that Louis Martins, a friend of Dame Margot, said she did not want people to know she had cancer.         The impact of Dame Margot's career was so strong that successive generations of viewers identified her with distinct phases in their own dancegoing experience.         Most associated her with one of the greatest ballet partnerships in history when she and Rudolf Nureyev dazzled audiences in the 1960's and 1970's. Performing regularly, sometimes annually, in the United States for 15 years, the team was unsurpassed in critical acclaim, box office success and public adulation.         But Dame Margot was a superstar in her own right long before the term came into use. She sealed the reputation of the young British company that became the Royal Ballet when she conquered New York in 1949 as the radiant Princess Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty." The English-born ballerina was associated with the growth of British ballet since 1934, and her effortless artistry was equated with a British style.         Dame Margot was also known as the muse of England's great choreographer, Sir Frederick Ashton, who created many of his major works for the young dancer whom he helped develop. Together they defined the lyrical side of 20th-century classicism in ballet. And yet as Dame Margot often demonstrated in her dancing, the ballerina with the openly well-bred style was also capable of a rush of passion -- an emotional outpouring that she made unforgettable in "Swan Lake," "Romeo and Juliet" and "Marguerite and Armand," which Sir Frederick choreographed as a vehicle for her and Mr. Nureyev in 1963.         Dame Margot was known for her musicality, beauty of line, inner radiance and refinement. Most of England's leading male dancers were her partners, and as noted by one, Michael Somes, their wish was to act as cavaliers -- to step back and to show her off. Sacheverell Sitwell, the British poet and essayist, said Dame Margot could be compared only "to a bird of beautiful plumage taking pleasure and exulting in its wings."         The New York Times dance critic John Martin analyzed her artistry in 1953 when he wrote: "She has a muscular awareness of the phrase which automatically translates music into movement, and her scale is beautifully sensitive, so that there is endless color in her movement. But beyond this, there is a feeling for choreographic form that gives shape and substance to the composition of what she is dancing, to a degree that one has never seen equaled in the ballet."  Studied Dance as a Child         Dame Margot was born Margaret Hookham in Reigate, Surrey, on May 18, 1919. Her father was an English engineer; her mother was half-Irish, half- Brazilian. As a child, she studied at dancing schools in the London area.         Her family moved around (she lived in Kentucky at one point), and when her father found work in China, she studied with George Goncharov, a Russian-born dancer who had settled in Shanghai. When she began to show talent, she and her mother returned to London, where she attended the school attached to the Vic-Wells Ballet (as the Royal Ballet was then known).         The teen-ager made her debut with the Vic-Wells as a snowflake in "The Nutcracker" in 1934. Borrowing her mother's maiden name, she initially danced as Margot Fontes, but soon modified her stage name to Fonteyn. Her brother, Felix, a photographer, also adopted Fonteyn as a professional name.         In 1935, Dame Margot received her first solo role, that of Young Tregennis, a doomed aristocrat, in "The Haunted Ballroom," a ballet by Ninette de Valois, the founder of the Royal Ballet. That same year, Sir Frederick created the role of the bride for her in "Le Baiser de la Fee." At the time, she told her mother: "Frederick Ashton is absolutely mad. His steps are impossible," but the dancer and the choreographer established an astonishing rapport. And Dame Margot later said, "There can be no doubt that my happiest moments on stage have been in Ashton ballets."         Sir Frederick often cast her as a frail or otherworldly being. In "Apparitions" (1936) she was an artist's unattainable vision, while in "Nocturne" (1936) she portrayed a poor flower seller wistfully watching rich people at a ball. But Sir Frederick also gave her a comic role in "A Wedding Bouquet" (1937), emphasized her charm in "Les Patineurs" (1937) and made her a classical soloist in such abstractions as "Symphonic Variations" (1946) and "Scenes de Ballet" (1948).         Other Ashton ballets in which she created starring roles included "Daphnis and Chloe" (1951), "Sylvia" (1952) and "La Peri" (1956). She charmed the public in Sir Frederick's "Ondine" (1958), which concerned a water spirit in love with a mortal, and she singled out the work as "my happiest ballet."  Widening Her Range         The ballerina herself noted that she had difficulty with styles foreign to her temperament. She was defeated by the speed necessary for the main role in George Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial." But she widened her range successfully and dramatically when she performed as a guest artist with Roland Petit's company in Paris in 1948.         Dame Margot appeared in productions by several contemporary choreographers, among them Sir Kenneth MacMillan's version of "Romeo and Juliet." In 1975, she danced in Martha Graham's "Lucifer" as a guest artist with the Graham company in Manhattan. She also excelled in classics like "Swan Lake," "Giselle" and Michel Fokine's "Firebird," which she imbued with a flashing brilliance.         Her most memorable classical portrayal was that of Princess Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty." The Sadler's Wells Ballet (as the Vic-Wells was renamed before it became the Royal Ballet) made its United States debut in 1949 with the 1890 classic by Marius Petipa. The full four-act version was virtually unknown in this country. Dame Margot, then 30 years old, stunned the audience in the Metropolitan Opera House with her performance as the youthful Aurora.         "When she comes bounding in with all the young joyousness in the world at her first entrance in the birthday party scene," Mr. Martin, the Times critic, wrote, "the lights somehow seem to become brighter and the air fresher, and you know you are in the presence of magic."         Dame Margot's partners over the years included British ballet's major male dancers, among them Mr. Somes, Robert Helpmann and David Blair. Then in 1962, when she was 42 and was reportedly giving thought to retirement, she starred with Rudolf Nureyev, a 23-year-old defector from the Kirov Ballet of Leningrad, in the Royal Ballet's production of "Giselle," and an electrifying new partnership developed.  'She Represents Eternal Youth'         Dame Margot declared of Mr. Nureyev: "Something quite special happens when we dance together. It's odd because it's nothing we discussed or worked on, yet there in the photos both heads will be tilted to exactly the same angle, both in perfect geometric relationship to each other." And Mr. Nureyev said of Dame Margot, "For me, she represents eternal youth."         Sir Frederick created "Marguerite and Armand" (1963), an adaptation of Dumas's "Dame aux Camelias," for the stars, and they danced together with the Royal Ballet and as guests with other companies. Dame Margot continued to be a globe-trotting ballerina until the late 1970's, after which she made occasional guest appearances in mime roles; during the New York season of La Scala Ballet in 1981, she was Lady Capulet in "Romeo and Juliet."         Dame Margot married Dr. Roberto Arias, a Panamanian diplomat, in 1955. Nine years later, he was nearly paralyzed in an assassination attempt, and even as she maintained a strenuous performance schedule, Dame Margot devoted herself to his care until his death in November 1989.         She was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and Dame of the Order of the British Empire in 1956. The Royal Ballet also officially named her its prima ballerina, although that title has rarely been used outside Russia in the 20th century.         Dame Margot, who occasionally coached younger dancers, helped members of the Houston Ballet in "Swan Lake" in 1989. On May 30, 1990, the Royal Ballet offered a gala performance of "Romeo and Juliet" in her honor at the Royal Opera House at which Sylvie Guillem and Jonathan Cope portrayed the young lovers and two of Dame Margot's former partners were seen in supporting roles. Mr. Nureyev was Mercutio and Mr. Somes came out of retirement to play Lord Capulet.         Dame Margot was the author of "Margot Fonteyn: An Autobiography" (1975) and "The Magic of Dance" (1979), based on a widely seen television series on dance history for which she was the commentator.         Summing up her career in her autobiography, she said: "My attitude has never changed. I cannot imagine feeling lackadaisical about a performance. I treat each encounter as a matter of life and death. The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference between taking one's work seriously and taking one's self seriously. The first is imperative and the second disastrous."         In addition to Mrs. Brillenbourg, of New York City, and her brother, Felix, of London, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Rosita Arias, and a stepson, Roberto Arias, both of Panama.       
         Elizabeth Blume Silverstein, one of the first women to practice law in New Jersey, died on Sunday at New York University Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Nathan Royce Silverstein, a lawyer who lives in Manhattan.         A 1911 graduate of the New Jersey Law School, now Rutgers Uniersity School of Law, Mrs. Silverstein was admitted to the bar in 1913 and soon after opened her own office in Newark. She maintained the office until the mid-1980's when she gradually retired. She was one of the first women in New Jersey to try a criminal case before a jury and to handle a homicide defense alone.         She was an expert on criminal law and was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court in 1922. She served as vice president of the Woman Lawyers Association, the Business Women's League and the Commercial Law League of America. She was a delegate to the 1932 Republican National Convention, and in the 1930's served on the executive board of the American Jewish Congress.         Together with her late husband, Max Silverstein, and the late Rabbi Stephen Wise, she helped found the World Jewish Congress, which first met in Geneva in 1936.         Besides her son, she is survived by a sister, Blanche Blum of Miami Beach, Fla.       
         Charlotte Baruth, a former president of the New York Federation of Women's Clubs, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her grandson Charles Hutson of Washington, said.         Mrs. Baruth, who was active in civic affairs, headed the Federation in the mid-1950's. She was also involved in aiding disabled veterans after World War II.         A native of Hernando, Miss., she had been a former director of audience services for Ed Sullivan Productions in the 1950's and 60's. Her first job was in silent films.         Her husband, Alfred, a teacher at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, died in 1981.         She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Hutson of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Corinne Prevost Abel, a volunteer active in civic causes around the world, died last Friday in Colwell, England. She was 66 years old and lived in Palo Alto, Calif.         Her husband, Elie Abel, former dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said she had been in a deep depression and had taken her own life. Mr. Abel was conducting a seminar in England.         A graduate of the University of Maryland, Mrs. Abel was a docent at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and a volunteer at Stanford Medical Center. Earlier, when her husband was a foreign correspondent, she was the ORT representative in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and worked at a clinic for autistic children in London.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Mark, foreign editor of The San Francisco Chronicle; a daughter, Suzanne Abel-Vidor, director of the Grace Hudson Museum in Ykiah, Calif.; a brother, Arthur C. Prevost of Sunnyvale, Calif., and one grandchild.       
         Maria Eisner Lehfeldt, a photo editor and agent who was a founder of the Magnum photo agency, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         Mrs. Lehfeldt, a native of Milan, Italy, was educated in Germany and started Alliance Photo, an agency in Paris, in the 1930's. She came to the United States in the early days of World War II.         In 1947 she brought together five photojournalists -- Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, David Seymour, George Rodger and William Vandivert -- who formed the creative core of Magnum.         Mrs. Lehfeldt is survived by her husband, Hans; a son, Richard, of Washington, D.C., and two grandchildren.       
         Helen Lee Caldwell, a leading designer of children's clothes in Manhattan for three decades under the name Helen Lee, died on Wednesday at Fort Sanders Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn. She was 82 years old and had lived in Knoxville since 1981.         She died after a series of strokes, a spokesman for the family said.         In 1953 she became the first children's designer to win the Coty American Fashion Critics Award, for her designs for Youngland Inc. The award cited her "significant influence in the development of good taste and charm in children's fashions."  Clothes for Girls and Boys         For the next three decades, Miss Lee designed clothes for infants, girls, boys and teen-agers. She also created designs for Sears, Roebuck & Company; Saks Fifth Avenue; Alyssa, a children's fashion concern, and for her own company, Designs by Helen Lee Inc.         Despite the reputation of English children's clothes as the best in the world, her designs won accolades from critics at a London fashion show in 1962. One of the models, 3-year-old Cathryn Harrison, the granddaughter of the actor Rex Harrison, wore a white eyelet dress sashed with yellow and cried when asked to take the dress off after the showing.         A 1965 showing in Tokyo was received with equal enthusiasm by an international audience.  Designs Shown in Moscow         Miss Lee's designs appeared at the American Fair in Moscow in 1959 and in a dress worn by her granddaughter, Hilary Ball, on the cover of Life magazine in 1959.         As designer and partner of Alyssa, she received a Neiman-Marcus Award in 1958 and the Ethel Traphagen Award in 1970. She retired in the late 1970's.         Miss Lee was born in Knoxville and attended the University of Tennessee before coming to New York, where she studied at the Art Sudents League and at the Traphagen School of Art.         She is survived by a daughter, Jenny Higginbothan Caldwell of Newton, Mass., five grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Jean Tennyson Boissevain, an operatic soprano and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland. She was 86 years old.         She died in her sleep, her goddaughter, Dorothy Blencowe, said.         Mrs. Boissevain appeared, as Jean Tennyson, with several leading European and American opera companies, including La Scala in Milan, the Chicago Civic Opera and the San Francisco Opera Company. She also sang on the CBS Radio program "Great Moments in Music" from 1942 to 1946.         Mrs. Boissevain was born in Chicago and married Camille Dreyfus, the founder and chairman of the Celanese Corporation of America, in 1931. After his death in 1965 she served as president of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, which supports scientific education and research. Her second husband, Ernest W. Boissevain, died in 1984.         After World War II, she founded the Artists Veterans Hospital Programs of the Musicians Emergency Fund, which presented concerts for patients in veterans hospitals. She also served as a patron of the Philharmonic Society of New York and as vice chairman of the Lewisohn Stadium Concerts.         Mrs. Boissevain received several awards, including the Italian Stella della Solidarieta and the St. Olaf Medal from the King of Norway.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Lola Popper Kramarsky, former president of Hadassah, the national women's Zionist organization, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kramarsky was president of Hadassah from 1960 to 1964 and was active in the organization for much of her adult life. Her particular concerns were with Youth Aliyah, which rescues and rehabilitates displaced children, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centr in Jerusalem.         She retired from active Hadassah involvement in 1985. At her death she was an honorary vice president of the organization, whose current membership is 385,000.  Owned Noted Art Collection         With her husband, Siegfried, a banker and philanthropist who died in 1961, Mrs. Kramarsky owned an art collection that was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and included works by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Seurat and Gauguin.         Violet Ingeborg Else Popper was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of an importer who died in 1917. A twin brother was killed in action with the German Army in World War I. With her husband, whom she married in 1921, and children she left Germany in 1932, fleeing the rise of Hitler and anti-Semitism.         The Kramarskys came to the United States from the Netherlands in 1940, aided by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, a family friend who became the first president of Israel.         Mrs. Kramarsky is survived by two sons, Bernard, of Great Neck, L.I., and Werner, of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Sonia Kramarsky of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and three-great grandchildren.       
         Halina Rosenthal, a leader in promoting zoning laws and landmarks legislation throughout New York City, died yesterday afternoon at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her husband, the sculptor Tony Rosenthal, said.         Mrs. Rosenthal was president of the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic District, a preservationist group she helped found to monitor compliance after the district's 1981 designation by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.         This month, she was to receive the Doris C. Freedman award from Mayor David N. Dinkins. The award is given each year to the person who has done the most for the arts in the city. In February, she received the Historic Districts Council's 1991 Landmarks Lion Award in recognition of her efforts for preservation.  Born in Warsaw         Mrs. Rosenthal, a small friendly woman noted for her cordiality in the thick of debate, nevertheless described herself as a "hellion" when it came to pursuing measures she believed in. She worked to defeat plans for the expansion of the Whitney and the Guggenheim museums, and more recently opposed a proposal to place newsstands on Fifth Avenue.         Over the last 18 years, she supported landmark designation for scores of buildings. She also played an important role in zoning that prohibited structures of more than six stories on the midblocks between avenues outside the Upper East Side Historic District.         Mrs. Rosenthal was born in Warsaw and grew up in Cannes, where she spent her childhood at a Catholic convent. At the end of World War II, she met her husband, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, while attending a sculpture course he was teaching at an Army school in Biarritz in France.         Her interest in preservation began in 1973 upon the couple's purchase of a house on East 73d Street in Manhattan, when she founded the 73d Street Block Association for the purpose of planting trees.         A funeral will be held on Thursday at 11 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, at 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.       
         Teddy R. Zausner, the first president of the Manhattan chapter of Women's American O.R.T, or Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         She died of a brain tumor, a family spokesman said.         She was a longtime leader of the organization, a volunteer group that promotes higher education for Jews through 800 vocational schools and training centers in 35 countries.         Ms. Zausner, who was born in London and grew up in New York, graduated from New York University and worked as an X-ray technician at St. Luke's Hospital. In World War II, she was a member of the American Women's Voluntary Services, driving Navy personnel to ships and planes in the New York and New Jersey metropolitan region.         She is survived by two sons, Martin, of Manhattan, and Richard, of Sands Point, L.I.       
         Ruth Page, a pioneering American ballet dancer and one of the first ballet choreographers to employ American subject matter, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 92 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, said Andrew Mark Wentink, her biographer.         Miss Page, who arranged Rudolf Nureyev's New York debut by engaging him for one of the companies she directed, was involved with an almost bewildering array of activities. She performed with Anna Pavlova's classical ballet company, with Serge Diaghilev's avant-garde Ballets Russes and with German Expressionist modern dancers.         She appeared in opera houses around the world, danced at the coronation of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1928 and gave programs in the Soviet Union in 1930. But she remained proudly American, making Chicago the base of her activities and refusing to change her name at a time when many Americans adopted exotic stage names.  Wide Range as Choreographer         An eclectic choreographer, Miss Page is known for "Hear Ye, Hear Ye" (1934), a ballet about a murder trial to a commissioned score by Aaron Copland; "An American Pattern" (1937), a feminist protest against conformity; "Billy Sunday" (1948), a ballet derived from a fiery evangelist's sermons, and several ballets based on famous operas.         During the 30's, her partner was Bentley Stone, an American choreographer with whom she occasionally collaborated on works. Their most enduring achievement is "Frankie and Johnny," which was inspired by a bawdy old ballad about love and betrayal. Since its premiere in 1938, it has been successfully revived by many companies, including Dance Theater of Harlem. Reviewing a production by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1947, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, "It convinces you of its human truth even while you are chortling at its crude and uninhibited sentimentalities."         Miss Page was born in Indianapolis on March 22, 1899, the daughter of Dr. Lafayette Page, a brain surgeon, and Marian Heinly, a pianist. Her parents encouraged her desire to dance and sent her to study with local teachers. In 1914, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova was a guest at the Page house and was so impressed by Miss Page that she encouraged the teen-ager to make dancing her career. Miss Page appeared briefly with Pavlova's company that year.         Moving to Chicago, Miss Page studied with Adolph Bolm, a former member of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes who had settled in America and was staging productions both for Chicago companies and for his itinerant Ballet Intime. In 1919 Bolm choreographed "The Birthday of the Infanta" for Miss Page, one of the first 20th-century ballets with a score by an American composer (John Alden Carpenter) and scenery by an American designer (Robert Edmond Jones).  In a Stravinsky Premiere         Bolm and Miss Page again made history in 1928, when she portrayed Terpsichore in the world premiere of Stravinsky's "Apollo," choreographed by Bolm in Washington months before George Balanchine created his more familiar version of the ballet for Diaghilev.         Miss Page married Thomas Hart Fisher, a well-to-do Chicago lawyer, in 1925, and on her honeymoon in Europe danced with Diaghilev's company. While she was with the Ballets Russes, Balanchine choreographed two divertissements for her, "Etude" and "Polka Melancolique," which are believed to be his first works created for an American.         Always curious about dance forms, Miss Page studied with Mary Wigman, the great German Expressionist choreographer, in 1930. In 1933, she toured with another important German modern dancer, Harald Kreutzberg.         During the 1940's, she staged works in Chicago and for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She choreographed "Revanche," a ballet version of "Il Trovatore," for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees in Paris in 1951, and "Vilia," an adaptation of "The Merry Widow," for the London Festival Ballet in 1953. Their success prompted her to found the Chicago Opera Ballet in 1956, a touring company that featured ballets inspired by operas and operettas. Yet it also presented internationally known stars in classial excerpts. It was with this troupe that Mr. Nureyev made his New York City debut in 1962. Later known as Ruth Page's International Ballet, it continued until 1970.  An Annual 'Nutcracker'         In Chicago in 1965, Miss Page staged a production of "The Nutcracker" that remains an annual event in that city. She frequently revived her works for regional companies and directed the Ruth Page Foundation School of the Dance, which will continue under the direction of Larry Long.         Miss Page's first husband, Mr. Fisher, died in 1969. She married the French artist and stage designer Andre Delfau in 1983. Miss Page was the author of "Page by Page" (1980) and "Class" (1984). She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1980 and the Illinois Gubernatorial Award in 1985, and held honorary degrees from Indiana University, De Paul University and Columbia College of Chicago.         She is survived by her husband and a brother, Dr. Irvine Page of Hyannis, Mass.       
         Cora DuBois, an anthropologist, teacher and author who was an authority on Southeast Asia, died Sunday at a nursing home in Brookline, Mass. She was 87 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of pneumonia and heart failure, her secretary, Eric Davis, said.         Dr. DuBois was the Zimurray Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University and Radcliffe College when she retired in 1969. In World War II, she served with the Office of Strategic Services. She was later with the State Department, the Institute of International Education and the Far Eastern Association.         In 1938 Dr. DuBois, who had taught anthropology at Hunter College, went to live in Alor, a small island in the Dutch East Indies. Living alone in a house in a remote mountain village, she learned the local language and was able to win the confidence of villagers by giving simple medical aid. Study of Islanders         The result of her 18-month inquiry was "The People of Alor," a social and psychological study published in 1944 that won acclaim for its thoroughness and lucidity. She also wrote "Social Forces in Southeast Asia," which appeared in 1949, and her writings were widely published in scholarly journals.         Dr. DuBois was a graduate of Barnard College, where she worked under the anthropologists Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. She received her doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley after extensive ethnographic studies of Indian tribes in the American Northwest.         When she returned from Alor, Dr. DuBois tought at Sarah Lawrence College before joining the Office of Strategic Services in 1942 as chief of its Indonesia section. She later became chief of research and analysis for the Army's Southeast Asia Command.         The Army awarded Dr. DuBois the Exceptional Civilian Award, and she also received the Order of the Crown of Thailand for her participation in the Free Thai underground movement through the O.S.S. From 1945 to 1949 she was Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the State Department's Office of Intelligence Research.         In 1951 Dr. DuBois was named to direct a study of educational needs and resources of third world areas. In 1954 she was appointed director of the Far Eastern Association and at the same time returned to academic life with her appointment at Harvard and Radcliffe.         Dr. DuBois was president of the American Anthropological Associaton in 1968-69 and of the Association for Asian Studies in 1969-70.         She leaves no immediate family survivors. Her longtime companion was Jeanne Taylor.       
         Louise Dickinson Rich, the author of "We Took to the Woods," a best seller during World War II, died on Tuesday at her daughter's home in Mattapoisett, Mass. She was 87 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Dinah Anderson, said.         "We Took to the Woods" was a witty account of a Thoreau-like existence in a wilderness home in northwestern Maine.         Mrs. Rich was born in Huntington, Mass., and grew up in Bridgewater, where her father was the editor of a weekly newspaper. She met Ralph Eugene Rich, a Chicago businessman, on a Maine canoe trip in 1933 and they married a year later. Mr. Rich died in 1944.         Mrs. Rich wrote a number of books for adults and children, among them "Only Parent" (1953), "Innocence Under the Elms" (1955) and "The Coast of Maine" (1956).         She is survived, in addition to her daughter, by a son, Rufus, of Dresden, Me.; a sister, Alice D. Hoke of Mattepoisett, and a grandson.       
         Sarah Jane Kinoy, a teacher and social worker who was an early leader in the education of children with cerebral palsy, died on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 96 years old and had lived in Manhattan and Tompkins Corners, N.Y.         She died of heart failure, said her son Ernest.         Mrs. Kinoy, a graduate of Teachers College, was a social worker with the American Red Cross during World War I and later taught at the Brooklyn Ethical Culture School and at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         She was a founder of the Brooklyn Community School in the early 1940's and was executive director of the New York Service for Orthopedic Handicapped. At Teachers College she coordinated the special education department for children with cerebral palsy and in the 1950's, in cooperation with the New York City Board of Education, she developed a pilot school for Manhattan children with the disease. She later served as director of services for Cerebral Palsy of Queens.         She is survived by two sons, Ernest, a television writer, of Williamsville, Vt., and Arthur of Montclair, N.J., a Rutgers University law professor; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Martha Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of this century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Miss Graham died of cardiac arrest after being treated for two months for pneumonia, said Ron Protas, general director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Miss Graham had become ill in December after a 55-day tour of the Far East with her troupe. She entered the hospital on Jan. 15 and returned home two weeks ago.         Frequently ranked with Picasso, Stravinsky and James Joyce for developing a form of expression that broke the traditional mold, Miss Graham was initially acclaimed as a great dancer. Masterworks and Invention         Yet ultimately her genius -- universally recognized as she became the most honored figure in American dance -- was embodied in her choreographic masterworks and her invention of a new and codified dance language.         The Graham technique, which is now used by dance companies throughout the world, became the first enduring alternative to the idiom of classical ballet. Powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension, this vocabulary combined with Miss Graham's distinctive system of training to set her above other dance innovators.         Although such achievements were part of Miss Graham's multi-faceted pioneering role in helping to establish modern dance outside the older ballet tradition after the 1920's, she continued to amaze her public for more than 60 years. She choreographed more than 180 works. The most recent was her self-mocking "Maple Leaf Rag," which had its premiere on Oct. 2 with the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.         Throughout her career, Miss Graham's fundamental tenet was that dance should reach audiences through a visceral response rather than an objective image that registered upon the intellect. "Out of emotion comes form," she said, and then proved that out of form she could re-create the same emotion onstage.         She never wavered in her belief that movement could express inner feeling. Miss Graham sought to give "visible substance to things felt" and to "chart the graph of the heart." These celebrated Graham phrases became the metaphors central to her art.         Miss Graham's dances spoke elo- quently against the crushing of the human spirit, and one of her frequent themes was the condemnation of intolerance, especially toward nonconformists.         Her own life as a creative artist epitomized the independent spirit with which she so frequently imbued her dramatic heroines. The figure conquering sexual fear in "Errand Into the Maze," the woman looking deep into herself while preparing for an unnamed fate in "Herodiade" and the American pioneer brimming with optimism in "Frontier" could also be Clytemnestra or Jocasta, antiquity's queens who -- in the Graham canon -- emerged from crisis through the sheer force of self-understanding. Miss Graham usually cast herself at the center of these works until 1969, when she gave her last performance and retired reluctantly from the stage at the age of 75.         Because she rarely met conventional expectations about dance, she was both misunderstood and acclaimed. She was surrounded by debate throughout her career; few remained indifferent to her. Acknowledgment of Miss Graham's role as a dominant force in all the arts at first came from painters, writers, musicians and the acting profession. Gregory Peck and Bette Davis were among the many drama students she taught over the years at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Graham to perform at the White House in 1937, and in 1976 Miss Graham became the first dance personality to receive, from President Gerald R. Ford, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.         Nonetheless, Miss Graham's highly intense dancing and choreography were not intended to soothe the spirit and did not find ready acceptance. Quest for Inner Reality, But Never for Realism         Like Picasso, she was concerned with an inner reality. "For me, dance is theater," she wrote. But she never resorted to a realistic theater. More often than not, her choreography presented a dancer's body as distorted or dislocated, an assemblage of forms aligned into maximum expressiveness.         Audiences throughout the world were often disturbed by Miss Graham's frank acknowledgment of human sexuality, especially in her famous cycle inspired by Greek myths. Miss Graham's Medea, Jocasta, Phaedra and Clytemnestra gave vent to their lust and hate, baring the passions that few humans liked to recognize in themselves but that Miss Graham exposed with the unflinching scrutiny of a 20th-century Jungian analyst.         For Miss Graham, dance became a collective memory that could communicate the emotions universal to all civilizations: mythology, she felt, was the psychology of the ancients.         Miss Graham's encyclopedic approach to dance -- a creative wellspring from sources as varied as American Indian rituals to the Bible -- often carried several levels of meaning and startled a public that defined dance in linear or pictorial terms. Miss Graham, for her part, said she wanted her dances to be "felt" rather than comprehended in the usual manner.         In 1944, John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote of the emotional effect that the Graham dance theater could have upon the viewer. He warned that "Deaths and Entrances," the choreographer's study of turbulent passions inspired by Anne, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, the 19th-century English writers, was "un-understandable through the usual organs of understanding" and "slips in through sensory perceptions." The Graham Technique Is Based on Breathing         In general, Miss Graham saw art as a reflection of its time inseparable from life. "My dancing," she said, "is not an attempt to interpret life in the literary sense. It is an affirmation of life through movement."         Even the dance technique that she hammered out on her own body and then transferred to her school and company derived from the most organic aspect of human life: the act of breathing. That act was formalized and dramatized in the idiom's most basic principle, called contraction and release -- intensified moments of exhalation and inhalation. Miss Graham said her aim was "to increase the emotional activity of the dancer's body so that you are teaching the body, not teaching the mind."         The contraction, originating in the dancer's pelvis, created the percussive angular movement and sexual tension that invariably startled a newcomer to the Graham repertory. But it is the Graham idiom as a whole that can look strange to those who expect more of a continuum in dancing. Being 'the Thing Itself' Instead of Portraying It         Above all, she said, "Dance is not representational." Miss Graham recalled in later years that as a young dancer about to embark upon an independent career in 1922, she had chanced upon a nonfigurative painting by Wassily Kandinsky -- a slash of red against a field of blue. "I will dance like that," she said.         Like other modernists, Miss Graham rejected literal imagery in favor of abstraction. Form for form's sake, however, held no interest for her. Instead she focused on abstraction in its strict sense, that of extracting the essence of a quality of emotion. A celebrated example was "Lamentation," the 1930 solo in which Miss Graham, encased in a tube of stretch jersey, created sharply angular shapes on a bench. She did not dance about grief, but sought to be what she called "the thing itself" or the embodiment of grief.         Miss Graham's gift for the distilled image ranged over her entire career. In "Cave of the Heart" (1946), her Medea was the personification of hate, consumed by the venom of jealousy as visualized in snakelike contours.         The quintessential Graham could be found in "Frontier" (1935), one of the choreographer's pieces on overt American themes. The solo initiated her 32-year collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.         The set for "Frontier" was a fragment of a fence seemingly anchored by a rope behind. It had the same spareness and economy of Miss Graham's solo and the score of her music director and mentor of that time, Louis Horst. Noguchi noted in general that he had found in Miss Graham "a drive that motivated her to strip the dance to its stark rudiment." Noguchi's Sets Sought 'A Limitless Illusion'         Both artists shared an affinity for forms that looked abstract and were resonant with multiple meanings. Writing in 1984, Noguchi said that for "Frontier" he had "thought to catch the essential sculpture of space -- a limitless illusion." He continued: "This is the path I continued to investigate whenever Martha would call on me to rise to the occasion. She is the one who always came to me with her requirements and the myth she wished to encompass. My role was to respond."         Miss Graham's work revealed an integrated vision. She began using contemporary scores for the company she formed in 1929. After 1934, she tended to use commissioned music and was guided here by Horst, a composer who insisted that dance had a life independent of music and did not derive from it. Miss Graham herself, sometimes accused of using dance as mere aural decor, often said that she did not seek to interpret another art form -- that is, music.         Among the composers who wrote scores for Miss Graham were Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Aaron Copland, whose score for her 1944 classic, "Appalachian Spring," won the Pulitzer Prize.         Martha Graham, the eldest of three daughters, was born on May 11, 1894, in Allegheny, Pa., to George Graham, a physician who specialized in mental disorders, and the former Jane (Jenny) Beers, a descendant of Miles Standish. In 1908, the family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif. Started Dance Training At 22, After Father Died         In 1916, after the death of her father and after graduation from a junior college, the Cumnock School, Miss Graham enrolled in the Denishawn school in Los Angeles and then joined the Denishawn Company. Denishawn, organized by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, was then the only major dance company that worked outside the classical ballet tradition, and it became the incubating ground for such pioneering talents as Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Miss Graham herself.         John Murray Anderson saw Miss Graham with Denishawn and hired her for his Greenwich Village Follies in 1923 and 1924. But in those two years Miss Graham realized that neither Denishawn, with its exotic pretexts for dances, nor the commercial theater was right for her. At the invitation of Rouben Mamoulian, she joined the dance division of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she taught dance.         On April 18, 1926, she made her concert debut at the 48th Street Theater in New York with works that still showed the influence of Denishawn. "The idiom," the critic Robert Sabin recalled in 1953, "was still prevalently romantic and eclectic, but the spirit was new and as bracing as a salty sea wind."         Miss Graham taught in the early years in her studio at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 13th Street, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She assembled a company of women. Because the members had to support themselves, they would work on new works for nine months, then give a few recitals in New York and go on tour.         From her group, augmented by men in 1938 to 1939, came the next generation of modern dancers, choreographers and teachers: Anna Sokolow, Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, May O'Donnell, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham and later Paul Taylor and John Butler. Miss Graham, who had a long-term relationship with Horst, was married in 1948 to Mr. Hawkins. They separated in the early 1950's and were later divorced. Received Financial Help From Many Individuals         Before World War II, Miss Graham took on outside assignments. In 1930, she was the Chosen One in Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski and choreographed by Leonide Massine. A few years later she collaborated on dramatic productions with Blanche Yurka, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, and Archibald MacLeish.         Troubled by the recurring financial problems that were endemic to an art form struggling for acceptance, Miss Graham was helped over the years by individual patrons. Among them were Frances Steloff, founder of the Gotham Book Mart, whose $1,000 loan made the initial 1926 concert possible, Miss Cornell, Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace and, most recently, Halston. Mrs. Wallace made it possible for the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance to acquire the building at 316 East 63d Street, where the Graham school is situated.         In the early years, Miss Graham costumed herself and the women in her troupe in stretch jersey. She later referred to this time as her "long woolens" period. Her dances were spare and stark, testimony to her deep interest in ritual, and she was strongly influenced by the ceremonial Indian dances she had witnessed in the Southwest. These experiences were reflected in such works as "Primitive Mysteries" and "El Penitente," which remain in her company's repertory. From American Themes To Ancient Mythology         In the 1930's, Miss Graham was known for her American themes. "We must look to America to bring forth an art as powerful as America itself," she said, and produced such works as "American Document," "American Provincials," "Appalachian Spring," "Letter to the World" and "Salem Shore."         After 1946, she immersed herself in Hebrew and Greek mythology with "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey," "Errand Into the Maze," "Judith," "The Witch of Endor," "Phaedra" and, most powerfully, the full-evening "Clytemnestra" of 1958. She picked up historical personages with legendary qualities, the Bronte sisters for "Deaths and Entrances" and Joan of Arc for "Seraphic Dialogue."         As the years progressed, Miss Graham was loath to leave the stage. Since she was the central figure on that stage, she eventually began to create roles for herself that were less physically demanding. After her retirement from dancing, her new works rarely focused on a protagonist.         Repeatedly acclaimed as a choreographer, she always considered herself a dancer first. After relinquishing her roles to younger dancers, she continued to direct her company. She made triumphant tours to the Far East and Europe under Government auspices and, in her 80's and 90's, increasingly traveled abroad with her company. Her tour last fall took in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Congressional Propriety Offended by 'Phaedra'         It was on a European trip in 1962 that she ran afoul of two United States Representatives, Edna Kelly of Brooklyn and Peter Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. They saw "Phaedra" in Bonn and, apparently not knowing the Greek legend of a queen's passion for her stepson, protested that the work was too explicit to be a proper cultural export for the United States.         Although Miss Graham was identified with a new art form that initially rejected classical ballet as being inadequate for contemporary expression, she collaborated with ballet's leading personalities.         In 1959, the New York City Ballet presented "Episodes," consisting of two sections to Webern's music. George Balanchine choreographed one half and Miss Graham the other. In 1975, just before Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev appeared as guests in her company, she declared, "The war has ended," alluding to the perceived conflict between modern dance and ballet. Further proof came when Mikhail Baryshnikov appeared as a guest with her troupe from 1987 to 1989.         Among Miss Graham's awards were the first Guggenheim Fellowship given to a dancer; the Kennedy Center Honors; the Aspen Award in the Humanities; the Capezio Dance Award; the first Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award to honor achievement in modern dance; the Meadows Award in the performing arts; the Handel Medallion of New York City; the Henry Hadley medal for contribution to American music, and the first National Medal of Arts.         In 1987, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave Miss Graham the Ingenio et Arti medal, a rarely awarded honor and her country's highest distinction for contributions to the arts and sciences. Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, personally decorated her in 1984 with the Legion of Honor at the Paris Opera. She received a number of honorary degrees, from Yale, Harvard and other universities.         Miss Graham liked to emphasize that her work and private life were separate. "I have always fought against any dramatization of my peculiarities or my personality," she said. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Lask noted it was through her work "that she had, in William Faulkner's apt phrase, put a scratch on the face of eternity."         Martha Graham was living proof of her own adage: "No artist is ahead of his time. He         is         his time; it is just that others are behind the time."         Miss Graham leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Lisa Taylor, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design from 1969 to 1987, died on Friday in a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas, said David McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts. She was 58 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mr. McFadden said she died of liver cancer.         The museum's current director, Dianne Pilgrim, said through a spokesman that Mrs. Taylor "had a passionate belief in the importance of design and brought that passion and excitement to the museum."         The museum, in the former Andrew Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st Street, is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It closed in 1963 but reopened in 1976, after Mrs. Taylor played a major role in raising funds to install it in the renovated mansion.         Grace Glueck, The New York Times critic, wrote in 1976, "The museum's far-reaching collection covers 3,000 years of artistic production, but it is also very much in touch with contemporary concerns, such as urban planning and the environment." 'Wallpaper to Bird Cages'         What is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum originated as a part of Cooper Union, which had housed it since 1897. In the 1960's, financial problems led Cooper Union to end its ties with the museum, which by then was what Paul Goldberger, The Times critic, called "one of the world's finest storehouses of objects of design and the decorative arts -- with everything from collections of wallpaper to bird cages."         In 1969, the secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, named her as head of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1972 the Carnegie Corporation donated the mansion, and over the next four years Mrs. Taylor and her staff managed to obtain more than $6 million from private individuals, corporations and foundations.         It was Mrs. Taylor who had the idea for the annual Museum Mile open house and street fair involving museums along upper Fifth Avenue. It was first held in 1979, and 10 museums participated last year.         In 1976, Mrs. Taylor said, "I think we'll be a great success, because we have a superb collection and people are becoming more and more aware of how design relates to the quality of life. And besides, there's a feeling of love for us because we've made it." Edited Design Series         Mr. McFadden said Mrs. Taylor retired in 1987 for reasons of health and to work on the final volumes in a series of books she edited. The series, titled "Immovable Objects," comprises six books of essays by various authorities on the impact of design on daily life. The volumes have separate topics ranging from urban open spaces to the subways.         Mrs. Taylor was born on Jan. 8, 1933, in New York, the daughter of Theo von Bergen-Maier, an architect, and the former Martina Weincerl, a painter.         She studied at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington and at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities.         She was on the staff of the President's Fine Arts Commission in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and membership director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington from 1962 to 1966. She then joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where she helped to devise a highly successful Smithsonian educational program before being named to head the Cooper Union Museum.         She was awarded honorary doctorates by the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.         She is survived by her second husband, Bertrand L. Taylor 3d, who is an investor; their daughter, Lauren, and their son, Lindsay, all of Naples, Fla.

         Kathryn Teaze, a Red Cross volunteer whose more than 70 years of service spanned two world wars, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Fairfield, Conn. She was 93 years old and lived in Weston, Conn.         She died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.         Her mother started the Red Cross chapter in her hometown of Bloomfield, N.J. Mrs. Teaze's late husband, Moses, was president of the chapter and of the Westport-Weston chapter after the couple moved to Connecticut in 1950.         She joined the Red Cross at the age of 18, shortly after the start of World War I, and became captain of the motor corps for the chapter in Bloomfield. During the 1920's and 1930's, she continued to transport soldiers to and from hospitals. When World War II began, she became co-captain of the Red Cross Motor Corps. In the 1950's she began helping drives for the newly established Red Cross blood bank. She ceased her volunteer activities in mid-1990.         She is survived by two sons, Allison D., of Little Falls, N.J., and David A., of New Canaan, Conn.; a daughter, Kathryn Clark of Weston; 9 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Nettie S. Horch, an arts patron and co-founder of the Master Institute of United Arts in New York City, died at the Humana-Biscayne Hospital in North Miami on Monday. She was 94 years old and lived in Hallandale, Fla.         She died of bronchitis, her daughter, Oriole Farb Feshbach, said.         The Master Institute, which began as a music school with a collection of Old Master art works, was founded by Mrs. Horch in 1922 with her husband, Louis. Its purpose was to help bring people together through the arts.         In 1928 the Horches incorporated quarters for the Institute in a 29-story residential skyscraper they built at Riverside Drive and 103d Street. Their aim was to provide an environment of art and culture for apartment dwellers, and they developed the concept that income from the apartments would support the art activities of the Institute. The building contained a 300-seat theater, a non-profit school of fine arts, studio apartments for musicians and dancers, and the Riverside Museum, a small, vanguard institution that became known for showing work that differed from the prevailing currents in the art world.  Equality in Acquisitions         Mrs. Horch became the director of the museum, which not only housed the couple's collection of Tibetan, American, and American Indian art, but mounted many early shows by artists who were later to become well-known, like Louise Nevelson. The museumdevoted a number of shows to the work of women, and under Mrs. Horch's direction, presented in 1939 the first exhibition by the Abstract American Artists, whose work ran against the social realist trend of the time. The museum also gave shows to the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. In 1940 it mounted one of the earliest exhibitions of work by Puerto Rican artists.         As fine arts chairman of the National Council of Women of the United States, from 1937 to 1954, Mrs. Horch was interested in fostering the work of women artists, and mounted a series of group shows devoted to women of various nationalities, among them Japanese, Canadian and Norwegian.         In 1971, after Mrs. Horch and her husband moved to Florida, the museum was closed, and its holdings became the Louis and Nettie Horch Collection at Brandeis University. Mr. Horch died in 1979.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Leonia, N.J. and Amherst, Mass., Mrs. Horch is survived by a brother, Nathan Stone of Lake Worth, Fla., four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Clara Leiser, founder of Youth of All Nations, a nonprofit peace organization that grew out of her experience with refugee children in World War II, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her niece, Anita Leiser, with whom she lived.         Miss Leiser began her career as assistant editor and advertising manager of The Wisconsin Journal of Education. In the late 1920's she resigned to take what was to be the first of many trips to Europe in the 1930's.         Moved by events she had witnessed during the rise of Nazism, she sought to ease the adjustment of hundreds of teen-age refugees from fascism, asking them what they missed most. Nearly all answered "friends."         The result, in 1944, was Youth of All Nations, devoted to building understanding among the youth of many countries, races and religious beliefs through a correspondence program.         To show how letters could improve international understanding, Miss Leiser would cite correspondence from a young German boy whose letters revealed his gradual understanding of democratic ideals.         She wrote or edited several books, among them "Skeleton of Justice," with Edith Roper (E.P. Dutton, 1941); "Lunacy Becomes Us," quotations from Hitler and other top Nazis (Liveright, 1939); "Jean de Reszke and the Great Days of Opera" (Minton, Balch, 1934).         A native of Milwaukee, Miss Leiser was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a sister, Gertrude B. Wilde of Milwaukee.       
         Ilse Koehn, a writer and graphic artist, died on May 8 at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 61 years old.         Ms. Koehn died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.         She moved to New York City from West Berlin in 1958 and worked as an art director for the J. Walter Thompson and Campbell-Downe advertising agencies. After she moved to Greenwich in 1970, she and her husband, John Van Zwienen, worked together as writers, illustrators and graphic designers. The couple later divorced.         Ms. Koehn's first book, "Mischling, Second Degree," described her experiences as a child of part-Jewish parentage growing up in Berlin under the Nazis and in evacuation camps during World War II.  The book was published in six countries outside the United States, including Britain, France and West Germany. It received the Boston Globe Hornbook Award, the Jane Addams Peace Foundation Award for nonfiction and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award as a book recommended for young readers.         Ms. Koehn was a member of the Graphic Artists Guild and the Authors Guild.         She is survived by a stepdaughter, Kyle Van Zwienen of Webster, Mass.       
         Twila Lytton Cavert, an educator who was an early advocate of higher status for women in church affairs, died on Tuesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 96 years old.         After World War II, Mrs. Cavert directed a two-year study of women in churches in 54 countries. She was chairwoman of the resulting International Conference of Church Women in Baarn, the Netherlands, in 1948. This preceded the meeting in Amsterdam of the First Assembly of the World Council of Churches, which recommended that churches give a full range of responsibilities to women.         Mrs. Cavert received a bachelor's degree in 1915 at Ohio Weselyan University and a master's at Columbia University, She taught social studies at Ohio Wesleyan, at Women's Union College in Tokyo, Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., and Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville. She was a director of the Young Women's Christian Association from 1928 to 1944. In 1941 she became a director of the United Council of Church Women.         In the 1930's she was a trustee of the Women's College of Yenching University at Beijing, and of Mount Holyoke College.         Her husband, Samuel McCrea Cavert, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, died in 1976. She is survived by a stepdaughter, Mary Cavert Ramsey of Santee, S.C.; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ana Cristina Bozzo, an art teacher at Hunter College High School who spent the last decade organizing the International Art Show for the End of World Hunger, died Monday at Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Alexandra Poe, a board member of Artists to End Hunger Inc., the corporation that presented the show.         Working in her living room at night, on weekends and on vacations, Ms. Bozzo, who was born in Buenos Aires, assembled the show by asking noted artists to donate or lend works that represented their vision of a world without hunger.         She ended up with 46 pieces by artists including Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Marisol and Robert Rauschenberg. The exhibition toured 18 cities around the world, starting with a preview in Washington in 1986 and ending in March at El Museo del Barrio in New York City.         The show was not intended to raise money; its goal was to spread the message that the earth has abundant resources to feed everyone. But with Ms. Bozzo's encouragement, local organizations used the show as an opportunity to raise money and educate people about hunger. Ms. Bozzo also inspired students at Hunter to raise money for hunger relief.         Twenty of the works from the show are being auctioned by Sotheby's, and five are to be offered for private sale. Ms. Poe said they are expected to raise about $500,000. Proceeds will be given to the relief organizations God's Love We Deliver, City Harvest, Manos Unidas and Save the Children.         Ms. Bozzo is survived by her husband, Rogelio Chomnalez of Manhattan, and her parents, Manuel and Dora, and a brother, Carlos Antonio, all of Buenos Aires.       
         Goldie Bober Kweller, the president of Mercaz, the Zionist organization of the Conservative movement, died on Sunday at her home in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens. She was 70 years old.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Kweller, a native of Brooklyn, was national president of the Women's League for Conservative Judaism from 1978 to 1982. At her death, she was the chairwoman of the league's field service and of its long-range planning committee.         She was a member of the board of overseers of the Jewish Theological Seminary and the board of directors of the United Synagogue of America, vice president of the World Council of Synagogues and secretary of the national association of Solomon Schechter Day Schools.         In 1979 she received the community leadership award of the Jewish Theological Seminary and in 1986 she received the seminary's Solomon Schechter Medal for service in the field of Jewish education.         Mrs. Kweller is survived by her husband, Murry; two sons, Bruce, of Queens, and David, of Jackson, Miss.; a sister, Gert Mass Unger of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and six grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Jay Hollins, an author who wrote under the name Elizabeth Etnier, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hollins wrote "On Gilbert Head," a critically praised journal of her life in the 1930's with her first husband, the painter Stephen Etnier, on an island in Maine.         The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1948 she married Harry B. Hollins. She published short stories and a novella, and in 1966 she edited "Peace Is Possible: A Reader on World Order." Achieving world peace was a cause for which she worked closely with Mr. Hollins, who died in March.         She was born in New York and graduated from Barnard College.         She is survived by two daughters, Stephanie Doane and Victoria Villamil; a stepson, Harry Hollins; four stepdaughters, Elizabeth Aldrich, Lilias Outerbridge, Evelina Kats and Angelica Braestrup; a brother, Peter Jay; three sisters, Sybil Waldron, Augusta Huffman and Katharine Bacon, and four grandchildren.         A memorial service is to be held at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, at 4 P.M. on Thursday.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Jean Arthur, the buoyant actress whose piquant charm and infectious laughter enriched some of the finest comedy dramas of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at the Carmel Convalescent Hospital in Carmel, Calif., where she lived for 35 years. She was 90 years old.         Miss Arthur died of a heart ailment, a family spokeswoman said.         Miss Arthur had a bubbly flair for reflecting the absurdities of life, a subtle vulnerability and a voice that wavered unpredictably between the spunky and the amiable.         The classic films she graced included three by Frank Capra -- "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" -- and also George Stevens's "More the Merrier" and Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair."  A Marshmallow Heart         Miss Arthur's winsome talent was brightest in roles where her hard-boiled career woman's exterior masked a marshmallow heart, as when she first exploited and then inspired such country bumpkins as Gary Cooper as Mr. Deeds and James Stewart as Mr. Smith in their uphill challenges to greed and corruption.         The actress's honesty made even implausible scenes and films appear credible. A shy perfectionist, she was invariably self-critical of her performances, refused to pose for cheesecake photographs, rarely granted interviews and was often suspended by Columbia Pictures for rejecting roles. "I just couldn't act in a bad picture," she once said.         She began acting on the Broadway stage and returned in 1950 for a widely praised performance in the title role of "Peter Pan," Sir James M. Barrie's 1904 fantasy about the lad who refused to grow up. The production had 321 performances, one of the longest runs for the classic. Interpreting 'Peter Pan'         The hit prompted Miss Arthur to drop her guard and give an interviewer this interpretation of the theme: "Peter represents the youth in all of us: the freshness and originality of childhood before our parents and schoolteachers have pressed us into a mold. Barrie meant that we should not let that 'genius of childhood' escape us, not let our neighbors and the man at the corner grocery store do our thinking for us. If I can get over the message that we should all try to be ourselves, to be free individuals, then I'm sure I'll have accomplished what Barrie wanted."         The actress, who was originally named Gladys Georgianna Greene, was born on Oct. 17, 1900, in Plattsburg, N.Y., and grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Her father was a photographer. When pressed by Hollywood to choose a stage name, she selected one honoring two idols: Jeanne d'Arc and King Arthur.         She attended George Washington High School and soon became a successful advertising model, which led to a movie test and contract. She acted in dozens of silent two-reel comedies, melodramas and westerns. Easily making the transition to sound, she played ingenues in a spate of comedies, adventure yarns and melodramas. In three of them, she had to cope wih the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (played by Warner Oland).  Back to Hollywood         But unhappy with her roles and determined to master her art, Miss Arthur returned to New York in the early 1930's and acted for several years on the summer theater circuit and Broadway in a total of 14 plays. Most were flops, but critics began to laud her maturing talent.         She won a contract with Columbia Pictures, returned to Hollywood and her comic talents blossomed in "The Whole Town's Talking," a 1935 gangster yarn of mistaken identity.         Miss Arthur credited Frank Capra with nurturing her skill in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). In the first comedy, playing a reporter, she humiliates a naive well-meaning heir -- played by Mr. Cooper -- and then saves him from his greedy tormentors at a sanity hearing. In "Mr. Smith," as a secretary, she deceives an artless young senator (Mr. Stewart), but later uses her parliamentary expertise to aid his filibuster and defeat his foes.         Other comedy successes included "Easy Living," "You Can't Take It With You," "The Devil and Miss Jones," "The Talk of the Town," "The More the Merrier," in which she, with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, wrestled with the housing shortage in World War II Washington, and "A Foreign Affair." She was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in "More the Merrier."         The actress also won plaudits for roles in such films as "Diamond Jim," "The Plainsman," "History Is Made at Night," "Only Angels Have Wings," "Arizona" and later, in 1953, in "Shane," about the disturbing effect of a gunfighter (Alan Ladd) on a frontier family, with Miss Arthur playing a gentle and loyal wife and mother.         At the peak of her career, in the mid- 1940's, she began studying many liberal-arts subjects at colleges. "All my life," she said, "I've wanted to make enough money so I could stop and be a student for a while. The only real reason for living is doing what you want to do, or trying to, anyway." Years later, she taught acting at Vassar College.         Her later stage appearances were frustrated by directorial and cast disputes and illnesses. On television, she played an urbane lawyer in "The Jean Arthur Show" in 1966, but the scripts were more far-fetched than funny.         Her elusiveness led to contrasting stories about her self-doubts and later psychoanalysis with Dr. Erich Fromm. In 1972, she remarked, "I guess I became an actress because I didn't want to be myself."         Miss Arthur was married twice, to Julian Anker, a photographer, in 1928, and to Frank Ross, a producer, from 1932 to 1949. Both marriages ended in divorce.         In later decades, she spent most of her time at her coastal retreat in Carmel, where she once remarked, "I have a very good life" with some good friends, a brood of cats and "the sea on three sides of me."         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Lorraine Walters Katz, a retired owner of a children's clothing store in Deal, N.J., died on Monday at Riverview Hospital in Red Bank, N.J. She was 66 years old and lived in Deal.         She died of lymphoma, her husband said.         From 1960 to 1980, she owned and operated Young World.         Mrs. Katz was born in Asbury Park, N.J., and was a graduate of the University of Miami. She was a member of the first women's advisory board for First Merchants Bank, now Midlantic National Bank, in Asbury Park in 1970.         She is survived by her husband, Stanley R. Katz, the mayor of Deal; four sons, Richard, of West Long Branch, N.J., Steven, of Livingston, N.J., Robert, of Minneapolis, and Jonathan, of Tucson, Ariz.; a sister, Helen Rosengarten of Monmouth Beach, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Margaret L. Suckley, an aide and confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and an archivist at the nation's first Presidential Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., died on Saturday at Wilderstein, her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 99 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Miss Suckley, who was known as Daisy, was a distant cousin and close neighbor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and lived her entire life in the landmark house overlooking the Hudson River near Hyde Park built by her grandfather in 1852.         In 1940, Miss Suckley, who raised Scottish terriers, gave the President a puppy he named Fala. The dog soon became the country's most photographed animal. Miss Suckley was the co-author of a children's book about Fala and took part in producing two short films depicting the dog's life in the limelight. Center of Political Uproar         Fala became the center of a political uproar in the 1944 Presidential campaign, when Republicans charged that the Navy had sent a warship to rescue the dog after he had been left behind during a visit by President Roosevelt to the Aleutian Islands. The President turned the story to his advantage by expressing mock indignation that his Republican adversaries would attack "even my little dog Fala."         Miss Suckley was largely invisible to the general public although she traveled with the President on wartime inspection trips and to meetings with heads of state and allied military leaders. She was at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga., when President Roosevelt suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945.         She continued on the staff of the Roosevelt Library until she retired in 1963. She often spoke about the Roosevelt Presidency from her privileged station close to the family but was unassuming and meticulously factual and circumspect in her recollections. Nurse's Aide During War         Miss Suckley was born at Wilderstein and was a descendant of several prominent American families of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Livingstons and Beekmans. She attended Bryn Mawr and during World War I served as a nurse's aide at a military hospital on Ellis Island.         In 1980, she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation, dedicated to the maintenance and public enjoyment of her 45-acre riverfront property whose grounds were designed by Calvert Vaux, the noted 19th century park architect, and whose Queen Anne interiors were the work of J. B. Tiffany. Last year Wilderstein received National Historic Landmark status.         Miss Suckley, the last of seven brothers and sisters, is survived by two nieces, Margaret Hendrick of Annapolis, Md., and Catherine Hambley of Rhinebeck.       
         Anita Hart Balter, an artist and writer well known for her role in fostering the arts in the Hudson Valley, died on June 29 at her home in Garrison, N.Y.         Mrs. Balter, who was 57 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., died of complications from breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Her activities were directed at both art and broader community development. She was the founder and operator of Gallery Forecast, now defunct, in Peekskill, in which well-known sculptors chose emerging talent for exhibition to draw the attention of the many corporate headquarters in the region.         Mrs. Balter, who was born in Amsterdam and moved to the United States with her family just before World War II, was also on the board of the Garrison Art Center, where she established a Scholarship and Mentor Program in which artists worked with promising local pupils. In 1987 she was a founding board member of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival.         She is survived by her husband, Lee; her mother, Jenny Hart; a brother, Herbert Hart of Monte Carlo, Monaco; and, by a former marriage, a daughter, Elise Hart of Berkeley, Calif., and two sons, Michael Sheffrin of Majorca, and Ivan Sheffrin of Washington, and a grandson.       
         Maria Fisher, founder of the Beethoven Society of America and the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, died on Thursday at her home in Washington. She was 87 years old.         She died of brain cancer, said Tom Carter, the director of the institute.         Born in Wittenberg, Germany, Mrs. Fisher, whose family name was Wollenweber, lived in England before moving to the United States in 1945. She was an actress who appeared in more than 60 movies and a soprano with the London Opera Company and, under the name Maria de la Hull, with the Columbia Opera Company in Washington.         After her marriage to Clarence Milton Fisher, a patent lawyer, in 1955, Mrs. Fisher became a philanthropist. Mr. Fisher died in 1965.         In 1963 she founded the American Opera School, which awarded scholarships to aspiring singers. Eleven years later, she organized the Beethoven Society of America, presenting classical concerts at low prices. She also established annual piano competitions and music scholarships for teen-agers.         Mrs. Fisher founded the Thelonious Monk Institute in 1986 with the aim of creating the world's first music conservatory devoted solely to jazz. The school is scheduled to open in 1993.         Mrs. Fisher was also a contributor to and a fund-raiser for the Gallaudet College for the Deaf in Washington. She recently had become involved in the effort to expand research and medical programs for pediatric AIDS.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Armina Marshall, an actress, a playwright and a co-administrator of the Theater Guild whose career on Broadway spanned more than half a century, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Philip Langner.         For nearly four decades beginning in the early 1920's, Miss Marshall, together with her husband, Lawrence Langner, and Theresa Helburn, co-founders of the Theater Guild, guided the subscription company through its glory years as one of the most successful producers of Broadway plays.         Miss Marshall and Mr. Langner, who had been married 37 years when he died in 1962, were the co-authors of seven plays, three of which made it to Broadway, including the 1933 hit "Pursuit of Happiness."         Miss Marshall, who was part American Indian, was born on the Cherokee Strip in what was then the Oklahoma Territory and spent her early school years in Pawnee, where her father was the sheriff. The family moved to the West Coast, and she attended the University of California at Los Angeles and taught school in Brawley, Calif., while playing small parts at local theaters.         She moved to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and in 1922 was introduced to Mr. Langner, a patent lawyer.         Miss Marshall was accepted into the Theater Guild and acted in several plays in succeeding years. In 1925 she and Mr. Langner were married. With Miss Helburn, a drama critic and director, the Langners built the Theater Guild into a Broadway powerhouse that by the time of Miss Helburn's death in 1959 had produced 190 attractions in New York City, in nine other cities across the country and in London.         The guild brought dozens of memorable productions to Broadway. Perhaps the most celebrated was "Oklahoma!" in 1943. The show, which blended narrative and song with ballet, transformed American musical theater almost overnight.         Among the outstanding playwrights whose work the guild produced were George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O'Neill, S. N. Behrman, Robert Sherwood and Maxwell Anderson. Actors who were guild regulars ranged from James O'Neill, Eugene's father, to Eva Le Gallienne, Claudette Colbert, Humphrey Bogart, Judith Anderson, Shirley Booth and Judy Holliday. Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne acted together in 19 guild-produced plays, Mr. Lunt alone in 4 others and Miss Fontanne alone in 2.         Miss Marshall was the associate director of "Theater Guild of the Air" for its eight-year run on radio and of "The U.S. Steel Hour" for eight years on television.         Miss Marshall's theatrical interests extended well beyond the guild. In World War II she was a founder of the Stage Door Canteen in Washington. She was also a founder of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., and a director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Fund, with which she was active until five years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Miss Marshall is survived by two granddaughters.         Correction:  July 23, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary headline yesterday about Armina Marshall, an actress and playwright, misstated her connection with the Theater Guild. She was a co-administrator, not a co- founder.       
         Elaine P. Halperin, a translator and editor, died on Sunday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son, David.         Mrs. Halperin's first major work of translation was Francis Ambriere's "Long Holiday," a World War II prison camp memoir published in 1948. She translated several other works of fiction and nonfiction from French into English, including Michael Bernanos's 1968 novel, "The Other Side of the Mountain," which won her the Scott Moncrieff Award for distinguished translation. She also translated "Jean Monnet and the United States of Europe" (1969) and "The Duel: De Gaulle and Pompidou" (1972).         Mrs. Halperin's husband, S. William Halperin, died in 1979. In addition to her son David, a professor of literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she is survived by another son, John, Centennial Professor of English at Vanderbilt University.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Dr. Florence B. Seibert, who invented the first reliable tuberculosis test and helped improve the safety of intravenous injections, died on Aug. 23 at the Palm Springs Nursing Home in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed. Teresa Hicks, an aide who helped care for Dr. Seibert at the home, said she had been in declining health in the last two years and suffered from complications from childhood polio.         For her pioneering research Dr. Seibert was inducted last year into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y.         She was born in Easton, Pa., and was stricken by polio at the age of 3. Forced to wear braces, she turned to academic pursuits because, she later recalled, "I couldn't go out and dance and play" like other children. Academic and Medical Achievements         She graduated at the top of her high school class and won a scholarship to Goucher College in Maryland. After graduating she worked as a chemist in a paper mill in World War I. She then won a scholarshipto Yale University, where she earned a Ph.D.         While studying at Yale she discovered that some bacteria managed to survive existing distillation methods. Contaminated distilled water, when used for intravenous injections, often caused fever in patients. Dr. Seibert devised a simpler and better distillation process that eliminated the germs, making injections safer.         A Guggenheim Fellowship led her to Uppsala University in Sweden and her best-known discovery. She devised a method for isolating tuberculosis protein molecules, then used the material to develop a skin reaction test for tuberculosis infection.         The test was adopted as the standard by the United States in 1941 and by the World Health Organization in 1952, and is still in use today. A Public Health Consultant         During her career Dr. Seibert taught and did research at the University of Chicago and the Sprague Institute in Chicago, and at the Henry Phipps Institute of the University of Pennsylvania. She was also a consultant to the United States Public Health Service.         Dr. Seibert wrote many articles for scientific journals, and held five honorary degrees. Even after she retired in Florida, Dr. Seibert conducted research on cancer.         She is survived by a younger sister, Mabel, of St. Petersburg, who assisted in Dr. Seibert's research and lived with her.       
         Laura Riding Jackson, a poet, critic and co-founder with Robert Graves of various literary publishing ventures, died on Monday at the Humana Sebastian Hospital in Sebastian, Fla. She was 90 years old and had lived in Florida since 1938.         She died of cardiac arrest, said Theodore Wilentz, a close friend.         Born in New York City and originally named Laura Reichenthal, Miss Riding established herself as an important avant-garde poet in the early 1920's, when she attracted the attention of the Fugitives, a group of American Southern writers centered at Vanderbilt University. Members of the group included John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren.         In 1923, their magazine, The Fugitive, commended Miss Riding's first published poem for its originality, and in 1923 hailed her work as "the discovery of the year."         In praising her poetry, the critic Paul Auster wrote that "in poem after poem, we witness her trying somehow to peel back the skin of the world in order to find some absolute and unassailable place of permanence."         Later, Miss Riding joined the English poet and novelist Robert Graves, with whom she lived during the 1920's and 30's, as co-founder of a small literary publishing firm called Sezin Press, which lasted from 1927 to 1938. She and Mr. Graves also edited Epilogue, a series of volumes of criticism that contributed to a school of thought that became known as The New Criticism.         In 1938, she married Schulyer B. Jackson, the critic and former poetry editor of Time magazine, and settled in Florida. She renounced poetry at that time, "as imposing irremovable obstacles to the realizing of the full potential afforded by language."         Both because of her devotion to language and defiance of all social instituitions, the critic Martin Green once wrote, Ms. Riding became "a hero for all poets and other rebels."       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.

         Olga Spessivtzeva, a Russian ballerina whose dancing was praised for its Romantic purity and spiritual radiance, died on Monday at Nyack (N.Y.) Hospital. She was 96 years old and lived at the Tolstoy Foundation Nursing Home in Valley Cottage, N.Y.         She died of pneumonia, said Elizabeth Lopukhin, a social worker at the nursing home.         Miss Spessivtzeva was acclaimed by critics in the 1920's and 30's as one of this century's most eloquent interpreters of "Giselle." In later years, her life was often compared to that of the ballet's tragic heroine. Just as Giselle, a frail, melancholy young woman, succumbs to madness in the ballet, so Miss Spessivtzeva had a series of mental breakdowns that ended her career.         At the height of her performing powers, she was said to have been magical onstage. Anton Dolin, a former partner who became her biographer, once declared: "The quality of beauty she produced caused the heart to miss a beat. She had a calm, glowing integrity, a serenely devotional approach to her work."         Miss Spessivtzeva was born in Rostov, Russia, and was trained at the Imperial Ballet School of St. Petersburg. After her graduation in 1913, she joined the Maryinsky (now the Kirov) Ballet and, despite a bout with tuberculosis, continued to dance during the 1920's in western Europe with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Diaghilev had long admired the ballerina Anna Pavlova, but he said, "My astonishment was then unbounded when I met Spessivtzeva, a creature finer and even purer than Pavlova." As choreographer for the Diaghilev company, George Balanchine created the title role of "La Chatte" for Miss Spessiv tzeva in 1927. Last Performance in 1937         The ballerina, who occasionally shortened her name to Spessiva, also appeared with the Paris Opera Ballet, the Colon ballet in Buenos Aires and the Camargo Society, a London organization that was one of the forerunners of the Royal Ballet.         While touring the world in the mid-1930's with the Victor Dandre-Alexander Levitov Ballet, the successor to Pavlova's company, Miss Spessivtzeva began to suffer from increasingly serious breakdowns. She gave her last performance in 1937 and settled in New York the next year. She was hospitalized from 1943 to 1963, when, with the aid of several friends, including Mr. Dolin, she was able to move to the Tolstoy Foundation.         There she led a quiet life. Her health improved, and members of the dance world occasionally visited her. Gerald Arpino, who choreographed a tribute to her, "L'Air d'Esprit," for the Joffrey Ballet in 1978, recalled in an interview: "She had this fragile, unworldly quality. She seemed to transcend time."         There are no immediate survivors. A memorial service is to be held at 11 A.M. tomorrow at St. Sergius Chapel in Valley Cottage.       
         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Hallie Burnett Zeisel, a novelist, college teacher and co-editor of Story magazine from 1942 to 1971, died on Wednesday at the Steward Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 years old.         She died of causes related to a stroke she suffered two years ago, said her daughter, Whitney Voss.         The novelist, who was professionally known as Hallie Burnett, made her reputation as a nurturer of young talent at Story magazine.         She joined the periodical in 1942 as assistant editor and new wife of its editor and founder, Whitney Ewing Burnett. Through the 1940's and 1950's, Story published known and unknown writers alike, paying the same standard fees. Salinger, Cheever, Etc.         During her tenure, Mrs. Burnett helped publish the early short stories of writers like J. D. Salinger, John Cheever and William Saroyan.         Then there was the young soldier named Joseph Heller who entered a writing contest held by the magazine. And there were stories from Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. A Harvard freshman named Norman Mailer won a Story college-writing prize for a piece entitled "The Greatest Thing in the World."         In addition to publishing Story, the Burnetts edited anthologies of stories and fiction, along with "Story Jubilee: Thirty-Three Years of Story" (1965). The Burnetts also operated Story Press, a book-publishing concern. Story magazine closed down in 1971, and Whitney Burnett died two years later.         In 1977, Mrs. Burnett married William Zeisel, who died in 1980. Wrotes Novels and Textbooks         Mrs. Burnett's novels were "A Woman in Possession" (1951), "This Heart, This Hunter" (1953), "The Brain Pickers" (1957) and "The Watch on the Wall" (1965). She also wrote a number of textbooks, including "On Writing a Short Story," which was published in 1983.         Mrs. Burnett, whose family name was Southgate, had little formal schooling in her native St. Louis. She spent a good deal of time at colleges as the daughter and niece of trustees. She was married in the 1930's to Robert Abbott, a college teacher, but the marriage ended in divorce.         Later, she returned to campuses to teach literature and creative writing at schools like Sarah Lawrence, Wagner College, Hunter College and the University of Missouri.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, John Burnett, of Bali, Indonesia, and six grandchildren.       
         Aline MacMahon, an actress whose stage, screen, radio and television career lasted more than 50 years, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She apparently died from pneumonia, friends said.         A veteran of 43 films, Miss MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in "Dragon Seed" in 1944, appearing as the Chinese mother to the part played by Katharine Hepburn.         A Warner Brothers casting director in 1933 placed Miss MacMahon among the 10 smartest actresses, in a class with Miss Hepburn and Helen Hayes. Miss MacMahon's beauty inspired Cecil Beaton to photograph her and Isamu Noguchi to sculpture a marble bust. 'Beauty and Vitality and Truth'         Raves acclaimed her early role in Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," in 1926. Alexander Woollcott, the critic, said she acted "with extraordinary beauty and vitality and truth." The New Yorker said she "tempted one to rank her immediately as among the Olympians." Noel Coward called the newcomer "astonishing, moving and beautiful."         Rarely did she get a bad notice, even in productions that were otherwise panned. Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times in 1967: "I have been seeing Aline MacMahon for more years than I'm going to be honest enough or ungentlemanly enough to count. Always she has pleased me, sometimes more, sometimes less, nevertheless always."         Offstage, she was equally busy. As chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater in 1950, she organized productions for community theaters. She was active in relief charities.         Miss MacMahon was born in McKeesport, Pa., and moved to Brooklyn with her family. Her father, the late William Marcus MacMahon, was the editor of Munsey's Magazine. At her urging, her mother, Jennie Simon MacMahon, began her own stage career at the age of 53. She died in 1984, three weeks before her 107th birthday.         Miss MacMahon graduated from Barnard College in 1920 and made her Broadway debut the next year in "The Mirage." Among her more memorable plays were "Pictures in the Hallway," "Once in a Lifetime," "The Eve of Saint Mark," "The Confidential Clerk" and "All the Way Home."         Her films included "Ah, Wilderness!," with Lionel Barrymore; "Gold Diggers of 1933"; "The Search," with Montgomery Clift; "The Eddie Cantor Story"; "The Lady Is Willing," with Marlene Dietrich; "The World Changes," with Paul Muni; "Five Star Final," with Edward G. Robinson; "One Way Passage," with William Powell; "Flame and Arrow," with Burt Lancaster; "I Live My Life," with Joan Crawford, and "Babbitt."         Her final role, in 1975 with Meryl Streep, was in "Trelawny of the Wells," the same play Ms. MacMahon performed at Barnard 55 years earlier.         She was married to Clarence S. Stein, the architect who helped to design Sunnyside Gardens in Queens and to plan Radburn, N.J. There are no survivors.       
         Dorothy Berliner Commins, a concert pianist and author, died on Monday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 102 years old.         Mrs. Commins was born in New York City and made her recital debut at Town Hall at the age of 12. She studied in New York and in Europe and had an active career for five decades. Her last concert was at Town Hall in the mid-1950's.         In 1927 she married Saxe Commins, who became editor in chief at Random House. He died in 1958. Mrs. Commins's books included a biography of her husband, "What Is an Editor?" (1978); "All About the Symphony Orchestra and What It Plays" (1961); "Lullabies of the World" (1967), and a compilation of letters exchanged by her husband and the playwright Eugene O'Neill.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Frances Commins Bennett of New Haven, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Emily M. Rosenthal, the director of the 92d Street Y nursery school from 1946 to 1966, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Rosenthal, who lived in the Salvation Army Williams Residence in Manhattan, died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Omus Hirshbein, vice chairman of the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92d Street Y.M.H.A., said yesterday that Miss Rosenthal "was an extraordinary woman in the sense that she brought a cultured aspect of the Old World that is gone today, and passed that on to many generations of kids."         She was widely credited with doing much to shape and develop the school, which was founded in 1938.  Handicraft From Rubble         Miss Rosenthal, a German refugee, came to New York after teaching in England. At a Y nursery school celebration in 1981, Janet Fisher, one of its vice presidents, recalled that in England Miss Rosenthal had turned bomb shelters into nurseries, showing children how to make handicraft items from milk cartons and other materials found in the air-raid rubble.         "She did the same thing here at the Y with found objects," Mrs. Fisher recalled. "She made magic out of nothing."         Miss Rosenthal was born in the city of Krefeld in Germany, attended school in Bonn and graduated from a teacher training college in Frankfurt. She went on to teach at a girls' school in Krefeld and later became the director of a municipal kindergarten there.         In 1939, she fled Germany through the Netherlands to Britain, and in late 1940 she joined her mother and a brother in the United States. She held various teaching posts in New York before becoming director of the nursery school at the Y. After retiring from the school, she taught adult arts and crafts at the Y into the 1970's.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells.         Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,         A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate. Calculated Past G.N.P.         After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.         In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.         In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.         Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.  Work in Restaurants         When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.         The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.         She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.         She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.       
         Alice R. Bachrach, a volunteer leader of numerous national social service agencies who was involved in a landmark discrimination suit, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bachrach died of cancer, her family said.         Among her early activities, she organized and was chairwoman of the Women's Division of the National Jewish Welfare Board and was a vice president of the board for 19 years. She was a board member of the United Service Organizations during World War II and the Korean war.         She also had been an honorary governor of Hebrew Union College, vice president of the New York City Y.W.H.A., vice president of the national Girl Scouts and chairwoman of its American Girl magazine, executive committee member of the New York Blood Center and a trustee of the Parsons School of Design.         Mrs. Bachrach, whose maiden name was Rothschild, was born and grew up in Manhattan and studied at Parsons. She married Alfred R. Bachrach, a prominent accounting executive and president of Temple Emanu-El, the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. Mr. Bachrach has since died.         In a landmark case 30 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach filed a religious-discrimination complaint against a Park Avenue cooperative for rejecting their application to buy an apartment. The city Human Rights Commission upheld their complaint and moved for injunctive relief, the first time the agency exercised that remedy against a cooperative.         Mrs. Bachrach is survived by her twin sons, John, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Robert, of Manhattan and Southbury, Conn., and a daughter, Ellin Gordon, of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Aline Laveen MacMahon, an actress whose career on the stage, screen, radio and television lasted more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She apparently died from pneumonia, friends said.         A veteran of 43 films, Miss MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in "Dragon Seed" in 1944, appearing as the Chinese mother to the part played by Katharine Hepburn.         A Warner Brothers casting director in 1933 named Miss MacMahon one of the 10 smartest actresses, in a class with Miss Hepburn and Helen Hayes. Miss MacMahon's beauty inspired Cecil Beaton to photograph her and Isamu Noguchi to sculpt a marble bust. 'Beauty and Vitality and Truth'         Raves acclaimed her early role in Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," in 1926. Alexander Woollcott, the critic, said she acted "with extraordinary beauty and vitality and truth." The New Yorker magazine said she "tempted one to rank her immediately as among the Olympians." Noel Coward called the newcomer "astonishing, moving and beautiful."         Rarely did she get a bad notice, even in productions that were otherwise panned. Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times in 1967: "I have been seeing Aline MacMahon for more years than I'm going to be honest enough or ungentlemanly enough to count. Always she has pleased me, sometimes more, sometimes less, nevertheless always."         Offstage, she was equally busy. As chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater in 1950, she organized productions for community theaters. She was active in relief charities.         Miss MacMahon was born in McKeesport, Pa., and moved to Brooklyn with her family. Her father, the late William Marcus MacMahon, was the editor of Munsey's Magazine. At her urging, her mother, Jennie Simon MacMahon, began her own stage career at the age of 53. She died in 1984, three weeks before her 107th birthday.         From Barrymore to Streep         Miss MacMahon graduated from Barnard College in 1920 and made her Broadway debut the next year in "The Mirage." Among her more memorable plays were "Pictures in the Hallway," "Once in a Lifetime," "The Eve of Saint Mark," "The Confidential Clerk" and "All the Way Home."         Her films included "Ah, Wilderness!" with Lionel Barrymore, "Gold Diggers of 1933," "The Search" with Montgomery Clift, "The Eddie Cantor Story," "The Lady Is Willing" with Marlene Dietrich, "The World Changes" with Paul Muni, "Five Star Final" with Edward G. Robinson, "One Way Passage" with William Powell, "Flame and Arrow" with Burt Lancaster, "I Live My Life" with Joan Crawford and "Babbitt."         Her final role, in 1975 with Meryl Streep, was in "Trelawny of the Wells" -- the same play Ms. MacMahon performed in at Barnard 55 years earlier.         She was married to the late Clarence S. Stein, the architect who helped design Sunnyside Gardens in Queens and plan Radburn, N.J. There are no survivors.       
         Marion Letcher Bohmrich, a research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services and with the United States Mission to the United Nations, died on Thursday at Fair Haven Home in Bostic, N.C., where she was a resident. She was 89 years old.         She died of pneumonia and suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, a spokesperson for the home said. She had requested that her remains be made available for research at the Alzheimer's Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C.         Mrs. Bohmrich, a daughter of a Foreign Service officer, traveled and studied in Western Europe, focusing on German culture and tradition. In 1941, she was recruited by the O.S.S., forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, as a social science analyst.         After World War II, she was transferred to the Department of State and sent to the Mission to the United Nations, where she worked with Eleanor Roosevelt when she was chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights from 1946 to 1951.         A native of Turin, Ga., she attended a number of schools in Europe, Mexico and the United States, including Columbia University.         Her first marriage to John Moore McKeehan Woodburn, a writer and editor, ended in divorce. She later married Louis Bohmrich, a Foreign Service officer and lecturer on foreign affairs, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a stepson, Roger Bohmrich of White Plains, and a sister, Adele Letcher Goddard of Sun City, Ariz.       
         Charlotte Moorman, the cellist, avant-gardist and performance artist who won notoriety for her arrest by the New York City police in 1967 for playing the cello nude from the waist up, died yesterday in Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, which she had been fighting since 1979, said a friend, Barbara Moore.         "Historically, she will be seen as very important to the history of video and performance art," said John G. Hanhardt, curator of film and video at the Whitney Museum of American Art. "She was a vital presence and had a passionate commitment to the avant-garde. She contributed to the humanization of television and video."         She was called "The Jeanne d'Arc of New Music" by the composer Edgard Varese. Ms. Moorman was arrested on Feb. 9, 1967, by two policemen who interrupted her performance at the Cinematheque in Manhattan of "Opera Sextronique" by Nam June Paik, a composer, video artist and performance artist. She was performing nude, as the score had dictated, before an audience of 200 invited guests. Although Mr. Paik was released from custody and not charged, Ms. Moorman was tried and convicted for partial nudity. Later, the sentence was suspended.         In February 1977, a decade after the arrest, Ms. Moorman and Mr. Paik staged a re-creation of their original presentation, called "The People of the State of New York Against Charlotte Moorman." This time, the audience paid $10 a ticket, and this time the two police officers who stormed the stage and threw a coat around Ms. Moorman's shoulders were actors.         Madeline Charlotte Moorman was born in Little Rock, Ark., where she grew up, on Nov. 18, 1933. She received a bachelor's degree in music at Centenary College in Shreveport, La., and studied cello with Horace Britt at the University of Texas in Austin from 1956 to 1957.         Subsequently, she studied cello at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and became a member of Jacob Glick's Boccerini Players from 1958 to 1963. She was also a member of the American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski.  Works Called Scandalous         When asked during an interview how she had become interested in the avant-garde, Ms. Moorman said that one day she had grown of a Kabalevsky cello piece and someone had suggested that she try playing John Cage's "26 Minutes, 1.499 Seconds for a String Player," which, among other things, requires the performer to prepare and eat mushrooms.         In 1963, Ms. Moorman was the founder of the Annual New York Avant-Garde Art Festival. Although it wasn't strictly annual, she presided over 15 festivals during the ensuing years. The last one was in 1982. The events showcased artists, often attracted wide publicity and took place at locales like Shea Stadium, Grand Central Terminal, the Staten Island Ferry and the World Trade Center.         She first collaborated with Mr. Paik in 1964. Other works were composed for her by Joseph Beuys and Jim McWilliams. She also performed works by Yoko Ono, who was once her roommate.         Some of Ms. Moorman's best-known pieces, many of them deemed to be scandalous at the time they were performed, are "Cello Sonata No. 1 for Adults Only" in 1965; "TV Bra for Living Sculpture," in 1969, in which she wore a bra made of two small television sets; "Global Groove," a video performance in 1973, and a 1971 Nam June Paik piece, popularly known as "The TV Cello," in which Ms. Moorman played a cello made out of three television sets, to which strings had been attached.         She is survived by her second husband, Frank Pileggi, of Manhattan.         Correction:  December 4, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary on Nov. 9 about the cellist and performance artist Charlotte Moorman misattributed three works she performed. "Cello Sonata No. 1 for Adults Only," "TV Bra for Living Sculpture" and "Global Groove" were all by Nam June Paik, not by Ms. Moorman.       
         Eleanor Pollock Hughes, former top editor of three national magazines and a public relations executive for several Federal agencies, died Friday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 91 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.         Mrs. Hughes died of heart disease, friends said.         Known professionally as Eleanor Pollock, she was a magazine editor in New York City for nearly three decades, starting in the 1930's. She was the editor in chief of Cue and Family Life, the managing editor of Charm and an assistant to Fleur Cowles in the women's division of Look and Quick magazines at Cowles Publications.         Switching to daily newspapers, she became the editor of the women's section at the Philadelphia Bulletin from the late 1950's to 1965. In that period she was also chairwoman of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award organization. Held Various Federal Posts         Serving in the Government from 1965 to 1973, she variously held the posts of the White House liaison for Project Head Start, public affairs director for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Commission on Product Safety and the National Commission on Materials Policy and press secretary to Betty Furness, when she was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs.         After leaving government employment, Mrs. Hughes did freelance writing and public relations consulting.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Alice Leal Pollock, an actress and playwright, and was educated at the Gardner and Finch Schools.         She was married and divorced from Byron Darnton, a reporter for The New York Times who was the first American correspondent killed while covering World War II. Her second husband, Albion Hughes, also a journalist, is deceased.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Madeleine Martin, an artist and founder of the Peter and Madeleine Martin Foundation for the Creative Arts, died on Saturday in San Francisco. She was 69 years old and had homes in San Francisco and Fair Harbor, L.I.         She died of liver disease, her brother, Nelson Doubleday, said.         Mrs. Martin, a daughter of Ellen Doubleday and Atwood Violett, was born in New York City. She and her husband, Peter, who died in 1988, operated the New Yorker Bookstore, an Upper West Side institution that closed in 1982.         Mrs. Martin became an artist after serving in the Waves in World War II and after attending the California School of Fine Arts, where she studied under Hassell Smith. In 1990 she founded the arts foundation, which recognizes and rewards artists.         In addition to Mr. Doubleday, who lives in Hobe Sound, Fla., and Locust Valley, L.I., she is survived by a daughter, Lavinia Dimond of Ranchos de Taos, N.M.; two sisters, Ellen Violett of Manhattan, and Neltje, of Banner, Wyo.; two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.         Mrs. Kriendler was born in New York City and was a graduate of New York University. During World War II she served in a number of executive positions with the Brooklyn chapter of the Motor Transport Service of the American Women's Voluntary Services, the organization that aided the armed forces and local military bases.         She married Mr. Kriendler in 1933, three years after his brother, Jack, founded "21" Club on West 52d Street. Mr. Kriendler was chairman from 1938 to 1989, when he became honorary chairman.         Mrs. Kriendler was a longtime contributor to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera and helped raise funds for them. She also contributed to Cornell University Veterinary School in Ithaca, N.Y.         Besides her husband, there are no immediate survivors.       
         Margaret Eyring Moreland, a psychologist who practiced in New York for many years, died on Friday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 76 years old and lived in Yarmouth Port, Mass.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Moreland, a native of New York City, graduated from City College and Fordham University, where she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology. She began her career in 1940 at the New York Domestic Relations Court. In World War II she served as an Army psychologist and then worked at several institutions in New York, Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y. She retired as an educational psychologist at City College in 1980.         At her death she was a board member at Access House, a safe haven for abused teen-aged girls in Falmouth. A summer resident of Cape Cod since 1969, she moved there permanently two years ago.         She is survived by son, Don, of Harwich, Mass., and a brother, Edward J. Eyring of Langhorne, Pa.
