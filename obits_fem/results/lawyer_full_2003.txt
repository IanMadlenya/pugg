         Nearly 50 years after the death of her son, Emmett Till, who was murdered and thrown into a river in Mississippi, Mamie Till Mobley died here today, still clinging to the hope for justice. She was 81.         The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking tonight at a news conference on behalf of the family inside her home, said Mrs. Mobley had been having dialysis about three times a week for some time and that she suffered cardiac arrest today. Family members said she was rushed to Jackson Park Hospital, where she died about 2:30 p.m.         After the killing of her 14-year-old son in 1955 in Money, Miss., Mrs. Mobley allowed his mutilated body to be displayed in an open coffin during his funeral service, where mourners recoiled at the sight of Emmett's wounds.         His death came to symbolize the brutality in the racist South and became a symbol of the civil rights movement. Emmett was killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman, an act that in the Jim Crow South could mean a lynching for a black man.         Mrs. Mobley became an outspoken champion for children in poor neighborhoods and spent more than half her life keeping alive the memory of Emmett and the hope of bringing his killers to justice. At the time of her death, she was writing a book, ''Death of Innocence,'' which is to be published this fall by Random House.         No one was ever convicted in her only son's death, a fact that drove Mrs. Mobley to speak out about racial injustice for more than four decades.         ''It was very difficult; that's what kept her living all 81 years,'' said Airickca Gordon, 33, a surrogate granddaughter, who was reared by Mrs. Mobley.         ''Her ultimate goal was to bring justice for what happened to her son. She was constantly speaking on it, trying to get the story out,'' Ms. Gordon said. ''She was yet doing activist work. She never stopped. That's what kept her going.''         Ms. Gordon said she would most remember Mrs. Mobley for her spirit.         ''Her will and her spirit,'' she said, calling her ''a strong-willed woman.''         In addition to writing the current book, with Chris Benson, a Chicago lawyer and author, on her son's case, Mrs. Mobley is also featured in a new documentary, ''The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,'' by Keith Beauchamp.         Mr. Jackson praised Mrs. Mobley as a woman of strength who did not harbor hate and who used her son's death to transform the lives of others.         ''She was still consoling and still teaching,'' Mr. Jackson said.         ''What must be put into perspective is that we often say the modern Civil Rights movement began with Rosa Parks in Montgomery. That's really not accurate,'' Mr. Jackson said. He said Emmett's murder ''broke the emotional chains of Jim Crow.''         ''Mrs. Mobley did a profound strategic thing,'' Mr. Jackson added. ''With his body water-soaked and defaced, most people would have kept the casket covered. She let the body be exposed. More than 100,000 people saw his body lying in that casket here in Chicago. That must have been at that time the largest single civil rights demonstration in American history.''         After Emmett's death, Mrs. Mobley recently told The Times, ''at first, I just wanted to go in a hole and hide my face from the world.''         But she said she soon began to talk about her son's death and to sound the call for justice.         ''It gives me a chance to get out what is clogged up inside, because if I don't talk, it stays in and worries me,'' she said. ''If I can let it go, even though I cry sometimes, I have some relief.''         She believed that her son's dying ultimately was not in vain. And despite what was done to him, Mrs. Mobley said, ''I have not spent one minute hating.''         Services are pending.       
         Sylvia Regan Ellstein, who wrote a two-act comedy, ''The Fifth Season,'' a Broadway hit in 1953, died Jan. 18 in Manhattan. She was 94.         The play, by Sylvia Regan, as she was widely known, was a comedy about the dress trade. Brooks Atkinson, reviewing it in The New York Times, called it ''an entertaining piece of merchandise.''         Sylvia Hoffenberg was born in New York and attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.         As Sylvia Hoffman she began on the Broadway stage in 1926 as Anna, a Rumanian girl, in ''The Americans,'' a comedy about assimilating American ways. In the 1930's she was married to and divorced from James J. Regan, a lawyer, and did public relations work in theater.         ''Morning Star,'' a drama she wrote about immigrant family life on Manhattan's Lower East Side, opened on Broadway in 1940. It closed after 55 performances but has lived on in a Yiddish musical version and other productions.         In 1940 she married Abraham Ellstein. They contributed to a musical comedy, ''Great to be Alive!,'' which had its Broadway premiere in 1950.         Mr. Ellstein died in 1963. Her survivors include three brothers.       
         Noriko Sawada Bridges Flynn, a writer and civil rights worker who managed to transcend the struggle between management and labor in her personal and professional life, died on Feb. 7 at her home in Pescadero, Calif. She was 79.         Her first marriage, to Harry Bridges, the fiery Marxist leader of the West Coast longshoremen's union, required a change in legislation. After his death more than three decades later, she married Ed Flynn, president of a Pacific shippers association, who had long skirmished with Mr. Bridges across bargaining tables and picket lines.         For half a century, Ms. Flynn worked for union rights, fair treatment of immigrants and racial and sexual equality but was best known for her contrasting marriages.         Her first wedding, planned as an elopement, was initially thwarted by a Nevada law forbidding marriage between whites and Asians. She was the American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, and Mr. Bridges was an immigrant from Australia. Friends said Ms. Flynn had a wicked sense of humor. She married Mr. Flynn, the shipping boss, on May Day, the international socialist holiday.         Ms. Flynn grew up on rented land near Los Angeles, where her parents grew fruit and vegetables. Beginning in 1942, when the government ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast, the family spent three years in a desert camp in Arizona. After the war, she moved to the San Francisco area, where for 12 years she was a secretary for Charles Garry, a lawyer whose clients included leading political dissidents and radicals. Mr. Garry introduced her to Mr. Bridges.         As Ms. Flynn described that first meeting to Robert Cherny, a history professor at San Francisco State University who is working on a biography of Mr. Bridges, her future husband was quite drunk. ''Where have you been?'' he mumbled. She replied, ''You mean, as in all your life?''         A relationship ensued and in December 1958, the couple drove to Reno for what they hoped would be a quiet and private wedding.         However, when Mr. Bridges, 58, and Ms. Sawada, 35, asked for a marriage license, the clerk explained that an 1846 law prohibited marriages between whites and Asians. Mr. Bridges protested, saying that his bride was an American, born in the United States, while he was the foreigner.         News accounts quoted the clerk as saying, ''It's not a matter of where you were born. It's the blood. It's against the law here.''         Mr. Bridges quickly took his case to the national press. Within four days lawyers for the couple succeeded in having the law struck down. The two obtained their license and were married in Reno.         For the next 32 years, until Mr. Bridges died in 1990, they were one of San Francisco's most prominent couples. She resumed the studies interrupted by her internment and wrote articles about her childhood for several national magazines. She was also at her husband's side in the 1970's when he stepped up his union's battle with the shippers for guarantees of job security.         In that bitter struggle, Mr. Bridges's major adversary was Ed Flynn, president of the Pacific Maritime Association. In 1971 a strike by Mr. Bridges's union shut down all 56 Pacific ports. But the two men liked and respected each other and understood each other's positions, Mr. Cherny said. He said they would battle in negotiations and then go out for dinner with their wives.         After they both retired, they continued to see each other. And after Harry Bridges's death, his widow kept in touch with his old opponent, who had become a widower. They married in 1994.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Flynn is survived by a daughter, Katherine Bridges Wiggins of Bandon, Ore., and two stepchildren, Robert Bridges of Fremont, Calif., and Marie Shell of San Francisco.       
         Martha Wright Griffiths, a longtime United States representative who was a legend in Michigan Democratic politics and one of the most effective women's civil rights legislators of her day, died on Tuesday at her home in Armada, Mich. She was 91.         Known for her sharp intellect and blunt language, she entered Congress in 1955, was re-elected nine times and served through 1974, when she chose not to run again. She successfully fought to bring women under the protection of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, her crowning achievement in Congress.         Her persistence became a decisive factor in House approval of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution in 1970. It was her second triumph as a lawmaker, even though it remained a symbolic victory.         Mrs. Griffiths pursued passage of the amendment calmly, with the persuasive skills of the trial lawyer she once was. Her arguments went a long way toward persuading a male-dominated House to subscribe to a cause that had been on the table for 47 years, since women got the vote in 1923.         The Senate followed suit in 1972, and the proposed amendment then went to the states for approval. It gained a majority but fell three states short of the 38 needed for ratification.         Opponents of ratification raised the specter of economic ruin and combat duty for women, but Mrs. Griffiths continued the fight at the state level. She and Phyllis Schlafly, a principal opponent, sharply debated the issue at a national forum in 1976.         ''If we had five minutes more,'' said Rosemary Mullaney, one of the forum's organizers, ''they would have killed each other.''         For much of her life, Mrs. Griffiths scored firsts, like becoming the first woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee. She also sat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and was chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy.         Such key assignments gave her leverage to lobby for giving women specific protection under the Civil Rights Act. As proposed, the bill would have barred discrimination on the basis of race, religion or national origin; she led the drive to add ''sex'' as a listed category.         Mrs. Griffiths noted that inequalities could run either way, telling her colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee at one point, ''I am tired of paying into a pension fund to support your widow but not my widower.''         She ascribed part of her success to her husband and sometime law partner, Hicks G. Griffiths, who was once state Democratic chairman of Michigan. He died in 1996.         She was born Martha Wright in Pierce City, Mo., the daughter of a rural mail carrier, and became a champion debater in high school. She met Mr. Griffiths, a fellow student, at the University of Missouri, where both were on the debating team.         They eloped the year before she graduated in 1934. They studied law, and in 1940 were the first couple to graduate together from the University of Michigan Law School.         They went into practice in Detroit in 1946 as Griffiths & Griffiths. Another partner was G. Mennen Williams, whom they helped in his bid for governor in 1948. By then Mrs. Griffiths had lost her first race for the state Legislature.         She gained a seat in the state House, one of only two women in that chamber from 1949 to 1952, when she lost her first bid for Congress. Instead, Governor Williams appointed her to the bench of Recorder's Court in Detroit, and she was a judge until her election to the House in 1954, the first Democratic woman elected to Congress from Michigan.         After leaving Congress, she inhabited corporate boardrooms where few women had ever been members. She returned to politics in 1982, when James J. Blanchard, the Democratic candidate for governor, made her his running mate. She was elected lieutenant governor and re-elected with him in 1986.         Governor Blanchard's decision to replace her on his ticket in 1990 caused political furor in Michigan. Mr. Blanchard indicated that he had dropped her because of her age and increasing frailty, but Mrs. Griffiths, ever feisty, took issue and said women and the elderly had put Mr. Blanchard into office in the first place.         Mr. Blanchard narrowly lost the election to John M. Engler, a Republican.         ''I don't know if I feel vindicated, but I think it clearly shows that I won it for him the first two times,'' Mrs. Griffiths said after Mr. Blanchard's defeat. ''I feel bad for him, but he took some very bad advice.''       
         Kathleen Winsor, whose 1944 novel ''Forever Amber,'' detailing the sexual adventures of a young woman in Restoration England, became a model for romantic best sellers to follow, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         ''Miss Winsor, if she felt so inclined, could justifiably claim to be the woman who invented the modern best seller,'' Rachel Cooke wrote in The Observer, a London newspaper, last year. Ms. Cooke pointed out that the ''preposterously long and sumptuously naughty book'' appeared 12 years before Grace Metalious's Peyton Place and 22 years before Jacqueline Susann's ''Valley of the Dolls.''         Amber St. Clare, the heroine of Ms. Winsor's 972-page work, runs through lovers from a highwayman named Black Jack Mallard to King Charles II at a pace that led a reviewer to recommend using an adding machine to keep track. Amber's flair with words amplifies the effect: ''Adultery is not a crime, it's an amusement,'' she purrs.         Though mild by today's standards, the book's raciness drew readers by the thousands, selling 100,000 copies the first week after it was published. Eventually as many as 3 million copies were sold, published reports said.         MacMillan, the publisher, promoted the book with unusual vigor, hoping to emulate its 1936 success with ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was helped immeasurably when the Hays Office, the morality board for the movie industry, condemned the book even before a movie deal was signed; it became a hit in 1947 with Linda Darnell as Amber and Cornel Wilde as her truest love. Equally useful was its being banned in Boston, not to mention the rest of Massachusetts.         For readers without an adding machine, the attorney general of Massachusetts helpfully reported that he had counted 70 references to sexual intercourse, 39 illegitimate pregnancies, seven abortions and 10 descriptions of women undressing in front of men. The decision by a Massachusetts appeals court judge to reverse the initial ban was less valuable in a commercial sense: he said the book put him to sleep. But many reviewers hailed the results of Ms. Winsor's five years of research, saying her descriptions of the Great Fire of London and the Great Plague seemed vivid and accurate.         The novel, Ms. Winsor's first, made her rich, which she suggested in an interview might have been her motivation in the first place.         ''That's what every writer really wants: to make money,'' she said in an interview with the newspaper PM in 1945.         Ms. Winsor was born on Oct. 16, 1919, in Olivia, Minn., and claimed English ancestors who moved to America as early as 1630. She grew up in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of California there. While still a student she married Robert John Herwig, a football star. When her husband was working on a class paper on the death of Charles II, she browsed through one of his books and became fascinated by England's Restoration period. She read 356 books on the subject and wrote five drafts of her novel, meticulously counting the hours she worked: 4,967.         ''I can't say I was surprised when it was accepted,'' she said in an interview quoted in Current Biography. ''It seemed only justice after five years of effort.''         She wrote seven more novels, but none came close to the success of her first. After her divorce from Mr. Herwig, she married the bandleader Artie Shaw and then Arnold Krakower, the lawyer who handled her divorce from Mr. Shaw. Her fourth and last husband was Paul A. Porter, a lawyer, who died in 1975. She had no immediate survivors.         Ms. Winsor always pooh-poohed those who considered ''Forever Amber'' too daring. ''I wrote only two sexy passages, and my publishers took both of them out,'' she was quoted as saying in Contemporary Authors Online. ''They put ellipses instead. In those days, you could solve everything with an ellipse.''       
         Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, a lawyer and psychiatrist who founded the drug treatment program Odyssey House and went on to give widely quoted but sometimes disputed testimony on subjects like child abuse and pornography, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Dr. Sarah Baden, who added that her mother lived in Westport, Conn., and had come to New York for Mother's Day.         In 1966, Dr. Densen-Gerber founded Odyssey House, one of the earlier drug-free therapeutic communities that helped addicts recover. She was a leading advocate of such programs, which involved group residence and group therapy, as opposed to methadone-maintenance programs.         She got to know Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller when she picketed in front of his house to demand funds for her program, and they became friends. In the 1970's she became a conspicuous figure at public hearings, society balls and ghetto demonstrations with her bouffant hairdo, rhinestone-studded glasses and cigars.         A 1979 profile in New York magazine quoted Mayor Edward I. Koch as saying that she was ''one of those seminal forces, original, a go-getter.'' He said there were ''few people who can claim as many accomplishments.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber's success at getting government help became her downfall when the state investigated her use of public funds in the early 1980's and found irregularities. She resigned as executive director of Odyssey House in 1983, but remained active in affiliated programs.         Her influence extended to areas like child pornography. In 1977, her testimony that there were 264 monthly publications devoted to the subject helped persuade the House of Representatives to unanimously pass a bill to regulate it.         IPT, the publication of the Institute for Psychological Therapy, reported in 1992 that later government investigations proved her estimates to be exaggerated by ''several orders of magnitude.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber also commented on many other hot issues from a psychiatric point of view.         In 1991, she went to Omaha to testify in court that her interview with a man convinced her he had witnessed four satanic ritual killings. She characterized herself as an expert at deprogramming survivors of satanic cults.         In 1997, she appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television program to analyze a videotape of JonBenet Ramsey in a children's beauty contest.         Her unorthodox approach extended to her psychiatric practice. In 1999, she agreed to pay $200,000 to settle a civil lawsuit over her inability to account for 1,270 vials of medicinal cocaine. She denied any violation of the law.         She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1934. Her mother, Beatrice Densen, who had kept her own name, was an heiress of the Densen paper-box fortune. Her father, Gustave Gerber, a chemical engineer, became a lawyer in his 40's and was considering studying medicine in his 60's.         Dr. Densen-Gerber's parents persuaded her to study law before supporting her through medical school. She graduated from Columbia Law School and New York University Medical School. She did her residency at Metropolitan Hospital, where during one of her pregnancies, the director suggested she spend an hour or two a day working with addicts. That led to her assembling, in 1966, a group of addicts who wanted to cure themselves without using drugs. Before she found a home for them, they slept in 11 temporary shelters, giving rise to the name Odyssey.         Her original capital was $3.82, and dinner was often rice and spaghetti. Her first permanent building, on East 109th Street, was rented for $17 a month. There were 17 residents.         Within four years, other Odyssey Houses had started to spring up in other cities. In New York, Dr. Densen-Gerber reached out to new populations like prostitutes and addicted mothers.         Her own celebrity grew, and in 1981 The New York Times noted her costume at the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria. She wore a leather lionlike mask and a lionlike coiffure.         By the next year, Dr. Densen-Gerber faced stiff challenges. She agreed to pay back $20,000 in excessive personal expenses to close a state investigation. News reports suggested she had become intoxicated with her own power.         ''I remember her grandly lying back and being grande dame to all the peons who were lying around,'' Nancy Hoving, a former member of Odyssey's advisory council, said in a New York magazine interview.         In 1997, her marriage to Michael Baden, who had been the city's medical examiner and a top forensic official for the state police, burned out in a flurry of lawsuits and spectacular accusations.         The marriage's beginning had also been unusual. Mr. Baden said in an interview with The Daily News in 1989 that he took her to an autopsy on their first date and proposed by phone while assisting in the post-mortem on the bullet-riddled body of the mobster Albert Anastasia.         In addition to her daughter Sarah, Dr. Densen-Gerber is survived by another daughter, Trissa Baden of Hopewell, N.J.; a son, Lindsey, of Brookline, Mass.; and two grandchildren.       
         The Rev. Shirley Bulah Stamps, whose parents' fight for her to ride a school bus became part of the 1954 Supreme Court case that ended school segregation, died on Wednesday in Wilmington, Del. She was 59.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.         Shirley Bulah was 8 when her parents, Fred and Sarah, grew tired of driving her two miles to a black school in Hockessin, Del., a suburb of Wilmington. Each day, a bus went right by their home on its way to a far better white school.         In 1951, with the help of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Bulahs sued not just for a bus ride; they also asked a state court for admission to the white school.         They won, and for the first time, a segregated white public school was ordered by an American court to admit black children. Thurgood Marshall, then director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called it ''the first real victory in our campaign to destroy segregation.''         After the decision was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court, an appeal by the state board of education reached the United States Supreme Court, as part of a bundle of cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Delaware. Together the cases became known as Oliver L. Brown, et al., v. the Board of Education of Topeka. The Delaware case was unique in that all the other state courts had upheld segregation.         The decision of the court was unanimous in ending school segregation in the United States. The opinion, written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, repeatedly cited the reasoning and language of Collins Jacques Seitz, the Delaware judge who presided over the Bulahs' case.         Shirley was adopted by the Bulahs after Sarah Bulah read in the Wilmington newspapers in 1945 about an abandoned 10-month-old baby, according to Richard Kluger in his book, ''Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality'' (Knopf, 1976). Her husband, who worked as a foreman in a paper mill, had eight children, four of whom survived into adulthood, from his first marriage, but Mrs. Bulah was in her 50's and childless.         When Mrs. Bulah wrote to state education authorities to complain about the lack of a bus for her child, she was eventually told that the state constitution required racially segregated educational facilities and that buses fell under that definition.         Mrs. Bulah went to Louis L. Redding, a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the first black admitted to the Delaware bar.         ''He said he wouldn't help me get a Jim Crow bus to take my girl to any Jim Crow school,'' Mrs. Bulah told Mr. Kluger, ''but if I was interested in sendin' her to an integrated school, why, then maybe he'd help. Well, I thanked God right then and there.''         Mr. Kluger wrote that many blacks in the area were upset with the legal action because they had no desire to associate with white people. But Shirley was welcomed by her new white classmates.         ''They came to my birthday parties at my house, and I went to theirs,'' she said in an interview with The News Journal of Wilmington in April. ''I didn't have to worry about being punched or worry about getting gum in my hair.''         After graduating from high school, the News Journal reported, she was a nurse in the military, where she met Phillip E. Stamps. They married, and when he retired they moved to Maryland. He died in 1996 and she moved back to Delaware.         She was ordained as a minister in 1984 and was pastor of four churches, the last the St. James African Union Methodist Church in Wilmington.         She is survived by her son, Phillip Jr., of Baltimore, and three grandchildren.       
         Lois Fried Rosenfield, a theatrical and film producer with her husband, Maurice, died on May 25 at her home in Glencoe, Ill. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Rosenfield and her husband backed Broadway productions like ''Barnum'' (1980), a 1983 revival of ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''Singin' in the Rain'' (1985), which they also presented in London.         Their company, Rosenfield Productions, got its start in 1973 with the film ''Bang the Drum Slowly,'' a classic baseball tale. Mrs. Rosenfield took credit for casting a virtually unknown Robert De Niro as the doomed catcher, and Mr. Rosenfield, a Chicago corporate lawyer, appeared as a team owner.         Off Broadway, in 1988, the couple helped produce a new play by Athol Fugard, ''The Road to Mecca.'' They also produced ''Falsettoland'' Off Broadway and ''Other People's Money'' in Chicago.         Lois Rosenfield grew up in Chicago, the daughter of a clothing manufacturer. She attended public schools and the University of Wisconsin. Besides her husband, she is survived by her sons, James, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Andrew, of Lake Forest, Ill.; her brothers, Howard and Donald Fried; and four grandchildren.       
         Gladys Heldman, an instrumental figure in the formation of women's professional tennis, died Sunday at her home in Sante Fe, N.M. She was 81.         The Sante Fe Police Department reported that Ms. Heldman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police report said she had been experiencing health difficulties.         Ms. Heldman, the founder, publisher and editor of World Tennis magazine, began playing tennis at age 25. As an amateur, she was ranked No. 1 in Texas. She competed in the United States National Championships four times and at Wimbledon in 1954.         Off the court, Ms. Heldman was an indomitable force. She started World Tennis magazine in 1953 as a forum for the sport's views and problems. During its early years, the magazine was a one-woman operation, with Ms. Heldman as editor in chief, layout editor, art director and advertising director. She sold the magazine to CBS Publications in 1972.         The magazine helped transform Ms. Heldman into an advocate for women's tennis and one of the most influential people in the game.         In 1970, she used her status to help nine of the top women's players, led by Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals, form their own pro tour.         She arranged for the Houston Racquet Club to sponsor a tournament and had nearly all the players in the group sign $1 contracts with World Tennis to play in the tournament. Heldman persuaded her friend Joseph Cullman, chairman of Philip Morris, to donate prize money and sponsor five tournaments.         Despite suspensions and economic sanctions, the women's pro tour evolved into the Virginia Slims tour.         ''Without Gladys, there wouldn't be women's professional tennis,'' King said in a statement Monday. ''When I accepted that $1 contract from Gladys more than 30 years ago, I knew we were all part of something special and that women's tennis had been changed forever because of her vision.''         Gladys Medalie Heldman was born May 13, 1922, in New York City. Her father, George Z. Medalie, was a New York lawyer and judge. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University, she married Julius Heldman, a former United States junior tennis champion, in 1942.         The Heldmans' daughters, Carrie and Julie, were accomplished players; Julie was ranked as high as No. 5 in the world in 1969 and 1974.         Ms. Heldman was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1979. She is survived by her husband, her daughters and three grandchildren.       
         Generosa Ammon Pelosi, the widow of R. Theodore Ammon, a millionaire Manhattan financier who was killed at his home on Long Island in 2001, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, said Paul B. Bergman, the lawyer for Daniel Pelosi, her husband.         Mr. Ammon, who was chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center, was found bludgeoned to death on Oct. 22, 2001, at his estate in East Hampton, N.Y. His widow and Mr. Pelosi married three months later.         Mr. and Mrs. Pelosi have denied any involvement in the killing, and the authorities have not publicly named any suspects.         The Ammons were in the final stages of a divorce at the time of Mr. Ammon's death but were still married. His widow was co-executor of the estate with J. P. Morgan Chase & Company.         Mr. Pelosi, an electrician, said in an interview with The New York Post in January 2002 that he and Mrs. Pelosi, who was then Mrs. Ammon, had been planning their marriage for more than a year before the killing.         Mrs. Pelosi was born in Laguna Beach, Calif., Gotham magazine said in May 2002. She discovered from a photo inscription that her father was an Italian sailor. Her mother died when she was 10 and her only sibling, a sister, when she was 17.         Mrs. Pelosi graduated from the University of California at Irvine in 1981. She moved to New York to be an artist, working in found industrial objects, but lost interest, New York magazine said this July.         She began working as an apartment rental agent and Mr. Ammon was one of her clients. They married in the mid-1980's.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Pelosi, who lived in East Hampton, is survived by her two children, Alexa and Grego.       
         Mary Viscountess Eccles, a bibliophile who built up what is widely considered the world's finest collection of rare books and manuscripts relating to Samuel Johnson and his biographer and friend, James Boswell, died on Aug. 26 at her home, Four Oakes Farm, in Somerset County, N.J. She was 91.         Lady Eccles, the American widow of Viscount Eccles, a British politician, businessman and bibliophile who once headed the British Library in London, was first drawn to the world of the Elizabethan theater but later switched her interest and the focus of her collecting to Johnson and Boswell and their circle.         She and her first husband, Donald Frizell Hyde, a New York lawyer, acquired thousands of books and manuscripts relating to these two towering literary figures of the 18th century.         Treasures stored in the huge fireproof library they built at Four Oakes Farm include about 800 letters from Johnson -- about 80 percent of all those known to have survived -- as well as works and papers from the important A. Edward Newton collection of Johnson material, which Lady Eccles, then Mary Hyde, acquired around 1940.         The library also houses the Johnson material from the collection of James Boswell's papers found at Malahide Castle in Ireland, which she bought from the American collector Col. Ralph H. Isham at the end of World War II; Boswell's guestbook from his home at Auchinleck, Scotland; Johnson's diaries for the years 1765 to about 1784; the private journal of Hester Thrale, Johnson's great friend and benefactor; and a collection known as the R. B. Adam Library Relating to Dr. Samuel Johnson and His Era, which she bought from the Adam family of Buffalo in 1948, and which was then regarded as the best in existence.         Under the name Mary Hyde, she also wrote a number of books about her interests. In 1949, Columbia University published her doctoral thesis, ''Playwriting for Elizabethans, 1600-1605.'' In 1958 she, her first husband and E. J. McAdam Jr. edited Volume I of the Yale edition of the works of Samuel Johnson, ''Diaries, Prayers and Annals.''         In 1972 she published ''The Impossible Friendship: Boswell and Mrs. Thrale'' (Harvard), a study of Boswell's relationship with the woman who befriended Johnson. This was followed in 1975 by ''The Thrales of Streatham Park'' (Harvard), an account of Mrs. Thrale and her family.         She was awarded honorary degrees by American and British universities, including Brown, the University of Birmingham (England), the University of Massachusetts and Union College.         She was the first woman elected to the Roxburghe Club, an English association of bibliophiles, and one of the first to join the Grolier Club, another bibliophile's group, in New York City; she was vice president from 1982 to 1992.         Lady Eccles financed her collecting largely from her own family fortune. She was born Mary Morley Crapo in Detroit on July 12 1912. Her family name was derived from crapaud, the French for toad, which had been the name bestowed by Cape Cod natives on a French ancestor of hers who washed up there in 1680. But the family prospered, becoming rich from interests in cement, barges and timber, and that allowed Lady Eccles to indulge her passion for book collecting.         She earned a bachelor's degree at Vassar in 1934, a master's from Columbia in 1935 and a doctorate there in 1945. In 1939 she married Mr. Hyde, and in 1943 they bought Four Oakes Farm, which was her home for the rest of her life.         Lady Eccles described in an essay first published in The Vassar Alumnae Magazine in 1960 how she and Mr. Hyde were drawn to book collecting when they visited a rare book exhibition in Detroit and realized for the first time that books of this kind were not all locked up in libraries but available for purchase.         They also learned some of the risks. The three Shakespeare quartos they bought on that occasion turned out to be defective, Lady Eccles wrote, while a document with the purported signature of Queen Elizabeth I proved to be a fake.         From time to time Lady Eccles encountered resistance to her large-scale purchases of remaining Johnson and Boswell memorabilia in Britain. She had trouble with a patriotic Scottish customs officer when she took five trunks of Boswell papers from Colonel Isham's collection aboard the Queen Mary at Southampton. In 1968, Hugh Mainwaring, who owned the journal Mrs. Thrale kept from 1766 to 1778, refused to sell her the manuscript privately, though she subsequently got it at a Sotheby's auction.         Her first husband died in 1966. In 1984 she married Lord Eccles, who died in 1999. She is survived by two stepsons and a stepdaughter, all of whom live in England: Viscount Eccles of Mowlton, Yorkshire; Simon Eccles of London; and Polly Landsdown of Great Coxwell, Oxfordshire.         Correction:  September 9, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 30 about Mary Viscountess Eccles, a leading bibliophile and collector of material on Samuel Johnson, misspelled part of the name of her home in Somerset County, N.J., where she died. It is Four Oaks Farm, not Oakes.         Correction:  September 25, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Aug. 30 about Mary Viscountess Eccles, a leading bibliophile and collector of material on Samuel Johnson, misstated the name of the New York University professor who collaborated with her and her first husband in editing a volume of Johnson's works. He was E. L. McAdam Jr., not E. J.       
         Connie Reeves, who was very likely America's oldest cowgirl, died in San Antonio on Aug. 17, 12 days after she was thrown from her horse, Dr Pepper. She was 101.         She was riding her favorite horse, a 28-year-old paint, on the morning of Aug. 5 when Dr Pepper threw her over its head. Her neck was broken, but she was not paralyzed, The Kerrville (Tex.) Daily Times reported. The Associated Press said she died of cardiac arrest.         Meg Clark, owner of Camp Waldemar in the Texas Hill Country, where Mrs. Reeves taught riding for 67 years, said she had been riding more this year than in previous years and was delighted that Dr Pepper remained so spirited.         ''That was how she wanted to live her life, and that was how she wanted to end it,'' Ms. Clark said on Wednesday. ''She wanted to be on horseback.''         As a baby, Mrs. Reeves was photographed on a horse -- as well as on a cow, something she could never quite explain -- and went on to manage a ranch and teach about 30,000 girls to ride over the years at a summer camp. She could herd steers, shear sheep, kill rattlesnakes and cook for hungry cowhands.         At first she did not think she deserved to be inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 1997, but then decided she had as much right as the next lady, given the things she had done and the things she knew.         She knew, for example, that a horse could smell fear. When she ended up with one leg shorter than the other after falling from a horse, she did the sensible thing: she had the heel of one cowboy boot raised.         Mrs. Reeves's greatest fame came last year when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth. Reporters could not resist interviewing the hall's oldest member, whom the event's organizers were more than willing to make available.         After all, a quotation from Mrs. Reeves, ''Always saddle your own horse,'' had almost become the hall's motto. Liz Smith began a gossip column by suggesting, ''It's not a bad motto, even if you are just getting into your Mercedes.''         Many things Mrs. Reeves did seemed to make history, particularly in Texas.         She was one of the first women to study law at the University of Texas, and she started one of the state's first girls' drill teams, a movement that grew into a Texas passion. The 10,000-acre ranch she and her husband managed was owned by Lyndon B. Johnson.         In 1998, Mrs. Reeves won the Chester A. Reynolds Award for major contributions to the Western way of life from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, one of two women to do so.         Constance Douglas was born on Sept. 26, 1901, in Eagle Pass, Tex., on the Mexican border. She swam in the Rio Grande and rode horses with cowboys. Her grandfather gave her her first horse when she was 5. The family moved to San Antonio when she was 16.         Her father was a lawyer, and her mother was so genteel that she refused to go to the grocer's without gloves and a hat.         Mrs. Reeves graduated from Texas Women's University in Denton as a speech major and then attended the University of Texas School of Law, but left to take a job because her family was short of money in the Depression. She taught at two San Antonio high schools. At one, Thomas Jefferson High, she founded a drill team called the Lassos, which is still in existence.         She also started a riding stable to teach city boys and girls how to ride and care for horses. Although the stables were successful, she accepted a position as riding instructor at Camp Waldemar in 1936 for $50 a summer. She eventually taught Western and English riding styles to the granddaughters of her original students.         She came to the conclusion that horses respond best to women.         ''The harsh voices and rough bark of boys and men seem to frighten horses,'' she wrote several weeks before her death in a script for a video about riding. ''The same horse that refused to take the bit in its mouth will accept it from the more gentle hands of a girl.''         At the camp she met Jack Reeves, a former rodeo star, trick rider and keeper of the camp's horses. They married in 1942; he died in 1985. They had no children, and she left no immediate survivors.         ''I'm sure glad I don't have grandchildren,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. ''The world today, it's disturbed.''         The cowgirl found her own peace on a horse.         ''I still ride alone,'' Mrs. Reeves said in an interview with National Public Radio last year. ''Sometimes I'll just get on the horse and go down to the river. We'll just ride up and watch a little baby fawn nursing or watch the birds in a nest.         ''As long as I'm alive, I'm going to be trying to ride a horse.''       
         Marie Foster, a dental technician whose quiet but effective efforts to win voting rights for blacks made her a national symbol when she was beaten by the police in the Selma, Ala., voting rights march in 1965, died on Saturday in Selma. She was 85.         She was one of the original eight members of the Dallas County Voters League, a group that came to be called the Courageous Eight and worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to make Selma the center of a national crusade. She was later called ''the mother of the voting rights movement'' by its local organizers.         She tried eight times to register to vote before succeeding; she had already started coaching blacks on how to pass the deliberately bewildering voter registration tests.         She was clubbed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge when state troopers stopped the first march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7. Two days later, she tried to hobble forward in another march, one that was stopped peacefully.         On March 11, when President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to announce that he would send Congress a strong voting rights bill, it was in Mrs. Foster's living room that Dr. King watched and wept at the news.         When the march was finally permitted to begin on March 21, two weeks later, Mrs. Foster walked 50 miles in five days with injured knees.         In his book on the civil rights movement, ''The Children'' (Random House, 1998), David Halberstam called Mrs. Foster ''one of the heroes of the Selma group.''         Marie Priscilla Martin was born on Oct. 24, 1917, in rural Wilcox County, near Alberta, Ala. Her mother wanted her children to be educated, but her father resisted moving to town, Mrs. Foster said in a statement prepared for the Web site of the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, which she helped found. Her mother then sneaked away and took her children to Selma.         Mrs. Foster dropped out of high school to marry and had three young children when her husband died. After working for years, she returned to high school and graduated after her daughter, Rose. She then went to junior college, became a dental hygienist and went to work for her brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson.         She became involved in the growing voting rights movement because of anger over racial discrimination. Mr. Halberstam suggested that being employed by her brother protected her from economic pressure from the white establishment.         Working with the Dallas County Voters League, she went door to door with leaflets and asked all ministers in town to announce the registration effort from their pulpits.         Things at first went slowly. Taylor Branch, in his book ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998), said her first nighttime class to teach literacy for the voting test drew one student, a man in his 70's.         In 1964, she was named in an injunction against voter registration leaders along with John Lewis, the civil rights leader who is now a Georgia congressman, Mr. Branch wrote. The Ku Klux Klan threatened her life several times.         In 1985, Mrs. Foster told about her experience at the bridge in an interview with United Press International.         ''It was a trooper who hit me,'' she said, adding that it happened just as she crossed the bridge near the head of the column of about 525 demonstrators. ''I lay on the pavement with my eyes closed. I didn't move. I stood my ground.''         Mrs. Foster is survived by her son, James Foster of Indianapolis; her daughter, Rose Davis of Salt Lake City; her brothers, Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Thomas Martin, both of Selma; and three grandchildren.         Her activism never stopped, said Rose Sanders, a friend and civil rights lawyer. Among more recent battles, Mrs. Foster was a leader in successful fights for public housing for poor people in Selma and the removal of a statue of the founder of the Klan from a public park.         She conducted reading classes for underprivileged children in a small classroom next to her home, and made it a point to take poor children to Sunday school.         ''She never quit,'' Ms. Sanders said.       
         Lady Donaldson, the first woman to be lord mayor of London in the 800-year history of the office, died on Saturday at a hospice near her family home in Lymington, England. She was 82.         For one term in 1983, Lady Donaldson held the highest title of the City of London. In 1981 and 1982, she was also the first woman to be the City's sheriff, a position established 500 years before that of lord mayor.         The ancient City is not London, although it is surrounded by London. Established by a royal charter in the 12th century, it is now famous as England's financial center.         By tradition, when the queen makes a state visit there, the lord mayor, carrying a sword, meets her at the city limit. The monarch gently pushes aside the proffered sword to signify acceptance of the lord mayor's sovereignty.         After being sheriff and lord mayor, Lady Donaldson went on to lead organizations concerned with cancer and the ethics of in-vitro fertilization, to serve on Britain's press complaints commission and to be chairwoman of a committee overseeing the ombudsman appointed to supervise the banking industry.         No women have succeeded Lady Donaldson as lord mayor. Because she was married to a baron, she was called lady rather than her own title of dame, which goes with the lord mayor's job. She also insisted on being called lord mayor, rather than lady mayor, and fined anybody who feminized her title a pound.         ''The fact that I'm a woman is purely biological,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1983. ''If it encourages other women to take more positions of responsibility, then it'll have achieved something, but I'm not a feminist.''         Dorothy Mary Warwick was born in Wickham, Hampshire, on Aug. 29, 1921. Her father, Reginald George Gale Warwick, was an ironmonger. Her mother, Dorothy Alice Warwick, was a schoolteacher and the first woman to serve on her local governing council.         Miss Warwick left high school to spend a year teaching English in Paris. On her return, she began training in Oxford to become a nurse. In London during World War II, she treated soldiers returning from Dunkirk and victims of the blitz.         Toward the end of the war, she met John Donaldson, a lieutenant colonel in the army, through his mother, whom Miss Warwick cared for in the hospital. They were married in 1945.         Her husband, an eminent lawyer and judge, was appointed master of the rolls, one of the highest-ranking posts in Britain's judiciary.         ''We've always led two separate lives -- perhaps that's why our marriage works so well,'' Lady Donaldson said to The New York Times in 1983. ''We've always got something to talk about.''         In addition to her husband, Lady Donaldson is survived by a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.         Before becoming sheriff, Lady Donaldson was the first woman to be a City alderman. Another woman, Edwina Coven, was elected 17 months earlier, but was vetoed by her fellow aldermen. It was the Court of Aldermen that elected Lady Donaldson lord mayor after she had been nominated by the City's livery companies, a mixture of charitable trusts, gentlemen's clubs and guardians of craft standards and training.         Lady Donaldson shunned the lord mayor's traditional garb, as her obituary in The Daily Telegraph yesterday pointed up.         ''If I were 20 years younger and considerably slimmer I might have considered wearing knee breeches like the men,'' she said. ''I hope to do better than the men who wear a suit under the robes. I'll only need a bra and slip.''       
         Marie Marcus, a jazz pianist who was a protégée of Fats Waller and appeared on Manhattan's 52nd Street, the prewar epicenter of jazz, before becoming a summer fixture in nightclubs on Cape Cod, died on Oct. 10 in Hyannis, Mass. She was 89.         In a book about jazz personalities, ''Barney, Bradley, and Max'' (Oxford, 1989), the jazz critic Whitney Balliett suggested that Mrs. Marcus's talent and experience elevated her into a higher league than the normal run of resort acts. ''At first, her style seems a simple mélange of chunky chords and brief connective runs, but on closer examination it is a repository of the jazz piano playing of the thirties and forties,'' he wrote.         Marie Eleanor Doherty, an only child, was born in Roxbury, Mass., on May 25, 1914. Her father, a plumber, and her mother were elegant ballroom dancers and had a player piano in the house with rolls by the likes of Waller.         She started playing the piano at 4 and studied at the New England Conservatory of Music while attending Roxbury Memorial High. She started in children's radio shows and ended up in Manhattan playing the piano on a national radio show for NBC as well as in clubs, under the name Marie Doherty.         When Waller persuaded her to play in an after-hours club in Harlem, he pointed to his heart and said, ''For a white girl, you sure got it there.''         She asked him whether he knew a good piano teacher. He answered, ''How about me?'' and gave her lessons when he was in town.         With the licks she absorbed from him, she made it to 52nd Street, the epicenter of jazz, where she played at the Swing Club.         At the end of her New York years, she led a 12-piece band and, after several musicians were drafted, a six-piece one. Her agent sent her to the Coonamessett Club in Falmouth on Cape Cod, in part to help her relax from the exhausting work. The respite became a happy 40-year residency, and she became popular with both locals and tourists.         President Kennedy came to hear her and Alma Gates White play as the ''piano mamas'' at the Panama Club in Hyannis.         For many years, she also spent winters performing in Miami Beach. In the 1950's, she appeared on television shows like Steve Allen's ''Tonight'' show and the ''Dave Garroway Show.''         In 1937, she married Jack Brown, a singer. They later separated, and he died. She later married Bill Marcus, a trumpet player and later a lawyer. He died in 1965.         She is survived by her sons, Jack Brown, of Quincy, Mass., and William Marcus, of Fort Lauderdale; her daughters, Mary Liles and Barbara Marcus, both of St. Petersburg, Fla.; eight grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Day Hicks, the Boston public school official and City Council member whose opposition to busing to achieve school integration helped to polarize the city in the 1960's and made her a national symbol of racial division, died on Tuesday at her home in South Boston. She was 87.         Mrs. Hicks was the city's most prominent opponent of busing, saying it was not what parents, especially those in her almost-all-white South Boston neighborhood, wanted. To her supporters, she was a champion of working-class residents and neighborhood schools. To her opponents, she epitomized an unwillingness to breach a deep-seated racial divide in deeply segregated Boston.         ''She became the symbol, if you please, of someone who was against desegregating Boston schools,'' said Paul Parks, who was chairman of the education committee of the Boston N.A.A.C.P. in the 1960's, a former state secretary of education and a former president of the Boston School Committee. ''She would not admit segregation exists.''         Mrs. Hicks, a lawyer and the daughter of a prominent South Boston judge, spent a decade fighting against forced integration in Boston before it was ordered in 1974 by Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Federal District Court.         Mrs. Hicks was elected to the Boston School Committee in 1961. Two years later, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter declared that ''de facto segregation'' existed in the schools, citing a report that 13 schools were more than 90 percent black and significantly lacking in money. Mrs. Hicks, then the chairwoman, cast aside the issue when it was brought before the committee, asking that the board ''kindly proceed to educational matters.'' She was overwhelmingly re-elected that fall and immediately became a lightning rod for the issue.         In 1965, when Massachusetts enacted a law ordering districts to desegregate or lose state financing, Mrs. Hicks refused to back down. She said she felt that the Boston schools were being made a scapegoat by suburban legislators who wanted nothing more than to meddle in neighborhoods they knew nothing about. ''If the suburbs are so interested in solving the problems of the Negro,'' she said, ''why don't they build subsidized housing for them?''         Mrs. Hicks, the subject of numerous death threats, insisted she was not racist.         She refused to meet with Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, an ardent segregationist, telling a reporter that she did not want to be connected with him. ''The important thing is that I'm not bigoted,'' she once said.         Mrs. Hicks always insisted that she had the best interests of students in mind with her anti-busing crusade.         ''I have guarded your children well,'' she said in announcing her mayoral candidacy in 1967. ''I will continue to defend the neighborhood school as long as I have a breath left in my body.''         She did not focus on busing during the campaign, sidestepping the issue with the slogan ''You know where I stand.''         Despite a victory in the September primary, she lost the election by 12,000 votes to Kevin H. White, another first-time mayoral candidate of Irish descent who snatched up last-minute votes in the black neighborhoods of Roxbury and Mattapan.         Mrs. Hicks won election to the City Council by a landslide in 1969. In 1970 she won a race to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives, but was defeated in 1972. She was re-elected to the City Council in 1973 and 1975 and lost in 1977 and 1981, but filled a vacant seat for one year, 1979. Plagued by poor health, she then left local politics.         ''I think she was exemplary in her willingness to come to her own conclusions and really very bravely act on her convictions,'' said William M. Bulger, a former president of the State Senate and the University of Massachusetts and a native of South Boston. ''It's not true of everyone. In fact, there's a great deal of poll-taking at all times these days, but Mrs. Hicks had to recognize that she was taking a position during that time at odds with what the opinion molders certainly felt.''         Louise Day was born in South Boston on Oct. 16, 1916, although many who worked with her said she often lied about her age. She was the only daughter of William J. and Anna McCarron Day. Her mother died when Mrs. Hicks was 14, and she was especially close to her father, a lawyer, judge and businessman, whom she cited as her inspiration to become a lawyer. She graduated from Wheelock Teacher's College in Boston in 1938 and received an education degree from Boston University in 1952 and a law degree from there in 1955.         She married John Hicks, an engineer, in 1942. He died of cancer in 1968. She is survived by a son, William. Another son, John, vanished in 1978.       
         Dorothy J. Farnan, a high school English teacher whose friendship with the poet W. H. Auden and his companion, Chester Kallman, enabled her to write ''Auden in Love,'' a book about their life together, died on Oct. 23 in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Ms. Farnan bridged the worlds of the flamboyantly bohemian Greenwich Village of the 1940's and the conventional milieu of her job as an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. At times her friend Auden, considered by many the best poet writing in English in the 20th century, even invited her students to tea.         Through Mr. Kallman, who was about her age, Ms. Farnan met his father, Eddie, whom she eventually married.         Edward Mendelson, a Columbia University professor and Auden's literary executor, said in an interview on Thursday that ''Auden in Love'' (Simon & Schuster, 1984) was important because it made it possible to understand the Auden-Kallman relationship, which endured for 34 years, ''in ways that would have been impossible without it.''         The book progresses from the time when the poet, then 32, met Mr. Kallman, a brilliant college student of 18, and traces the peaks and valleys of their relationship, including an exchange of wedding rings and Auden's murderous rage when he was first betrayed by his mercurial lover. It ends not with Mr. Kallman, a poet and librettist, discovering Auden's corpse in a Vienna hotel in 1973, but with Mr. Kallman's own lonely end just 15 months later.         Ms. Farnan had a special vantage point, and many but not all reviewers said she gave an unexpectedly detailed, intimate and accurate view of Auden's private life. ''What she remembered corresponded to things she could not have looked up,'' Professor Mendelson said.         The book oozes gossip, and some reviewers criticized this quality, including Julian Symons, writing in The Times Literary Supplement in London in 1985. Nevertheless, Mr. Symons said the book was an important addition to what he termed ''the Auden biographical corpus.''         Ms. Farnan argued that past Auden biographies had understated the importance of the Kallman relationship, and in so doing had ''discounted most of all Auden's need to love.'' She included a previously unknown Auden poem in the form of a letter written on Christmas Day 1941, in which the events of the Nativity are given outrageous counterparts in the relationship between Auden and Mr. Kallman.         It reads, in part:         Because mothers have much to do with your queerness and mine, because we have both lost ours, and because Mary is a camp name;         As this morning I think of Mary I think of you.         Dorothy Jeanne-Therese Farnan was born on June 29, 1919, in Winona, Minn., the only child of James Farnan, a lawyer, and the former Nanneta Von Starck. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in English from the University of Michigan, where in 1941 she met Mr. Kallman, a graduate student, ''young, blond and deliciously arrogant,'' in her words.         Mr. Kallman had met Auden in 1939 at a poetry reading in New York. The book's most memorable theme is Auden's determination to remain faithful to Mr. Kallman, even support him financially, as the younger man broke his heart again and again.         ''Chester fell in love for the first time again'' is a phrase that repeats through Ms. Farnan's narrative.         Mr. Kallman and Auden were living together in Michigan when Ms. Farnan met Mr. Kallman, and through him, Auden. Then she moved to Manhattan and lost track of both of them, until Mr. Kallman tapped her shoulder one day at the Waldorf Cafeteria. Soon, she and her best friend, Mary Valentine, were living a life of laughter and ideas, centered in Greenwich Village, revolving around Mr. Kallman, and liberally lubricated with wine of often dubious quality.         ''Those years with Auden, there was a sense of them being golden years,'' the Rev. Carla Valentine Pryne, Mary Valentine's daughter, Ms. Farnan's goddaughter and an Episcopal minister, said in an interview on Thursday.         Ms. Farnan fell in love with Mr. Kallman's father, Eddie, and married him -- ''somewhat illegally,'' she wrote in her book -- in 1948. After the death of Eddie's actual wife, they were legally married in 1975. He died in 1986.         Meanwhile, Ms. Farnan -- a very tall woman with naturally platinum hair, a penchant for rescuing stray cats and a passion for the Latin Mass -- was gradually rising in the New York City public school system. In 1986, she became the first woman to be head of the English department at Erasmus.         Veronica Warren, her successor in that job and now an assistant principal in New Jersey, recalled on Thursday how tough Ms. Farnan's standards were: even remedial-reading students had to study eight Shakespeare plays in their four years of high school.         ''She refused to believe that every student couldn't learn the classics,'' Ms. Warren said in an interview. ''She even considered American literature inferior.''         In her book, Ms. Farnan mentioned that she was only heeding Auden's advice: ''They don't need a paid teacher to learn to read Hemingway,'' he had told her.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 2 about Dorothy Farnan, a New York City teacher who wrote ''Auden in Love,'' a book about W. H. Auden and his companion, Chester Kallman, misstated the year in which she became chairman of the English department at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. It was 1966, not 1986.       
         Christabel Burton Bielenberg, a well-born Englishwoman who wrote a best-selling memoir about saving her German husband, a Nazi resister, from the Gestapo, died on Sunday at the family's home in rural Ireland. She was 94.         Her book, ''The Past Is Myself,'' published in 1968, was a runaway success and a Book of the Month Club selection as ''Ride Out the Dark'' (Norton, 1971). It formed the basis for a four-part television drama, called ''Christabel,'' written by Dennis Potter and starring Elizabeth Hurley, which was shown in this country on ''Masterpiece Theater'' on public television in 1989.         Beautiful, headstrong and born to privilege in London, Mrs. Bielenberg spurned a scholarship at Oxford to study opera in Hamburg, Germany, where she fell in love with a dashing law student, Peter Bielenberg. They married in 1934, as Hitler came to power in Berlin. Ignoring advice to move to neutral Ireland, they stayed as he pursued his career as a lawyer and civil servant and their family grew.         Their social circle comprised people who initially rejected Hitler's Nazis as boors and were too late to grasp the true dimensions of the horror that befell Europe. For the Bielenbergs, the moment of truth came when a close friend, Adam von Trott, took part in plotting the attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20, 1944, for which he was hanged.         By January, Peter Bielenberg, suspected of complicity, was being held in a brig for recalcitrant S.S. men at Ravensbrück concentration camp. His wife pulled all the stops, using her well-connected British upbringing to plead for her husband at Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.         As a result, he was spared from being shipped to the eastern front. He was sent to a punishment battalion but escaped to a refuge in the Black Forest, where the Bielenbergs awaited the end of hostilities. After the war, Peter Bielenberg was the first German to receive a postwar visa to Britain.         Christabel Bielenberg reclaimed her British citizenship and, using her connections, returned to Germany briefly as a correspondent for The Observer. But the couple settled in Ireland in 1948, and she eventually became an Irish citizen.         The Bielenbergs bought a decrepit farm, which they nursed to profitability. They lived quietly without dwelling on their wartime experiences until asked to help with a book about Mr. Trott. That prompted Mrs. Bielenberg to start one of her own. It remains in print as ''When I Was a German, 1934-1945: An Englishwoman in Nazi Germany'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2000).         Peter Bielenberg died in 2001. Christabel Bielenberg is survived by their three sons, Nicholas, John and Christopher.         Hailing from a politically involved family, she acknowledged that it was odd for her even in Hitler's Germany not to have spoken out early on.         ''But it's true that we didn't protest soon enough about Hitler,'' she told an interviewer during the filming of ''Christabel.'' ''We just didn't know what had hit us. You read about horrors in the newspapers, but you don't really wake up to them until they touch you personally.''       
         Ann Sunstein Kheel, a civic leader and environmentalist whose posts included chairwoman of the State Parks Commission for the City of New York, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Center in Manhattan, her family said. She was 88 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.         Her husband is Theodore W. Kheel, the labor mediator and lawyer. They married in 1937, the year after she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell. A native of Pittsburgh, Mrs. Kheel was a journalist and government information specialist and later became prominent in civic affairs. She was chairwoman of the State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Commission for the City of New York from 1977-86.         Active in the New York Urban League since the mid-1960's, she was the secretary of its board until 1990 and the founder of its annual Frederick Douglass Awards Dinner; she was the dinner's chairwoman from 1966 to 1990. She was also a former trustee of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. In public education, she spent years on panels like the Cooperative Education Commission of the City Board of Education. She was also a trustee of the nonprofit Rainforest Alliance.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kheel's survivors include five daughters, Ellen Jacobs of Manhattan; Constance E. Kheel of Buskirk, N.Y.; Dr. Marti Kheel of El Cerrito, Calif.; Jane K. Stanley of Bethesda, Md.; and Katherine K. Fleischman of Baltimore; a son, Robert J., of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.
