         Dorothy Maynor, a highly regarded soprano recitalist who founded the Harlem School of the Arts, died on Monday at the Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. She was 85 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.         Miss Maynor, whose career helped open the way for black artists like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, possessed a voice that the New Grove Dictionary of  American Music describes as "a soaring, belllike soprano capable of exquisite musical effects, supported by a sincere and ardent temperament." She took New York by storm in a sold-out recital at Town Hall in 1939 and pursued a successful recital career.         Although she committed more than 100 operatic roles to memory, she never appeared on an opera stage; there were no such opportunities for a black artist  in the late 1930's and the 1940's, when she was in her prime. (Miss Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, did not make her debut there until 1955.)         Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk, Va., and as a child she sang in the choir of her father's church. She entered Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va., intending to become a teacher of home economics, but she also joined the renowned Hampton Choir, with which she toured Europe in 1929. On the  advice of the choir director, R. Nathaniel Dett, she changed her major to music  and earned a bachelor's degree in 1933.         After being awarded a scholarship, she studied choir direction at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., where she received a second bachelor's degree in music and choral conducting in 1935. While on tour in New England with the school's choir, she was encouraged by several wealthy benefactors to pursue a concert career. Three years of private study in New York followed, with Wilfried Klamroth and John Alan Haughton. At this time she changed the spelling of her name from Mainor.         After hearing her sing at the 1939 Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood in western Massachusetts, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky reportedly jumped up  and down, shouting: "It is a miracle! It is a musical revelation! The world must hear her!" Koussevitzky, who called Miss Maynor "a native Flagstad," immediately used her in recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.         She made her formal debut at Town Hall in Manhattan later that year, on Nov.  19, in a widely anticipated event that was sold out more than a week in advance. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, hailed her as "one of the most remarkable soprano voices of the rising generation," called her voice "phenomenal for its range, character and varied expressive resources."         Miss Maynor began touring extensively in the United States, often appearing as a soloist with leading orchestras. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1940 with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by John Barbirolli. In the late 40's she toured Latin America and Europe. She often performed at benefits to aid the  war effort and black causes.         She sang at the Presidential Inaugural galas for Harry S. Truman in 1949 and  Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In 1952, by special permission of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she appeared as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra at Constitution Hall in the first commercial appearance there by a black artist since Miss Anderson had been barred from performing at the hall in  1939. (Miss Anderson subsequently gave benefit performances at the hall.)         Miss Maynor recorded popular arias and songs for RCA Victor. Although she never appeared on the opera stage, she recorded the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" under Arturo Toscanini.         In 1963, she retired to work with her husband, the Rev. Shelby Rooks, at St.  James Presbyterian Church at West 141st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, where he was pastor. That year she founded the Harlem School of the Arts. The school offered classes in music, ballet, modern dance, drama and art to poor children for minimal fees, sometimes as little as 50 cents a lesson, and lent or rented instruments to students who did not own one.         "In most schools, if you don't have a piano, you can't take lessons," Miss Maynor told one interviewer. "But we say, 'Good, you come here and practice.' "  She served as executive director of the school until 1979 and also taught there. In 1977 she raised more than $2 million to build a new facility for the school,  which originally served 20 children and now has more than 1,000 students.         "What I dream of is changing the image held by the children," she said on another occasion. "We've made them believe everything beautiful is outside the community. We would like them to make beauty in our community."         Her work with the school is recounted in "Dorothy Maynor and the Harlem School of the Arts: The Diva and the Dream" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1993), by William F. Rogers Jr.         She received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, Carnegie-Mellon University and Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C..         In 1975, she became the first black member of the Metropolitan Opera board.         She is survived by her husband.         Correction:  March 2, 1996, Saturday         An obituary last Saturday about the soprano Dorothy Maynor credited her with  one recording incorrectly. She did not record the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" with Toscanini.       
         Barbara Howes, a poet who was one of five finalists for the National Book Award in poetry last year for her book "Collected Poems 1945-1990," died in her  sleep early yesterday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington,  Vt. She was 81 and lived on a farm in Pownal, Vt.         She died after a long illness, said her son Gregory Jay Smith.         Miss Howes, who was also a short-story writer, essayist, translator and editor, was the author of eight books of poetry and was a finalist for the poetry award in two earlier years.         Her "Collected Poems 1945-1990" (University of Arkansas Press, 1995) was praised in December by Robert Richman, the poetry editor of The New Criterion, in a review in The New York Times Book Review.         He applauded her "formal adeptness and lyric skill" and her "ability to sketch domestic scenes," but he said her "real calling card" was her knack for "extreme-but-just" metaphors. He called them reminiscent of the English poet John Donne and others of the group of 17th-century English lyric poets known as  the metaphysical poets.         In one poem in the 1995 collection, "The Lost Girl," Miss Howes likened a field to a decade. In another, she described a cat as "mysterious as gauze."         That collection also contains the following lines, which Miss Howes wrote in  praise of the intellect, and which led Mr. Richman to write that "few celebrate mind better":         Mind has mattered so much, and knowledge         Is bottomless as the golden bowl         In the myth, ceaseless as light, grave,         Unemptiable as the sea. . . .         To know, to understand         Has been my passion and addiction.         Miss Howes was born in New York, adopted into a well-to-do Massachusetts family and reared chiefly in a suburb of Boston, Chestnut Hill, where she attended Beaver Country Day School. She graduated from Bennington College in Vermont in 1937. While she was a student, she sought, and learned, the identity  of her natural parents and found that her ancestors included Anne Bradstreet, the 17th-century American poet.         After college, Miss Howes worked briefly for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union in Mississippi and then lived in Greenwich Village and edited a literary magazine, Chimera, from 1943 to 1947.         In 1947 she married the poet William Jay Smith, and the couple lived for a time in England and Italy. They divorced in the mid-1960's, and she lived in Pownal for the rest of her life. For the past three decades, she mainly lived a  secluded life on her farm.         She did spend time in the Caribbean though, and she edited two anthologies of writings by authors from lands to the south of the United States: "From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean" (1966) and "The Eye of the Heart: Short Stories From Latin America" (Avon, 1973).         Jorge Luis Borges, the Argentine poet, critic and short-story writer who died in 1986, said of "The Eye of the Heart," "All the important writers are there, and the stories are all good."         Miss Howes also wrote "The Road Commissioner and Other Stories" (1983). Her other poetry books are "The Undersea Farmer" (1948), "In the Cold Country" (1954), "Light and Dark" (University Press of New England, 1959), "Looking up at Leaves" (1966), "The Blue Garden" (University Press of New England, 1972), "A Private Signal: Poems New and Selected" (1977) and "Moving" (Elysian, 1983).         Looking at her work, the poet Richard Wilbur said not long ago, "Some of her  poems have the tartness of up-country New England, yet she can speak fantastically, to evoke the fantastic clamors of New York; and in many a southerly poem, she speaks, for our pleasure, the tongue of pure felicity."         In addition to her son Gregory, of Pownal, Miss Howes is survived by another  son, David Smith of Manhattan and a sister, Priscilla Howes Grant of Middlebury, Vt.       
         One of the most elegant tennis players ever to grace a grass court, Sarah Palfrey Danzig, a mainstay on the international circuit in the 1930's and an esteemed ambassador of the game thereafter, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 83.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband, Jerry A. Danzig, said.         In addition to being active in the Boston social registry from the 1930's to the 50's, she and her four sisters all claimed national tennis titles at varying points of their lives. But she was the only member of the brood who continued to have a significant impact on the tennis scene upon making the transition from junior to the adult ranks.         In all, Danzig collected 18 Grand Slam titles, most of them in doubles where, because of her uncommon artistry around the net, she was a coveted partner in women's as well as mixed doubles competitions. And her beatific courtside manner made her a favorite with spectators in the United States and abroad, where she garnered 24 titles.         Danzig was born in Sharon, Mass., on Sept. 18, 1912. Early on, she received the attention and instruction of Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman, the progenitor of the international Wightman Cup competition between teams from the United States and  Britain, and a front-runner in making the volley an essential component of women's tennis.         As a result of that association, Danzig not only excelled at the net, but she was also selected to be a member of 10 Wightman Cup teams. Her doubles partners  there -- Helen Jacobs, Helen Wills Moody and Alice Marble -- constituted a veritable Who's Who of women's tennis.         The United States National champion in singles in 1941 and again in 1945, Danzig ranked among the world's top 10 women on six occasions between 1933 and '39. She was the United States doubles champion nine times and captured the Wimbledon doubles title, alongside the equally glamorous Marble, in 1938 and '39.         Danzig rose to prominence on the national scene as a teen-ager. At 14, she won the Junior Grass Court Doubles in 1927 and she began dominating both singles and doubles junior events the following year. By the time she acquired her last  amateur national title in 1945 at a doubles clay-court championship where her partner was Elwood Cooke, the second of her three husbands, Danzig possessed a total of 63 national titles.         "Sarah certainly had all the elements of grace and charm and played a very stylish game," said Virginia Wade, the 1977 Wimbledon champion, who benefited from Danzig's support while still a rookie. "She always treated newcomers to the game as if they were one of the family, and she was a wonderful role model,"         Danzig briefly turned professional in 1947 for an exhibition tour with Pauline Betz before switching her attention to a business career in which she also thrived. Besides performing charitable duties on a revolving list of social committees, Danzig worked for NBC television as a sports editor from 1956 to '57, and in 1965 became an advertising consultant for World Tennis magazine.         Her method for attracting advertising to the magazine was unique and ahead of its time. Instead of wooing corporate clients with the traditional martini luncheon, the health-conscious Danzig booked weekly court time at a mid-Manhattan facility and supervised vigorous tennis matches among writers, editors and business executives. She herself played recreational tennis well into her 70's.         The author of two instructional tennis books, "Winning Tennis and How to Play It" (1946) and "Tennis for Anyone" (1966), Danzig was elected to the sport's Hall of Fame in 1963. This year, a permanent exhibit in her honor will be incorporated into its collection.         She is survived by her husband and two children, Diana Dupont of Hudson, N.H., and Jerry P., of New York, and two sisters, Polly Woodrow of San Jose, Calif., and Joanna Brown of Canton, Mass.       
         Bernice Lotwin Bernstein, a former New York regional director of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, died on Wednesday at the Group Health Hospital in Seattle. She was 87 and had moved to Seattle from the Upper East Side of Manhattan eight months ago.         She was appointed director of Region 2, which covered New York and New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, in 1966. She was responsible for evaluating H.E.W. programs in her jurisdiction of 30 million people.         She also supervised the operations of the Health Services and Mental Health  Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Education, the Social and Rehabilitation Service, the Office of Child Development and the Food  and Drug Administration.         Mrs. Bernstein retired as director in 1977 and worked as a special assistant  to Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. for more than a year longer.         From then until her death, she served as a director of the Non-Governmental Committee on Aging at the United Nations.         She was a past president of the Federal Business Association in New York and  chairman of the Federal Regional Council. She was active in the National Council of Jewish Women as a member of the national board and executive committee and national treasurer.         Born in Menomonie, Wis., she was a philosophy graduate of the University of Wisconsin, from which she received a doctorate in 1932 from the Law School. She  took up public service the next year as an attorney for the National Recovery Administration.         Mrs. Bernstein is survived by three daughters, Elinor B. Balka of Forest Hills, Queens, Kate L. Bernstein of Manhattan, and Anne L. Bernstein of Seattle; a sister, Alice Lotwin of Peoria, Ill., and three grandchildren. Her husband of  52 years, Bernard, died in 1990.       
         Professor Jean Margaret Maxwell, who helped establish the New York School of  Social Work at New York University in the 1950's and the San Diego State University School of Social Work in the 1960's, died on Feb. 22 at the Casa de Manana retirement community in San Diego. She was 81.         Ms. Maxwell, who was professor emeritus at San Diego State, worked in various positions at the National Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers in  New York from 1944 to 1953, when she joined with other new faculty members at N.Y.U. to organize the social work school. She was its associate director and department head until 1958.         Partly because of her experience at N.Y.U., San Diego State recruited her in 1963 to help establish its School of Social Work. At the time, the California State University system was also creating social work schools at its Sacramento, San Francisco, Fresno and San Jose campuses.         Professor Maxwell later became associate dean at San Diego and taught as a full professor. She retired in 1979.         An expert on aging, settlement houses and social work education, she worked from 1959 to 1961 with the Committee on Aging of the National Social Welfare Assembly, a planning and coordinating body for social welfare agencies. She was  also a founder of the Council of Social Work Education, a successor to the American Association of Schools of Social Work. The council served as the first  liaison between the schools and social service agencies in the field.         Ms. Maxwell was born in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of Minnesota, where she also did graduate work at the School of Social Work. She received a master's degree in administration from the Case Western Reserve School of Social Work in 1941.       
         Frieda Sandberg Lewis, a champion of Jewish causes and past national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Feb. 29 in Deerfield Beach, Fla. She was 85, and a former resident of Great Neck, L.I., and Manhattan.         Mrs. Lewis's association with Hadassah went back four decades. She served as  national vice president and treasurer and headed its Nassau and Suffolk region as well as a number of its divisions. She was national president from 1980 to 1984. During her tenure, she presided over the creation of Hadassah International, which now has branches in some 30 countries.         She also held leadership positions in Jewish international affairs. She was  a past chairwoman of the American section of the World Jewish Congress and head  of its global commission on anti-Semitism for North America.         She was a life board member of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a trustee of the American Friends of Hebrew University. Recently, she was a member of the  executive and national board of the American Zionist Federation and sat on the presidium of the Zionist General Council.         Mrs. Lewis was active in a number of other organizations, including the American Foundation for Jewish Culture, the advisory board of the National Jewish Family Center of the American Jewish, the United States and New York Holocaust Commissions, the Synagogue Council of America and the World Synagogue  Council.         She was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Adelphi University.         Mrs. Lewis is survived by her husband of 65 years, Edward Lewis; two sons, Dr. Jeffrey Lewis of Armonk, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Lewis of Nashville, Tenn.; a  sister, Beatrice Smith of Franklin Square, L.I., and nine grandchildren.       
         Lila Perlstein of Roslyn Heights, L.I., a top bridge player, died yesterday in North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 70 and had cancer, said her son, Jay Perlstein of Pleasantville, N.Y.         Mrs. Perlstein was already ill last year when she placed 16th in the American Contract Bridge League's National Player of the Year standings. She was second among female players, behind a regular partner, Juanita Chambers of Schenectady, N.Y. They won the National Women's Pair Championship in Phoenix in March, and, with others, the National Women's Knockout Team Championship in Atlanta in August.         Mrs. Perlstein won many regional titles and was second in the National Women's Teams in 1976. At one time she was co-owner of the North Shore Bridge Club in Roslyn Heights.         Mrs. Perlstein was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Cornell University in  1945. She is survived by her son and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Jane Marion Oppenheimer, a biologist and science historian whose interests ranged from embryos to the physiological effects of weightlessness in  space, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia after a brief illness. She was 84.         She retired in 1980 as the Kenan Professor Emeritus of Biology and History of Science at Bryn Mawr College, where she had taught and done research for more than four decades. But she continued to teach, write, edit and experiment for several more years and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  in 1992 in recognition of her contributions.         Many of Dr. Oppenheimer's scientific papers dealt with experimental embryology, the history of embryology, the development of the central nervous system of fishes and the history of science, particularly 18th-century medicine  in Britain.         Among her books were "Essays in the History of Embryology and Biology" (1967) and "Foundations of Experimental Embryology" (2d edition, 1974). She also edited the English version, in 1986, of "The Autobiography of Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876)," about a German-born doctor and anthropologist who had doubts about Darwin's approach to evolution.         She created one of four American scientific experiments done aboard a Soviet  satellite in the first American-Soviet space venture. Using killifish, a small bony junkfish, she helped analyze the effects of weightlessness on the physiology of fish eggs at five stages of their evolution. The work brought her awards from the two nations in 1975: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Achievement Award and the Soviet Kosmos Award.         Dr. Oppenheimer also won the Wilbur Cross Medal from the Yale Graduate Alumni Association. She was a president of the American Society of Zoologists and an officer in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         Born in Philadelphia, she was a 1936 graduate of Bryn Mawr and earned a Ph.D. in zoology at Yale University. She returned to Bryn Mawr as an instructor in 1938.         She leaves no immediate family.       
         Margaret Rockefeller, who worked on behalf of farmland conservation, the American Farmland Trust, the New York Botanical Garden and the New York Philharmonic, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 80 and the wife of David Rockefeller, former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         The cause was complications from heart surgery, a family spokesman said.         Although she served on numerous boards and was involved in fund raising for  a number of projects, Mrs. Rockefeller, who was known as Peggy, maintained a low profile, preferring to remain in the background and devoting much of her time to causes that were more worthy than fashionable.         Particularly concerned with agricultural issues and the environment, she was  a founding board member of the American Farmland Trust and the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, serving as chairman for many years. She was also a member of the Nature Conservancy and the National Historic Trust.         In the mid-1970's, Mrs. Rockefeller began to buy and raise cattle, first on Bartlett Island in Maine, near the Rockefeller summer home in Seal Harbor, and then at Pocantico, the family home in Tarrytown, N.Y. In 1980, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller bought four farms in western Columbia County, N.Y., where Mrs. Rockefeller became an accomplished farmer, raising purebred Simmental cattle.         "I always loved the country, farming and animals," she said in an interview with The New York Times soon after the purchase of the Columbia County farms. She read all she could about farmland preservation until "little by little, I was trapped," she said         In 1992, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller announced an agreement with the American Farmland Trust and the Columbia County Land Conservancy that would place under protection for perpetuity almost 2,000 acres of their Hudson River Valley property.         Mrs. Rockefeller made substantial contributions to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the New York Philharmonic and was a trustee from 1953 to 1970.         Mrs. Rockefeller was also a member of the Board of Managers of the New York Botanical Garden. She came up with the idea for and helped finance the garden's  series of six illustrated books on America's wildflowers. She organized the National Committee for the Wild Flowers of the United States, which raised some  $500,000 for the project.         In 1988, Mrs. Rockefeller opened the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden, a two-acre enclave of some 2,700 roses. The restoration of the original 1915 garden designed by Beatrix Jones Farrand was supported by a $1 million gift from Mr. Rockefeller.         Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller received the Pillar of New York Award, given by the  Preservation League of New York State, last fall.         The daughter of Francis Sims and Neva van Zandt Smith McGrath, Mrs. Rockefeller was born in New York and grew up in Mount Kisco. She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and the Chapin School in New York. She met her future husband in the early 1930's and they were married in 1940 in Bedford, N.Y. The couple celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary last September.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six children, David Jr., Abby  Rockefeller and Neva Goodwin, all of Masschusetts; Peggy Dulany of New York, Dr. Richard of Maine, and Eileen Growald of California; a brother, Sims McGrath of Tenants Harbor, Me., and 10 grandchildren.         Correction:  March 28, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Margaret Rockefeller, conservationist and philanthropist, misidentified the museum of which her husband, David Rockefeller, is chairman emeritus. It is the Museum of Modern Art, not the Metropolitan Museum.       
         Ethlyne Clair, who starred in silent comedies, westerns and serials, died on  Tuesday at Tarzana Hospital here. She was 91.         Ms. Clair was popular in movie westerns in the 1920's, although her career was less than a decade long. She made three films with Hoot Gibson, whom she later called her favorite actor.         She made her Hollywood debut in a series of comedies called "The Newlyweds and Their Baby." Her national reputation was boosted by two serials, "The Vanishing Rider" in 1928 and "Queen of the Northwoods" in 1929. Her last film was "God's Gift to Women" in 1931.         She is survived by two daughters, Lynne Westmore Bloom and Merle Ann Frost Wybenga; three sons, Merle, John and Christopher Frost; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         M. Shanara Gilbert, an associate professor of law at the City University of New York Law School at Queens College, was killed on Tuesday in a highway accident in South Africa. She was 45 and lived in Brooklyn.         The accident, in which the school's former dean, W. Haywood Burns, also died, occurred when a truck ran a red light near Cape Town and struck the car in which they were riding, university officials said. They were attending a conference on democracy and international law.         Ms. Gilbert, a graduate of Syracuse University in political journalism, was  a founder and co-director of the City University Law School's Defender Clinic, a member of the board of directors of the National Conference of Black Lawyers and past chairwoman of the conference's Section on Criminal Justice. After receiving a J.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in 1980, she worked as a staff lawyer with the District of Columbia Public Defender Service and the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services.         Ms. Gilbert, who was born in Gap, Pa., worked for legal aid agencies well before becoming a lawyer, and was on the advisory board of the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem. In 1993, as a consultant to the Ford Foundation, she wrote a report on the status of university legal aid clinics in South Africa.         She is survived by her companion, Wayne Walcott, and two aunts, Alberta Davis of Newark and Mildred White of Philadelphia.       
         Ariel Allen, a senior advertising executive for the Colgate-Palmolive Company, died on April 7 in New York. She was 58.         The cause of death was cancer, the company said.         Miss Allen joined the Ted Bates advertising agency in 1960 to work on the Colgate account.         She then moved to the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency, still working on the Colgate account. In 1971, she joined Colgate as vice president for creative services, developing television commercials with various advertising agencies.         In 1992, she assumed major responsibilities for the company's television advertising around the world as vice president for creative services in global advertising.         In 1988, the trade publication Advertising Age named her to its "100 of the Best and Brightest Women in Advertising" list and in 1989, Business Week included her in its list of "Women in Corporate America to Watch."         She had served as a chairman of the American Advertising Federation National  Convention.         Miss Allen is survived by her mother, Shirley Adsit, and her sister, Louisa Brownell.       
         Bernice Hanft Shepard, a professional social worker who founded a private-care agency for the home-bound and elderly in Manhattan, died on Monday  at her home on the Upper East Side. She was 74.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said a friend, Betsy Flagler.         Ms. Shepard was the founder and president of Shepard Personal Services, which she managed for 16 years until illness caused her to sell the company last year.         She attended Brooklyn College and worked as a statistician for a Jewish philanthropy. At age 58, she received a master's degree in social work from Hunter College and worked in the field of alcohol abuse.         She then joined Search and Care, a neighborhood group providing services for  people who were able to finance their own care. Out of this grew her idea of a business that could offer expert personal care. Colleagues noted that she took a personal interest in her clients.         She helped establish a local chapter of the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers and advised newcomers to the field. For several years, she taught courses related to aging at Yeshiva University.         Ms. Shepard is survived by a son, Steven Hanft of Arlington, Va.; a daughter, Laura Korobkin of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Katharine Gladys Kaufman Smith, a philanthropist and longtime leader of civil rights and peace groups on Long Island, died on May 4 at her home in Riverdale,  Md. She was 104.         Mrs. Smith was so active in antiwar activities during the Vietnam War that peace groups had the run of her house for meetings and other official uses and for fund-raisers.         Out of respect for her support, a local antiwar group adopted her surname, calling itself the Peacesmiths. Three years ago, when she moved to a daughter's  house in Maryland, she deeded her Long Island home, known as Peacesmith House, to the Long Island Progressive Coalition.         In the 1950's, she donated part of her property for the main branch of the Massapequa Public Library.         Mrs. Smith was born in Milbank, S.D., and received a degree in geology from the University of Washington in 1917. That year, she married Warren Smith, a geologist. He died in 1965.         In 1919 they moved to Massapequa, where they reared seven children. In 1934,  she took a social work job with the Nassau County Emergency Relief Bureau, and four years later she joined what was then the new Nassau County Department of Social Services, from which she retired in 1962.         But she was as devoted to politics as to her profession, running in 1931 as a Socialist Party candidate for the State Assembly. For decades, her house was a frequent meeting place for civil rights groups, antiwar groups and socialists. She was active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy and the American Civil Liberties Union.         She is survived by five children, Katherine Schwarz of San Mateo, Calif., Esther Nichols of Riverdale, Md., Warren Smith of Placerville, Calif., Laura Quigley of Bozeman, Mont., and Jacqueline Cleaver of Medford Lakes, N.J.; 22 grandchildren, 31 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Olga Marie Madar, who rose to the top echelon in the United Automobile Workers and fought for women's rights in the labor movement, died on Thursday at her home in Detroit. She was 80.         The cause was heart failure, the union said.         Ms. Madar achieved several firsts for women in a union career that spanned 62 years. With pressure from restive female members and the support of Walter P. Reuther, the union's president, she was in 1966 the first woman to take a seat on the union's board.         She was also the first woman to be elected an international vice president of the union, in 1970. And she was the founding national president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women in 1974. She retired as an officer of the union in 1974 but remained active in retiree affairs until last year.         She was born in Sykesville, Pa., one of 12 children of a coal miner and grocer who moved the family to Detroit in search of work when she was 15. In 1933, she found a summer job on a Chrysler assembly line.         Years later she recalled that the line moved so fast she could "never keep up" and had nightmares about it. She said she was apparently kept on the job because of her citywide reputation as a terror on the women's softball team.         "There was no union at the plant then," she said, "and the fact that they would hire me when other workers were being laid off -- just because I could play softball -- was incredible. It was my first indication that a union was badly needed."         She remained an advocate for women, aware that women rarely worked more than  two or three days a week and were the last hired and first fired. Working summers, she graduated from Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti in 1938 with a degree in physical education.         She reached her first milestone as a unionist in 1947 when she became the director of the recreation department at the auto workers union. She was elected to the policy-setting board at the union convention in 1966.         She joined Reuther in squashing a notion that labor should chart its own political course rather than stick to its alliance with the Democrats. .         Unhappiness among female union members with their lack of power within the unions led to the formation in 1974 of the Coalition of Labor Union Women.         Ms. Madar was also active in civic affairs, working with national organizations with programs to improve parks and recreation centers in the inner cities. She also acted to give citizens access to decision-making in that area.         The union said it had no immediate word on survivors.       
         Mary Perot Nichols, the strong-willed former head of the television and radio stations operated by New York City, and a former columnist and city editor of The Village Voice, died yesterday in the hospice of the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her family said.         A friend and ally of Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, for 40 years, Ms. Nichols twice served as president of the WNYC Communications Group, with two radio stations, WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM, and a television station, WNYC-TV, Channel  31, licensed and partly financed by the city.         Ms. Nichols's most lasting professional contribution may have been the creation of the WNYC Foundation in the late 1970's, founded to attract private funds so the communications group could survive despite dwindling city financing. The foundation is awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission to buy WNYC-AM and FM, which are to remain public stations. Last week, the F.C.C. cleared the way for the city to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to the ITT Corporation and Dow Jones, which plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation.         Under Ms. Nichols's leadership, the radio station became an important contributor to the city's cultural life and a major producer of programs for National Public Radio, including "Kids America," a live call-in program for children that won several broadcasting awards.         Mayor Koch first appointed Ms. Nichols to head WNYC Communications in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, when budget-conscious politicians called  for sale of the stations. She not only kept them going but also began station renovations.         When she resigned after two years to become director of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she tossed off a tart farewell: doing creative work  for the city-owned stations was, she said, "a little like trying to cook a gourmet meal with glue on the kitchen floor."         Ms. Nichols left WNYC because of a disagreement with Mayor Koch when he insisted that the radio station run "The John Hour," in which the names of nine  men convicted of patronizing prostitutes were read over WNYC-AM. Mr. Koch theorized that the embarrassing exposure would cut into the prostitution trade and also argued that the Mayor should be allowed to control programming. "The John Hour" ran only once, but there was an outcry, and Ms. Nichols was made "uncomfortable," Mr. Koch said.         But he wooed her back to lead the communications group from 1983 to 1990, when Mayor David N. Dinkins replaced her with his own choice. She then became a  visiting professor of journalism at New York University, a post she held until her death.         Born in York, Pa., Mary Perot grew up near Philadelphia and in Buffalo. Friends say her Main Line family offered her a choice: she could have a "coming-out tea" or a college education. She selected college and in 1948 graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science.         She lived with her husband and three children in Greenwich Village, and was involved in local issues, particularly the effort to stop Robert Moses from putting a road through Washington Square Park. She kept nudging Dan Wolf, a founding editor of The Village Voice, to write about the park. He encouraged her to write about the danger to the park herself, and she did.         Soon she became a mainstay of the young newspaper, first as a reporter, then  as author of "Runnin' Scared," a column about city politics.         A competitive writer with a streak of indignation -- "Mary had the kind of anger that made abolitionists," said a former colleague, Jerry Tallmer, the writer -- she wrote extensively about organized crime and political corruption and was among the loudest critics of the Lower Manhattan Expressway and then Westway. Neither was built.         "Mary had spies everywhere," said Clark Whelton, a former Voice reporter who  is now a speechwriter for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "She seemed to know things  other people never found out. She would do the legwork herself, sit through long meetings, read documents nobody else would read, make connections nobody else would make."         Before she left the paper for good in the mid-1970's, she took two years off  to serve as a public relations aide in the city's Parks Department. It was a heady time, during Mayor John V. Lindsay's first term, and the energetic Parks Commissioner, Thomas P. F. Hoving, staged happenings -- concerts and other events to draw the public to the once placid parks.         "In the revolution of 1966, Mary was a key player," said Henry Stern, the current Commissioner of the Parks Department who was then its executive director. "Hoving was brand new to city government, but she knew all about it. He got the nickname Thomas P. F. Hoving, P. F. for Publicity Forever, but Mary Nichols made it happen."         Ms. Nichols soon grew disillusioned with Mr. Hoving and Mr. Lindsay, who became one of many favorite targets in her columns once she returned to The Voice in 1968.         As The Voice's city editor, she encouraged young writers and seemed to thrive on feuds with politicians and colleagues. Some accused her of trying to promote  the interests of Mr. Koch, her old friend. She acknowledged that she often agreed with him, but asserted that "when I disagreed with him, I let him have it."         Shortly after The Voice's founders sold it in the mid-1970's, a new editor dismissed Ms. Nichols. In 1977, she became communications director to Mayor Kevin S. White of Boston for just under a year. Then, after Mr. Koch's election  that year, she took on the WNYC job.         Ms. Nichols's marriage to Robert B. Nichols, a writer, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eliza Nichols of Williamsburg, Va., and Kerstin Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; a son, Duncan, of Thetford, Vt.; a brother, Charles Perot, and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Rachel Dunaway Cox, an emeritus professor of education and psychology at  Bryn Mawr College who was a leader in the field of child development, died on April 24 at the Quadrangle, a retirement village in Haverford, Pa. She was 92.         She retired in 1971 after 27 years on the faculty but continued to write and  lecture widely. At her death, she had been working on a 40-year study of the women she had written about in "Youth Into Maturity: A Study of Men and Women in the First 10 Years After College" (Mental Health Materials Center, 1970).         When she arrived at Bryn Mawr in 1944, she was appointed director of its Child Study Institute, which grew to national prominence during her tenure. In cooperation with local school systems, the center evaluated and treated children with educational and developmental problems.         When Dr. Cox started out, children who had trouble keeping up in school were  usually deemed unmotivated or defiant. She raised awareness that such children often suffered from complex impairments.         Dr. Cox was born in Murray, Ky., the daughter of a country doctor who served  as a role model as she accompanied him on his rounds in a horse-drawn buggy. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Texas in 1925, moved to New York and became a reporter at The Herald Tribune only to find herself relegated to "women's news."         Finding teaching more compatible, she received a master of arts degree at Columbia University and a Ph.D. in psychology, education and social work at the  University of Pennsylvania in 1943.         Dr. Cox is survived by a son, David, of Fort Wayne, Ind.; a daughter, Rosemary C. Masters of Manhattan; five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. Her husband of 65 years, Dr. Reavis Cox, died in 1992.       
         Patsy Montana, whose yodeling-cowgirl songs made her a pioneer in country music, died on Friday at her home in San Jacinto, Calif., The Associated Press reported. She was 81.         Ms. Montana had her biggest hit, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," in 1935, the first million-selling hit for a female country singer. It brought an assertive female voice to country music, as she announced her readiness to "rope and ride" and sang whooping high notes. Ms. Montana remained active for a career that lasted six decades.         Ms. Montana, who original name was Rubye Blevins, was born in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, and grew up in Hope, Ark., hearing the music of Jimmie Rodgers, country's "blue yodeler." She moved to California in 1930 with an older brother, and began performing on radio there after winning a talent contest. She joined the revue of a well-known country singer, Stuart Hamblen, in 1931, working with  a group called the Montana Cowgirls; Hamblen renamed her Patsy. She made her first recordings as Patsy Montana in 1932, and in 1933 she moved to Chicago to perform on WLS radio with the Prairie Ramblers.         She appeared regularly on the "National Barn Dance" program and recorded for  the American Record Corporation, usually accompanied by the Ramblers; she relocated with them to WOR radio in Manhattan in 1935. Along with "I Want to Be  a Cowboy's Sweetheart," which she wrote, her hits included "Shy Anne from Old Cheyenne," "The She Buckaroo," "Rodeo Sweetheart" and "I Wanna Be a Western Cowgirl." In 1939, she appeared with Gene Autry in the movie "Colorado Sunset."         During the 1940's, she recorded with the Sons of the Pioneers and the Light Crust Doughboys, and had a hit with "Goodnight, Soldier" during World War II. She returned to Arkansas in 1948, performing on radio there and at the Saturday-night "Louisiana Hayride" in Shreveport, La. When her husband, Paul Rose, was transferred to California, the family moved to the West Coast, and Ms. Montana went into temporary retirement during the 1950's.         But she returned to touring in the 1960's. In 1964, she made an album with a  band that included Waylon Jennings, little known at the time, on lead guitar. In the 1970's and 80's, she made albums for folk and bluegrass labels like Birch, Old Homestead and Flying Fish.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Beverly Losey, both of San Jacinto, and two brothers, Ira Blevins of Mena, Ark., and Kenneth Blevins of Florida.       
         Beatrice Procter Frelinghuysen, the wife of one Congressman and mother of another, who was on the boards of nonprofit organizations in the fields of botany and ballet, died on Monday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J., where she lived. She was 77.         The cause was complications from pneumonia, said her son Peter.         Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a member of a family that has long been prominent in  New Jersey's public life. She was the wife of Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen, a Republican who represented north central New Jersey in the House from 1953 through 1974. He is related to four earlier Frelinghuysens who were United States senators, one of whom, Frederick T., became a Secretary of State under President Chester A. Arthur.         She and her husband had five children, including Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, also a Republican Congressman from north central New Jersey, who was elected in  1994.         At her death, Mrs. Frelinghuysen was on the board of the Berkshire Botanical  Garden in Stockbridge, Mass. In the 1980's, she was on the board of the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii.         In addition, she was for some years a member of the advisory committee of the School of American Ballet, which is part of the Lincoln Center complex.         Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a native of Manhattan, the daughter of Rodney Procter, a stockbroker and investor, and the former Beatrice Sterling.         Besides her husband of 56 years and her sons Peter, of Manhattan, and Rodney, of Morristown, she is survived by another son, Frederick, of Tucson, Ariz.; two  daughters, Beatrice van Roijen of Washington and Adaline Ogilvie-Laing of Manhattan, 13 grandchildren and a sister, Mrs. Anson Phelps Stokes Jr.       
         Kathleen Haberthur-Williams, a theatrical press agent, died on Wednesday in the burn unit of New York University-Cornell Medical Center. She was 41 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was complications of severe burns suffered in an accident at her home on April 27, said Philip Rinaldi, a colleague.         Ms. Haberthur-Williams began her career as a press agent in music and theater in her home town, Detroit, notably at the Chene Park Music Theater. She was also the in-house press agent for the Fisher and Masonic Temple theaters, owned by the Nederlander Organization.         After moving to New York City in 1992, she worked as a press agent for Broadway, Off Broadway and national touring productions, including the 1994 revival of "Medea," "Blood Brothers," "Pounding Nails in the Floor With My Forehead" and "The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me."         From 1993 to 1995, she handled publicity for Here, a performing arts center in SoHo. Most recently, she worked on the national tour of "Ain't Misbehavin',"  with the Pointer Sisters.         She is survived by her husband, Steve Williams; a daughter, Sarah Haberthur;  her parents, Margaret and Charles Buchanan, of Winter Haven, Fla., and three brothers, Charles Buchanan of Winter Haven and Ross and Keith Buchanan, both of  Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Mollie H. Beattie, who resigned as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 6 because of failing health, died on Thursday at Grace  Cottage Hospital in Townsend, Vt. She was 49 and lived in Grafton and Alexandria, Va.         The cause was brain cancer, said a friend, Alexandra M. Marks.         A forester by training, Ms. Beattie was the first woman to head the agency.  In three years as director, she defended the Endangered Species Act against attacks from many Republicans in Congress and fought efforts to reduce the agency's budget, not always successfully.         "In the Clinton Administration, she was probably the strongest single voice for wildlife conservation," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit group that works to protect and preserve species.         Ms. Beattie was a strong proponent of the effort to have gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park for the first time since the 1920's. Mr. Schlickeisen  said one of his most vivid memories of her was seeing her rub cold water on the  belly of a wild wolf at Yellowstone in April to cool it so the animal could be moved to another site for release. Despite the rain in her face, he recalled, she smiled broadly and said, "Any day I can touch a wild wolf is a good day."         As director, she was responsible for the wildlife service's 7,000 employees and an annual budget for resource management of $501 million in the current fiscal year, down from $511 million the previous year. The agency, part of the Interior Department, enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species  Act and carries out wetland protection and management. John Rogers has been serving as acting director.         Ms. Beattie sought to conserve species by managing entire ecosystems rather than waiting until individual species became endangered, and presided over the addition of 15 national wildlife refuges to a system that now has 508.         The agency said that under her direction 140 habitat conservation plans were  established and 300 more were being developed. These plans are formal agreements between landowners and the Fish and Wildlife Service that allow the owners to harm individual members of a species listed as endangered or threatened if they  take steps to help the species as a whole to recover.         She argued that such plans demonstrated that the Endangered Species Act, under which they are carried out, has the flexibility to conserve species while  allowing economic development. In fact, she said, the act "has been one of the biggest success stories of the conservation movement in America," contending that many myths had been spread about the act's supposedly onerous effects.         Just before she resigned, she led efforts to resume the listing of endangered species after a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, which sharply cut the agency's money for such listings in the current fiscal year.         Earlier this month, Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in the House and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in the Senate to name an eight-million-acre wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after her.         Mollie Beattie was born on April 27, 1947, in Glen Cove, L.I. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1968 and a master's degree in forestry at the University of Vermont in 1979. She also received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1991.         She was program director and lands manager for the Windham Foundation, a nonprofit organization that conducts seminars on critical issues facing Vermont, from 1983 to 1985; commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and  Recreation from 1985 to 1989, and deputy secretary of the state's Agency of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1990. She left to become executive director of a  public policy institute, the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government in Vermont, before taking her post at the Fish and Wildlife Service.         She is survived by her husband, Rick Schwolsky of Grafton; her mother, Patricia Beattie of Ketchum, Idaho, and a sister, Jane Beattie, also of Ketchum.       
         Dr. Constance B. Wofsy, a medical professor and clinician who created a program to educate health workers about advances in AIDS treatments, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, according to the University of California at San Francisco, where she was a faculty member. Dr. Wofsy was also co-director of the AIDS Program and associate chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General Hospital.         As co-founder of the hospital's AIDS Program in 1983 with Dr. Paul Volberding, she was influential in providing medical services for young gay men  early in the AIDS epidemic. She also created and directed a program that has attracted hundreds of health professionals to the hospital from around the world to learn about the latest techniques in AIDS care.         Early in the epidemic she recognized that women were at risk and founded an organization in San Francisco called Aware (Association for Women's AIDS Research and Education), which offered confidential testing for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and counseling. It published some of the earliest data on the prevalence of H.I.V. infection in women at high risk in the San Francisco area.         Dr. Wofsy was the founding chairwoman of the Women's Health Committee of the  AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The group oversees and carries out studies of various therapies for AIDS.         She was one of the first AIDS experts to address the issue of workplace discrimination against H.I.V.-infected people, and provided education and training materials on the issue to corporations in San Francisco.         Constance Wofsy was born in Cheltenham, Pa., on Oct. 6, 1942. She earned a bachelor's degree in bacteriology at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964 and a medical degree at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles in 1971. She joined the faculty of the University of California at San Francisco in 1975 and became a full professor in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, David, who is also a medical professor at the university, a son, Kevin, and a daughter, Susan, all of San Francisco, and her mother, Ruth Blitman, of Novato, Calif.       
         Laurel Weiner, a national associate and former national vice president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on June 2 at Portsbridge Hospice in Atlanta. An Atlanta resident, she was 68.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Weiner, a native of Brooklyn, attended the University of Georgia. She devoted most of her spare time to volunteer work for civic organizations and the cause of Zionism. She was a delegate to three World Zionist Congresses and a leader in many national, regional and local Jewish groups.         She was on the board of the Atlanta Community Council and the Community Planning Council. She was also a former president of the Southeast Region of Hadassah.         Mrs. Weiner is survived by her husband, Charles J., a daughter, Toby White, two sons, Barry and Steve, a sister, Miriam Komesar, and a brother, Saul Weinberg, all of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.       
         Ella Fitzgerald, whose sweet, silvery voice and endlessly inventive vocal improvisations made her the most celebrated jazz singer of her generation, died  yesterday at home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         She had been suffering from diabetes and its eyesight and circulatory system  complications for many years. In 1993, both of her legs were amputated below the knees.         A pre-eminent American singer who brought a classic sense of musical proportion and balance to everything she touched, Miss Fitzgerald won the sobriquet "first lady of song" and earned the unqualified admiration of most of  her peers. Musicians from Bing Crosby to Benny Goodman, when asked to name their favorite singer, cited Ella Fitzgerald.         "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest," Crosby once said. Mel Torme hailed her as having "the best ear of any singer ever." Until the 1970's, when physical problems began to impinge on her perfect technique, this hefty, unglamorous woman seemed to loom as an immutable creative force in a musical world where everything else was crumbling.         In a career that spanned six decades, Miss Fitzgerald stood above the emotional fray of the scores of popular standards she performed. Stylistically she was the polar opposite of her equally legendary peer, Billie Holiday, who conveyed a wounded vulnerability. Even when handed a sad song, Miss Fitzgerald communicated a wistful, sweet-natured compassion for the heartache she described.         Where Holiday and Frank Sinatra lived out the dramas they sang about, Miss Fitzgerald, viewing them from afar, seemed to understand and forgive all. Her apparent equanimity and her clear pronunciation, which transcended race, ethnicity, class and age, made her a voice of profound reassurance and hope.         Over the decades, Miss Fitzgerald performed with big bands, symphony orchestras and small jazz groups. Her repertory encompassed show tunes, jazz songs, novelties (like her first major hit, "A-Tisket A-Tasket," recorded in 1938), bossa nova, and even opera ("Porgy and Bess" excerpts, recorded with Louis Armstrong). At her jazziest, her material became a springboard for ever-changing, ebullient vocal inventions, delivered in a sweet, girlish voice that could leap, slide or growl anywhere within a range of nearly three octaves.         Great Diction And Vocal Agility         Miss Fitzgerald was renowned both for her delicately rendered ballads and her pyrotechnical displays of scat improvisation. (The jazz historian Barry Ulanov traced the term be-bop to her spontaneous interpolation of the word "re-bop" in  her 1939 recording of "T'Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It.") She was sometimes criticized for a lack of bluesiness and emotional depth. But her perfect intonation, vocal acrobatics, clear diction and endless store of melodic improvisations -- all driven by powerful rhythmic undercurrents -- brought her nearly universal acclaim.         During her long career, Miss Fitzgerald recorded with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong. Her series of "Songbook" albums, celebrating such songwriters as Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Duke Ellington, helped to elevate the work of the best American songwriters to a stature widely recognized as art song.         "I never knew how good our songs were," Ira Gershwin once said, "until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."         Although most biographies give her birth date as 1918, her birth certificate  and school records show her to have been born a year earlier, on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Va. She was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams Fitzgerald. The couple separated within a year of her birth, and with her mother and a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, she moved to Yonkers.         As a child, Miss Fitzgerald dreamed of being a dancer. But she also sang and  was attracted to the recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and the Boswell  Sisters, in particular the group's lead singer, Connee Boswell.         "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it," she  recalled many years later. "I tried so hard to sound just like her."         As a teen-ager, Miss Fitzgerald developed a dance routine with a friend, Charles Gulliver, which they performed in local clubs. Then in 1932, her mother  died suddenly, and she went to live with an aunt in Harlem.         On Nov. 21, 1934, she made her stage debut in an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater, singing two songs, "The Object of My Affection" and "Judy," in the style of Connee Boswell. She won first prize.         Around this time, she also caught the attention of Chick Webb, the band leader and drummer, who was reluctant to sign her to a contract because she was  gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough," as the band leader Mario Bauza later remembered. But the audience's reaction to her performances persuaded him  to offer her a job, and during the Webb band's residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem her reputation blossomed.         "I thought my singing was pretty much hollering," she recalled many years later, "but Webb didn't."         A Novelty Song Made Her a Star         Miss Fitzgerald made her first recording in 1935 ("Love and Kisses," with Chick Webb), and had her first hit with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," a song she helped  write, adapting the lyric, she later explained, from "that old drop-the-handkerchief game I played from 6 to 7 years old on up." The record became a popular sensation and made her a star. After Webb died in 1939, the young singer was the band's nominal leader until mid-1942, when it broke up. Between her recording debut in 1935 and the demise of the band seven years later, Miss Fitzgerald recorded almost 150 sides, the majority of them novelties and disposable pop fluff.         During this period, she married Benjamin Kornegay, a shipyard worker and petty thief with a criminal record. The marriage ended in annulment after two years. The singer was 30 when she fell in love with the bassist Ray Brown while  they were on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band. They were married in December 1947, set up housekeeping in East Elmhurst, Queens, and adopted the son of Miss  Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named the boy Ray Jr. While Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on her career, her son was cared for by her aunt Virginia.         The marriage eventually became a casualty of conflicting career schedules, and the couple were divorced in 1953, although they continued to work together.  In 1957, there were reports in the Scandinavian press that she had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a Norwegian impresario. Miss Fitzgerald is survived by Ray Brown Jr. and a grandchild.         As early as 1942 and 43, Miss Fitzgerald began to be influenced by the experiments of such be-bop instrumentalists as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. She incorporated elements of be-bop rhythm and harmony into her singing, and while on tour with the Gillespie band in 1946 she embraced the music wholeheartedly.         A year earlier, she had recorded what would become one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade, a version of "Flying Home" in which she indulged extensively in the phonetic improvisation known as scat. Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.         Two years later, when Decca released her sensational be-bop version of "Lady  Be Good," Downbeat magazine proclaimed her "as great a master of bop as she has  been of swing."         These achievements were among the high points of a recording career that found Miss Fitzgerald recording in all manner of pop settings. Between 1935 and  1955 she recorded for Decca Records. Under the commercially astute supervision of the producer Milt Gabler, she was teamed with the vocal group the Ink Spots for several hits, including the million-selling "I'm Making Believe" and "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." She also scored commercially with novelty duets  recorded with Louis Jordan, the most popular of which was "Stone Cold Dead in the Market."         A Huge Change Of Direction         Dictated largely by the fads of the moment, Miss Fitzgerald's pre-1955 pop recording career was an artistically mixed bag and stood distinct from her work  as a swing and jazz singer in nightclubs. One of the artistic high points of the Decca years was a 10-inch long-playing record, "Ella Sings Gershwin," which she  recorded with the pianist Ellis Larkins in 1950.         Miss Fitzgerald's life changed when Norman Granz, the impresario of the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, invited her to join the touring jam sessions in 1949 and later became her manager. One of her most popular numbers,  "How High the Moon," evolved into the unofficial signature tune of the series.         Their relationship quickly developed into one of the most productive artist-manager partnerships in the history of jazz. When Miss Fitzgerald's contract with Decca expired, she became the first artist Mr. Granz signed to his new Verve label. It was under his supervision that she undertook the series of landmark "Songbook" albums that brought her voice to a large nonjazz audience.         "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop," she later recalled. "I thought be-bop was 'it,' and that all I had to do was go someplace  and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman came along, and he felt that I should do other things, so he produced 'The Cole Porter Songbook' with me. It was a turning point in my life."         "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook" became the prototype for a series of anthologies recorded over more than a decade and focusing on individual composers or composing teams, blending familiar standards and lesser-known, usually first-rate songs.         Backed by various studio orchestras, she also interpreted the work of Irving  Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer  and Rodgers and Hart. "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook," a 53-song, 5-LP collection recorded with the arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle in 1959, is widely regarded as the greatest of the collections.         These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing  the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.         From 1956 through the mid-1960's, Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on material that was almost consistently commensurate with her artistry, and her career soared. She made her first feature-film appearance in "Pete Kelly's Blues," in 1955, and in 1957 presented her own concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In April 1958 she gave a Carnegie Hall concert with Duke Ellington to celebrate the release of her four-disk set, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook."         A workhorse who toured from 40 to 45 weeks of each year, Miss Fitzgerald showed the first signs of fatigue when she nearly collapsed on the stage during a concert in Munich in 1965. Five years earlier, Mr. Granz had sold Verve records to MGM, and when her contract came up for renewal in 1966, she was not re-signed to the label, but Mr. Granz moved her to Capitol, where her producer,  Dave Dexter, promised to give her "a totally different sound." These albums, which included a religious record, an album of country music and a Christmas collection, found her groping insecurely for a new pop identity.         Signed briefly to Reprise Records, Miss Fitzgerald tried singing contemporary hits by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Marvin Gaye, but rock and soul proved almost as uncongenial to her style as had country.         Basie, Sinatra And Symphonies         She returned to jazz full time when Mr. Granz founded his label Pablo in 1973. Among her many Pablo recordings are four duet albums with the guitarist Joe Pass, made from 1973 to 1986, and another songbook album devoted to the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She also began performing regularly with symphony orchestras, and in 1974 she teamed with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie for a two-week concert engagement at the Uris Theater in New York that grossed more than a million dollars.         From the early 1970's, Miss Fitzgerald began to have eyesight problems complicated by diabetes, and in 1986 she had heart surgery, but she returned to  the concert stage the next year. Despite ill health, she continued to perform at least once month into the early 1990's. Although her quality of voice slowly deteriorated from the early 1970's, even at the end of her career, her singing retained a remarkable rhythmic acuity.         Offstage, Miss Fitzgerald lived a quiet, self-protective life in a 13-room house in Beverly Hills. Her social life involved a small circle of old friends,  including members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras, and other singers, including over the years Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.         A model of abstemious self-discipline, she shunned cigarettes and liquor. She was also a person of few words. Shy and extremely sensitive to criticism, she preferred to let Mr. Granz do most of the talking for her.         Asked once how she felt about being "a legend," she replied: "I don't think I noticed it at first. But when Norman Granz and I began recording the 'Songbook'  series in the mid-50's, it just seemed that more people began to like my singing. The awards I started winning didn't make me feel important, but they made me realize people loved me. And then kids started calling me 'Ella' -- half of them never even mentioned 'Ella Fitzgerald' -- just 'Ella.' "         She amassed countless awards and commendations, including honorary doctorates at Yale and Dartmouth, the National Medal of Arts, and 13 Grammy Awards, including one in 1967 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1979 she was given a Kennedy  Center Award for her lifetime in the performing arts.         Accepting an honorary doctorate of music at Yale, she commented with her characteristic modesty, "Not bad for someone who only studied music to get that  half-credit in high school."         Fitzgerald for Home Listening         Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most prolific recording artists in jazz. These are some of her best albums:         "Ella Fitzgerald: 75th-Birthday Celebration" (Decca Jazz). A two-disk, 39-song collection, it includes the cream of the singer's pop output recorded for Decca between 1938 and 1955.         "Pure Ella" (Decca Jazz). These 20 songs recorded in the 1950's with the pianist Ellis Larkins exemplify elegant simplicity and ideal teamwork.         "Ella and Louis" (Verve). In this 1956 collaboration with Louis Armstrong, two titans meet playfully.         "Like Someone in Love" (Verve). This lush collection of 19 ballads recorded in 1957 with Frank DeVol's orchestra is her most romantic album.         "Mack the Knife: The Complete Ella in Berlin" (Verve). This classic live album was recorded in 1960 when the singer was at the height of her powers.         "The Intimate Ella" (Verve). Originally released in 1960 under the title "Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From the Soundtrack of 'Let No Man Write My Epitaph,' " the collection of 13 ballads recorded with the pianist Paul Smith is a neglected masterpiece.         "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks" (Verve). Taken together, these 16 disks, recorded between 1956 and 1964, constitute the singer's crowning achievement. The tributes to Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer can also be purchased individually. Although the Cole Porter collection,  which was the first, is the most famous, it is not the best. The 53-song Gershwin album, recorded with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, is the artistic peak.         "Ella and Basie: On the Sunny Side of the Street" (Verve). A swinging powerhouse, released in 1963.         "Fitzgerald and Pass . . . Again" (Pablo). The best joint recording by two beautifully matched jazz classicists.         "Fine and Mellow" (Pablo). A wonderful swinging album from 1974, recorded with an all-star small ensemble.         Correction:  June 20, 1996, Thursday         An obituary on Sunday about Ella Fitzgerald misidentified the first feature film in which she appeared. It was "Ride 'Em Cowboy" in 1942, not "Pete Kelly's  Blues" in 1955.       
         Bea Dolen, the unflappable ringmaster who oversaw the often chaotic election  process in New York City for 14 years beginning in 1974, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 83 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was a massive stroke, her family said.         As executive director of the Board of Elections, she was in charge of its day-to-day operations, from voter registration through certification of the winners. She dispensed advice to the public on how to find the right voting booth in the right district.         Once nominations were complete, Mrs. Dolen was responsible for getting the right names in the right place on the right ballots. She commanded the forces that moved the machinery into the booths. She also took care of absentee ballots, not to mention petitions and appeals. It was a year-round proposition,  encompassing everything from local school board elections to special elections and capped by the November stampede for borough, city, state and national office every two years.         Mrs. Dolan worked to loosen regulations that kept some New Yorkers from casting votes. During her tenure, registration by mail became possible, as did phone registration under the "Voter 88" program. She also saw the fruits of a computerization program begun by the board in 1986. Two years earlier, when a backlog of 90,000 registrations threatened a particularly hectic Election Day, she calmed the doomsayers. She assured them: "I don't have a problem. Put that in bold type. We have a challenge. We are meeting it."         Betty Bernstein, known as Bea, was born in Brooklyn. She studied at a commercial college and became a legal secretary. She took part in local politics as a member of the Jefferson Democratic Club, a component of the Tammany Hall machine that orchestrated Democratic politics for generations. Its boss, Carmine DeSapio, procured a job for her as secretary to the president of the Board of Elections in 1964, and she did the rest.         Mrs. Dolen is survived by three sisters, Sophie Lipschitz of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Minnie Finke of Manhattan, and Ida Rutsky of Hempstead, L.I. Her husband,  Irving Dolen, died 12 years ago.       
         Harriett Heywood Patton, a founder of Recording for the Blind and a managing  director of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, died on Wednesday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville. She was 85 and lived in Bronxville.         She suffered a brief illness, her husband, Arch Patton, said.         Mrs. Patton is credited with contributing significantly to the growth of Recording for the Blind, which she served as president in 1954, and of the Opera Guild. She was managing director of the guild from 1959 to 1968.         She was born in Indianapolis and graduated from Wheelock College in Boston. During and after World War II, she worked for United China Relief and the Friends of France and played a pivotal role on the Committee for Economic Development, a national organization.         The committee brought together top corporate executives to plan for the postwar era; Mrs. Patton was recruited as deputy director.         Acting as a welcoming party of one, she kept track of the members' comings and goings and saw to it that they were fed, chauffeured and otherwise cared for.         In 1948, she was a founder of Recording for the Blind, and she helped build it from a local group in New York for the benefit of blind war veterans into a national organization. She crusaded across the country to get concerned people to band together in local chapters and open recording studios for volunteers to  do the readings.         Eleanor R. Belmont, founder of the Opera Guild and a friend, persuaded Mrs. Patton to turn her attention in that direction and become managing director. During her tenure of nearly 10 years, the guild's membership and donations quickly increased, both in the United States and abroad.         Mrs. Patton, who had served as a director, was familiar with the operation and earned a reputation for running a trim ship. Annual gifts to the guild, $90,000 in Mrs. Patton's first year as chief executive, rose nearly fourfold, to $355,000.         She grew up in Portland, Me., and acted in summer stock for three years as a  young woman.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Patton left no immediate family. An earlier marriage to Roswell L. Gilpatric ended in divorce.       
         Gertrude Crain, who was chairwoman of the Crain Communications publishing company for more than 20 years, died July 20 at her son's summer home on Cape Cod. She was 85 years old and lived in Chicago.         In all, Mrs. Crain spent 40 years with the Chicago-based company that her husband, G. D. Crain Jr., founded in 1916. The company publishes 27 trade, business and consumer newspapers, including Advertising Age, Crain's New York Business, Automotive News and Electronic Media, and owns a radio station in the  Florida Keys.         Mrs. Crain became chairwoman in 1974, succeeding her husband, who died in 1973. Before then, she had been secretary and assistant treasurer. She retired in May and became chairman emeritus.         In 1993, Mrs. Crain was awarded the Henry Johnson Fisher Award for lifetime achievement from the Magazine Publishers of America. Previous recipients have included Henry Luce, S. I. Newhouse Jr., Malcolm Forbes, John Mack Carter and Helen Gurley Brown.         Upon receiving the award at the Waldorf Astoria, Mrs. Crain said it rightly belonged to her husband, who started Crain Communications "with little more than a few hundred dollars and a dream."         Mrs. Crain, who served on the boards of the International Advertising Association, the National Press Foundation and the Advertising Council of New York, was an early critic of violence in television shows. In speeches to several advertising and communications organizations, she advocated voluntary restraint.         In 1982, Mrs. Crain became a founding member of the Committee of 200, an organization consisting of the top 200 women business owners and chief executives in the country.         Mrs. Crain is survived by her two sons, Keith of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Rance of New York City; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Judge Genevieve Blatt, the first woman to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania and to serve on the state's appellate court, died on Thursday at a  retirement home in Hampden Township, Pa. She was 83 and a former resident of Harrisburg.         She spent more than 50 years in public service, starting as secretary and chief examiner of the Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission in 1938.         She became a force in Pennsylvania's Democratic Party as a member of the Democratic National Committee and the party's National Policy Committee. She attended every Democratic National Convention from 1932 to 1972 and served as vice chairwoman of the Pennsylvania delegation at the 1956 convention. She was the secretary of the State Democratic Committee from 1948 to 1971.         She was an assistant city solicitor in Pittsburgh in the 1940's. In 1954 she  was elected Secretary of Internal Affairs, a statewide office. She was re-elected in 1958 and 1962 but lost her bid for a fourth term in 1966.         She won a tight race in a party primary to run for the United States Senate in 1964 but then lost the election by 50,000 votes to the Republican incumbent,  Senator Hugh Scott.         In 1972, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her to fill an unexpired term on the  Commonwealth Court, the state's appeals court. She won election on her own the next year, was re-elected in 1983, became a senior judge a year later and retired from the bench in 1993.         For her charitable, cultural and social work for the Roman Catholic Church, she received three papal honors, including the Lady Grand Cross in the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem.         Genevieve Blatt was born in East Brady, Clarion County. Majoring in economics, she received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh before graduating from its law school.         She is survived by two sisters, Sister Mary Frederick of Greensburg, Pa., and Bernadette B. McCloskey of Los Angeles, and a brother, Joseph A. Blatt of Pittsburgh.       
         Barbara Srenco Brier, a former world bridge champion, died yesterday in Allegheny University Hospitals Center City in Philadelphia. She was 73 and a resident of Miami.         Her daughter, Bonnie Brier of Penn Valley, Pa., said she died of complications after heart surgery.         In 1970 Mrs. Brier won the World Mixed Pairs Championship in Stockholm. Her partner was Waldemar Von Zedtwitz. This was a remarkable accomplishment, as he was 74 years old and had vision problems that made it difficult for him to see the cards. He died in 1984.         She won two national titles, the Open Pairs in 1955 and Mixed Teams in 1965, and was runner-up three times. She won many regional titles.         She was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Cornell University. She worked for many years as a bridge teacher, primarily in Miami.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Jean Hershell of Tinton Falls, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Catherine S. East, a little-known Government researcher who became the quiet inspiration for the National Organization for Women and a persistent goad to the nascent feminist movement, died on Saturday at Kendal at Ithaca, a retirement community in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 80.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Elizabeth R. East, her daughter.         Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book ''The Feminine Mystique'' is credited with helping to spark the modern women's movement, said yesterday that Ms. East was a ''prime mover'' in the 1966 birth of NOW.         ''She and others kept saying how what we needed is an N.A.A.C.P. for women,'' Ms. Friedan said. ''I thought of myself as a writer, not an organizer, but Catherine kept emphasizing that what was needed was outside pressure on the Government.''         Characteristically, Ms. East worked without public acknowledgment and was often so far in the background that friends in the movement started calling her ''Deep Throat.''         As a longtime researcher for the Labor Department and later as executive director for various Federal commissions and task forces on the status of women, she came to know scores of accomplished, professional women, in and out of Government, who were concerned about sex discrimination and became important in the feminist movement.         Moreover, she had an access to and command of facts on employment practices, workplace discrimination and other matters that she often used to disarm critics who opposed feminist legislation. But as a Government employee, she felt she could never take a public, vocal role, friends and colleagues said.         Vera Glaser, a journalist, recalled that at a news conference early in the Nixon Administration, she pointedly asked the new President whether he would appoint more women to his Administration. Ms. Glaser was surprised to get a letter later in which Ms. East wrote, ''I gather from the tone of your question, you might be interested in a few statistics.'' It was the beginning of a fruitful relationship that helped Ms. Glaser write a widely noted five-part newspaper series on discrimination against women. ''A lot of the facts came from Catherine,'' Ms. Glaser said.         In 1963, Ms. East helped write and research a Government report titled ''American Women,'' which called for the establishment of Federal and state commissions on women. It was at a conference of these commissions in June 1966 that a group of women came to Betty Friedan's hotel room to urge the formation of the group that, four months later, became NOW. Although Ms. East was not present in the hotel room, she had urged most of the women there to lobby Ms. Friedan.         ''Catherine would just persist and persist until it happened,'' recalled Mary Eastwood, a retired staff lawyer for the Justice Department and a friend of Ms. East.         The daughter of Ulysses Grant Shipe, a bank president in Huntington, W.Va., and Bertha Woody Shipe, a homemaker, Ms. East was educated at Marshall University in Huntington, where she received a bachelor's degree in history in 1943.         In addition to her daughter Elizabeth, of Ithaca, Ms. East is survived by another daughter, M. Victoria East of Seattle; a brother, Charles D. Shipe of Great Falls, Va., and a granddaughter.       
         Lillian Clark, a singer who performed with many stars of the big-band era and helped preserve the work of her husband, the composer and arranger Sy Oliver, died on Tuesday at her home in New York City. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, according to a statement from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, of which she was national treasurer.         Ms. Clark, whose original name was Autilia Ventimiglia, was born in Scranton, Pa. She studied at the Juilliard School, intending to become a classical pianist. But when one of the Clark Sisters left that popular singing group in the 1940's, she auditioned, got the job and changed her name.         She met her future husband when the group was performing on Tommy Dorsey's radio show on WOR. After Mr. Oliver died in 1988, she catalogued his music, most of which she donated to New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and to the Smithsonian Institution.         Ms. Clark appeared on Perry Como's television show in the 1950's and recorded with Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey and Louis Armstrong. She was also one of the original Ray Charles Singers and sang with other groups, including the Ray Conniff Singers and the Norman Luboff Choir.         She is survived by a son, Jeffry James Oliver of New York City, and a brother, Sal Ventimiglia.       
         Loret Miller Ruppe, who was head of the Peace Corps longer than anyone else in the organization's 35-year history and was credited by many with restoring much of its Kennedy-era vitality, died yesterday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 60.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ruppe was appointed director of the Peace Corps by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. She served for eight years, after which she was appointed Ambassador to Norway by President George Bush. She held that post until 1993.         When Mrs. Ruppe took over the Peace Corps, it was very much in need of revitalization. Its volunteer force had shrunk from a high of more than 15,000 in 1966 to about 5,000, and its budget had been cut.         The agency had had seven directors in the previous decade, and it had lost much of its independence after President Richard M. Nixon folded it into an umbrella agency called Action in an effort to downgrade some programs inherited from his Democratic predecessors.         In 1982, Congress restored the corps' independence. Mrs. Ruppe tried new approaches to bolster the volunteer ranks. She decided that the youthful idealism of, say, a 22-year-old English major might be nicely balanced by the experience and special skills of, say, an agricultural scientist in his mid-50's who did spot-welding in his spare time.         She pressed the search for volunteers with specific skills -- tending forests, stocking fish ponds, setting up sanitation systems -- and encouraged special arrangements with colleges and universities. Some colleges offered financial concessions to students with heavy debts if they joined the Peace Corps; others offered programs combining work on master's degrees with service in the corps.         On Jan. 10, 1985, Mrs. Ruppe went on national television to say that the Peace Corps was looking for 600 volunteers to do famine-relief work in Africa. Within a few days, more than 7,000 people contacted the agency.         Under Mrs. Ruppe, the Peace Corps developed short-term programs, enabling teachers, doctors and farmers to do volunteer work overseas while on sabbaticals or even long vacations. When Mrs. Ruppe became director, 3 percent of the volunteer were over age 50; six years later, 11 percent were.         During her tenure, Mrs. Ruppe (pronounced ROO-pee) visited volunteers in more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Pacific where the Peace Corps was involved. The agency started new programs or restarted dormant ones in Sri Lanka, Haiti, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and Cape Verde.         Mrs. Ruppe drew praise from R. Sargent Shriver, the Democrat and Kennedy in-law who was the Peace Corps' first director.         ''She's the kind of Republican we tried to recruit into management when we first started out,'' Mr. Shriver said in 1982.         Mrs. Ruppe had impeccable Republican credentials. Her husband, Philip, was a Republican Congressman from Michigan from 1967 to 1979. Mrs. Ruppe was Mr. Bush's campaign manager in the 1980 Michigan Presidential primary and was a leader of the Reagan-Bush campaign in Michigan that fall.         Mrs. Ruppe was born in Milwaukee. Her great-grandfather, Frederick Miller, founded the Miller Brewing Company. Her father, Frederick C. Miller, who had been captain of Notre Dame's 1928 football team, was the company chairman. He and a son, Frederick Jr., were killed in a plane crash in 1954.         Mrs. Ruppe attended Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Marquette University in Milwaukee.         Surviving are her husband, whom she married in 1957; five daughters, Antoinette Greenberg, of Chicago; Adele, of Mexico City; Loret Jr., a former Peace Corps volunteer, of Davis, Calif.; Katherine, of Manhattan, and Mary, of Bethesda; five sisters, Clair Krause and Gail Wray, both of Mequon, Wis.; Kate, of Springfield, Ill.; Carlotta Johnson, of Britain, and Adele, of Brunswick, Me.; a brother, Carl Miller, of Miami, and three grandchildren.       
         Rosina Cotton Quarles, who was the Federal Government's liaison with women's aviation groups in the 1960's, died on Aug. 3 at a hospital in Pensacola, Fla. She was 94 and lived at the Azalea Trace retirement community in Pensacola.         Mrs. Quarles, known as Nona, was born in New Orleans and worked as a newswoman in New York before she married Donald A. Quarles in 1939. Mr. Quarles, who served President Dwight D. Eisenhower as Secretary of the Air Force and Deputy Secretary of Defense, died in 1959.         Nona Quarles later joined the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington as public information officer for National Airport and Dulles International Airport. A licensed pilot and second lieutenant in the Civil Air Patrol, she was later promoted to special assistant for women's aviation activities in the Office of General Aviation Affairs.         In that capacity, she worked with women's organizations, private aviation groups and public agencies to coordinate the contributions women make to aviation. She dealt, among others, with the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, and was its chairwoman for a time.         Mrs. Quarles is survived by a daughter from a previous marriage, Mary Helen Dressner of the Woodlands, Tex.; a stepson, Donald A. Quarles Jr. of Eastham, Mass.; a stepdaughter, Elisabeth Ryden of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a sister, Virginia Weaver of Davenport, Fla.; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Bibi Besch, an actress who appeared on many of television's most popular shows and was on the board of the Screen Actors Guild, died last Saturday at the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles. Ms. Besch, who lived in Los Angeles, was 54.         She died of cancer, said her sister-in-law, Jenny Besch of Manhattan.         Ms. Besch, a daughter of the actress Gusti Huber and the mother of the actress Samantha Mathis, appeared on such television series as ''Northern Exposure,'' ''E.R.,'' ''L.A. Law,'' ''Law and Order,'' ''Night Court,'' Family Ties,'' ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' ''Coach,'' ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her performances in ''Doing Time on Maple Drive'' and on ''Northern Exposure'' won her Emmy nominations in 1992 and 1993.         Ms. Besch's film credits included ''Steel Magnolias,'' ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ''Tremors,'' ''Betsy's Wedding,'' ''Who's That Girl'' and ''The Promise.'' A director of the Screen Actors Guild from 1990 until her death, Ms. Besch served on many of the organization's committees, among them the national communications committee, the women's committee, the agents relations committee and the women's health task force.         Ms. Besch was born in Vienna, came to the United States as a child and grew up in the Westchester County towns of Mount Kisco and Chappaqua.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Besch is survived by her brother, Andrew Besch of Manhattan; two sisters, Drea Gillogly of Los Angeles and Christina MacDonald of Monceaux, France, and her stepfather, Joseph Besch of Manhattan.       
         Julia Morton, a self-taught expert on the uses of medicinal and toxic plants and a ''Dear Abby'' for Floridians concerned about poisonous greenery, died on Tuesday at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. She was 84 and lived in Homestead, Fla.         Mrs. Morton had been critically injured in an automobile accident on Aug. 28, said officials at the University of Miami, where she was a professor for about four decades until retiring in 1993.         To her colleagues in the field of economic botany, the study of how people use plants, Mrs. Morton was an academic's academic, a founder and developer of the Morton Collectanea, an invaluable compilation of information about plants, and the author of 10 books on the subject.         But to the people of South Florida -- backyard gardeners, telephone line workers and ranchers, for example -- she offered practical advice, practically every day, on plants that can harm humans or animals. Through letters and phone calls, lectures and even posters that she designed for hospital emergency rooms, she worked to educate the public.         ''She was the poison plant center'' in South Florida, said Lawrence Kaplan, an emeritus professor of botany at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and editor of the journal of the Society of Economic Botany, which Mrs. Morton helped found. Anyone who suspected contact with plants that might be dangerous could, and did, contact her.         Her plant expertise extended far beyond the toxic variety. Several of her books are considered standard references in the field, including ''The Atlas of Medicinal Plants of Middle America'' (C.C. Thomas, 1981). She also had extensive knowledge of tropical fruits, which she also shared with anyone who asked.         ''She used to get mail by the pound from people all over the world,'' said Dr. Robert Kelley, associate chairman of the department of mathematics and computer science at the University of Miami, who knew Mrs. Morton for more than 20 years.         The letters would inquire about a particular plant, and Mrs. Morton would respond after doing the necessary research in her vast collection of reports, books and newspaper clippings or, often, just pulling the information out of her memory.         Mrs. Morton, who was reared in Vermont, never got a college degree. She started the Morton Collectanea with her husband, Kendal, in 1933 from an office near the New York Public Library.         The couple lived in the Bahamas during World War II, and their studies of the plant life there resulted in their first book, ''50 Tropical Fruits of Nassau'' (1949). The work attracted the attention of the president of the University of Miami, Bowman Foster Ashe, who offered them jobs as professors. Mr. Morton, a trained scientist, died in 1964.         Dr. John Beutler, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., said that unlike many botanists who only dabble in the study of how plants are used, Mrs. Morton devoted all of her time to the field.         Dr. Beutler said he first encountered Mrs. Morton about two decades ago, when she sent him a plant that she thought might have some applications to cancer treatment. ''She was always on the lookout for obscure plants that might serve a useful purpose,'' he said.         Mrs. Morton is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Agnes Mongan, the first woman to be a curator and then the first to be a director at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., died on Sunday at a hospital in Cambridge. She was 91 and lived in Cambridge.         Miss Mongan was one of the leading museum professionals of a generation that helped set the course of American museums in this century. With a dual interest in Old Master drawings and contemporary art, she was especially known for her connoisseurship, her meticulous research and her teaching abilities.         She was born in Somerville, Mass., in 1905 and graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1927, having studied art history and English. In 1929, after graduate work at Smith College and a year of studying works of art firsthand in Europe, she accepted a position at the Fogg.         Her first job was as a research assistant under Paul Sachs, associate director of the Fogg. In this role she absorbed his tenets while also forming close friendships with many of the Fogg's alumni, who included such museum directors and curators as Alred H. Barr Jr., James Rorimer, A. Everett Austin and Henry-Russell Hitchcock.         With Sachs, Miss Mongan spent the 1930's cataloguing the Fogg's remarkable drawings collection. The results of their labors, ''Drawings in the Fogg Museum of Art,'' published in 1940, was the first comprehensive catalogue of a drawing collection in this country. A second cataloguing project, that of the enormous collection Grenville Winthrop bequeathed to the Fogg in 1943, expanded Miss Mongan's expertise into the 19th-century French drawings, especially the work of Ingres.         Harvard finally lifted its policy banning female curators, and in 1947, after serving for several years as ''keeper of drawings,'' Miss Mongan was named curator. She became assistant director in 1951, associate director in 1964, acting director in 1968 and director in 1969. She retired in 1971.         Miss Mongan is survived by her sister, Elizabeth, a former curator of prints at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, of Pigeon Cove, Mass.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.

         Ludmilla Chiriaeff, the founder of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal and a major force in Canadian dance, died on Sunday at a hospital in Montreal. She was 72.         She died of complications from a lung illness, said Catherine Luft Mead, a daughter.         Mme. Chiriaeff developed a major company in a city that knew little about ballet before her arrival there in 1952. Her earliest efforts perplexed straitlaced audiences, and a clergyman once chastised her for showing her legs in public. Mme. Chiriaeff persevered, and, in addition to building a company, she became a pioneer of dance on Canadian television and a leader of Canadian dance education.         Born in Riga, Latvia, of a Russian father and a Polish mother, Mme. Chiriaeff grew up in Berlin, where she received her first ballet lessons. She appeared with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, 1936-37, but was considered too young to remain on the company's arduous tours. She danced with the Berlin State Opera Ballet during World War II until Nazi doctors measuring her body decided that she must be Jewish (she was not) and sent her to a labor camp.         After the war she danced with companies in Switzerland, then moved to Montreal with the aid of the International Rescue Committee. Les Ballets Chiriaeff, which she founded in 1952, originally functioned as an ensemble for television, dancing on so many shows that its dancers were nicknamed ''Chiriaeff's grasshoppers,'' perpetually hopping about on the screen.         The group made its stage debut in 1955 and aroused such enthusiasm that Mme. Chiriaeff decided to transform it into a company for Canadian theaters. Renamed Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958, it acquired an eclectic repertory and toured widely. In 1969, when he troupe danced Fernand Nault's ''Symphony of Psalms'' in a Montreal church, many local theatergoers decided that the city no longer found ballet to be morally suspect.         The following year, Mr. Nault, a French-Canadian choreographer, made Les Grands Ballets Canadiens internationally famous with his staging of ''Tommy,'' the rock-opera by the Who.         Mme. Chiriaeff founded l'Academie des Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958 and l'Ecole Superieure de Danse in 1966, and relinquished the artistic direction of her company in 1974 to devote herself full-time to educational activities. Her many projects ranged from courses for students desiring professional careers to introductory ballet lessons for sixth graders.         Among the honors received by Mme. Chiriaeff are the Governor General's Medal of the Order of Canada, the Governor General's Award for the Performing Arts, the Denise Pelletier Award for the Performing Arts and honorary doctorates from McGill University, the University of Montreal and the University of Quebec. She was named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1984 and an Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1985. The City of Montreal proclaimed her a ''Grande Montrealaise (Great Montrealer)'' in 1978, and the headquarters of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens is called La Maison de la Danse Ludmilla Chiriaeff in her honor.         Mme. Chiriaeff was married twice; both marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Mead, of New York City, she is survived by two other daughters, Anastasia Chiriaeff of Montreal, and Ludmilla Luft Ivanovic of Boston; two sons, Avde Chiriaeff and Gleb Chiriaeff, both of Montreal, and four granddaughters.       
         Kathleen Carlin, a social service executive who devoted her professional life to the proposition that men can learn to get along quite well without beating up their wives and girlfriends, died on Sept. 20 at a hospice near her home in Atlanta. She was 57 and had been a leading voice in the movement to stop violence against women.         Colleagues said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Carlin, a native of Maywood, Neb., who graduated from the University of Nebraska and received a master's in social work there, married right after college and began raising a family, first in Atlanta and later in Houston. She did not begin her career until the mid-1970's, when she and her family returned to Atlanta and settled there for good.         But once she got started, taking a job in suburban Atlanta as director of Georgia's first shelter for battered women, Ms. Carlin became so outraged by what she viewed as society's indifference to the problem that she was soon in the forefront of national efforts to curb domestic violence.         Although Ms. Carlin held high positions in the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, helped found the National Women's Abuse Prevention Project and was keynote speaker at national conferences, her major contribution came as the executive director of Men Stopping Violence, an organization based in Atlanta that she helped establish in 1982.         With a $5 million annual budget, the group seeks to effect change  across the spectrum of what Ms. Carlin described as a continuum of sanctioned abuse of women. In addition to running programs of intensive behavior modification for men with a history of abusing women and training instructors to operate similar programs across the country, the organization works to change the social norms of male supremacy and control that Ms. Carlin came to see as the underlying causes of abuse.         Although the organization has shown some promise -- for example, winning contracts with the military and religious denominations to help them change their organizational cultures to take the issue seriously -- Ms. Carlin did not need to be reminded that her efforts were barely a beginning.         After all, as she was quick to point out, an estimated 3 million to 4 million women suffer some degree of physical abuse at the hands of men each year, and surveys indicate that women in two-thirds of American marriages are battered at least once by their husbands.         And Ms. Carlin, who saw physical violence as just one extreme measure men use to control women, had an answer for anyone who might suggest that in the vast majority of those marriages the violence was so rare as to be inconsequential. She would be ready with a case history to show that a single beating was often all it took for a man to establish domination.         The case involved a woman whose husband beat her severely one Thanksgiving and never laid a hand on her after that -- because he did not have to. As Ms. Carlin recalled, after that all he had to do when his wife balked at bowing to his wishes was to say ''remember Thanksgiving,'' and the terrified wife would submit.         Just as that wife had learned to conduct herself to avoid the serious consequences of displeasing her husband, Ms. Carlin felt that men would decide not to beat their wives at the exact moment that society came to regard domestic abuse as a serious criminal offense to be dealt with swiftly, surely and severely.         And that, she argued, will never happen until society abandons the notion of across-the-board male domination that tends to justify violence against women in the first place. That may be a tall order, but Ms. Carlin was not one to shrink from a challenge. In 1990, for example, she joined a group of women who scaled Mount Kenya, and for all her frustrations in trying to reform an entire society, she knew how to have a good time.         Indeed, her annual high-spirited Christmas parties made such an impression on her staff and friends that they provided an antidote of sorts to the grim ''remember Thanksgiving'' tag line of Ms. Carlin's anecdote of domestic abuse. Or, as those who vowed to continue her work might put it, ''remember Christmas.''         Ms. Carlin is survived by her husband, John; two daughters, Suzanne Rianhard of San Francisco and Elizabeth Carlin of New York; her mother, Arlene Hough of Atlanta, and a sister, Janet Allen of Dallas.       
         Mary Ellen Jones, a biochemist whose studies of the components of DNA were part of the foundation of basic cancer research, died on Aug. 23 in Waltham, Mass. She was 73 and had lived in the Boston area for the past year.         Dr. Jones, who was the first woman to head a department in the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, died of cancer, her family said. She had been treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.         DNA molecules are the building blocks of life, and Dr. Jones's research helped uncover how cells make the building blocks of DNA. She studied enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotides, the links in the helical chain that is deoxyribonucleic acid.         ''It was a positive line of investigation with the hope that some kind of cancer therapy would result,'' said Dr. Thomas Traut, a colleague at the university. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells are constantly dividing and thus need to make new DNA all the time. So cutting the supply of DNA components, the thinking went, could be one way to stop the cancer.         Although the enzymes Dr. Jones studied eventually turned out not to hold promise for cancer therapy, several of them ''are still seen as limited targets for a few diseases,'' said Dr. Traut, an associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics. Beyond that, he said, Dr. Jones contributed immensely to a field in its formative stages.         ''Forty years ago, people knew very little about this stuff,'' Dr. Traut said. Although the field expanded greatly in the 1970's, he said, Dr. Jones ''was at the front with a handful of other labs'' in the 1950's, when she did her first major research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.  That work involved the discovery of carbamyl phosphate, one compound in the sequence by which nucleotides are made.         Dr. Jones was born in LaGrange Park, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the University of Chicago in 1944. She did graduate work at Yale University, receiving a doctorate in 1951.         After leaving Massachusetts General in 1957, she was a professor at Brandeis University until 1966. She became an associate professor at North Carolina that year, left in 1971 for a seven-year stint at the University of Southern California and then returned to North Carolina as chairwoman of the department of biochemistry and nutrition at the medical school.         She resigned as chairwoman in 1989, but she remained active in research and teaching until her retirement last year. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1984.         Her marriage, to Paul L. Munson, ended in divorce. She is survived by a sister, Anna Mae Dufty, of Pueblo, Colo.; two brothers, George K. Jones, of West Roxbury, Mass., and Elmer E. Jones, of Weston, Mass.; a daughter, Catherine L. Munson, of Fort Mill, S.C.; a son, Ethan V. Munson, of Milwaukee, and one grandchild.       
         Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.         Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.         ''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''         It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.         Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.         A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.         Ms. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.         Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.         Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.         There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''         A former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''         Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.         Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.         Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.         ''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.         The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.         Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.         For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.         Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.         ''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.         She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.         One day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''         ''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''         Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.       
         Beryl Reid, the versatile British character actress who won a Tony Award in 1967 for her performance in ''The Killing of Sister George'' and was one of the most popular stars on the London stage and on British television, died on Sunday. She was 76.         She had developed pneumonia after undergoing a knee operation, her agent, Robert Luff, said. He would not say where she died.         Ms. Reid, who specialized in eccentric characters, had been a stand-up comic and variety entertainer for 30 years before making the transition to more serious acting. She performed in plays by Joe Orton, Edward Albee and Peter Nichols, as well as in classics for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater.         She had her greatest success as June Buckridge in Frank Marcus's ''Killing of Sister George.'' June was a lusty, cigar-smoking soap opera actress whose role as a rural nurse named Sister George was being excised from a long-running radio serial. In the play, which was a hit both in London and New York, Ms. Reid and Eileen Atkins portrayed a lesbian couple in a disintegrating relationship.         Friends had warned Ms. Reid not to touch the play ''with a barge pole,'' thinking that the role would damage her image. Instead, it made her international reputation. She later starred in the Robert Aldrich film version, with Susannah York replacing Ms. Atkins. Sister George became her signature role, but it was one of several peaks in her career.         She played the seductive landlady in the film of Joe Orton's ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' and recreated that role in a 1975 revival of the play at the Royal Court Theater. Subsequently, she won more admirers in the United States and London through television, especially from her role opposite Alec Guinness in the dramatizations of John le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ''Smiley's People.'' Ms. Reid was Connie Sachs, George Smiley's former research aide, who, despite her drinking, retained her exceptional memory.         Ms. Reid was born in Hereford, England. Leaving school at 16, she made her debut in 1936 as a music hall performer at the Floral Hall, Bridlington. Before and during World War II, she took part in variety shows and pantomimes. Her comic imagination was certified on the BBC radio series ''Educating Archie,'' in which she created and played two contrasting roles, a schoolgirl in love with a ventriloquist's dummy and an earthy teen-ager with airs.         In 1951, she made her London stage debut in ''After the Show,'' followed by a series of musical revues, in which she demonstrated the transforming ability of a chameleon. She said she usually played 16 to 18 characters in one night and never looked the same. After Ms. Reid appeared in a revue sketch by Harold Pinter in 1959, Harold Clurman called her ''a real artist and trouper with technical command.''         ''Sister George,'' first presented in Bristol and in London in 1965, was her breakthrough. Later she acted in Mr. Albee's ''Counting the Ways'' at the National, in Congreve's ''Way of the World'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and in Mr. Nichols's ''Born in the Gardens.''         Her films include ''The Belles of St. Trinian's,'' ''The Dock Brief'' (renamed ''Trial and Error'' in the United States), ''Inspector Clouseau'' and Dylan Thomas's ''Doctor and the Devils.''         In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby described her role in ''Joseph Andrews'' in 1977 as ''a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver trying to be dainty.''         Ms. Reid wrote an autobiography, ''So Much Love,'' and was the co-author of ''Cats' Whiskers'' and ''Beryl, Food and Friends.'' In 1986 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.         Married and divorced twice, she lived in a cottage in Wraysbury, outside London. No immediate family members survive.       
         Eleanor Frances Cameron, an award-winning writer of children's books, died on Friday at Hospice House in Monterey, Calif. She was 84 and lived in Pebble Beach, Calif.         Mrs. Cameron was the author of 17 children's books. She began her writing career in 1950 with ''The Unheard Music,'' her one book for adults, and published her first children's book, ''The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet,'' in 1954. That book, an adventure about space travel, inspired four ''Mushroom Planet'' sequels.         ''The Court of the Stone Children'' (1973), a complex tale involving ghostly apparitions in modern-day San Francisco, won her a National Book Award. She was a semifinalist for the award in 1979, for ''To the Green Mountains.'' Her other books include ''The Green and Burning Tree,'' ''The Beast With the Magical Horn,'' ''The Mysterious Christmas Shell'' and ''A Room Made of Windows,'' about a girl's journey to becoming a writer.         Mrs. Cameron was born in 1912, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her family moved to Ohio when she was 3, and then to California.         She is survived by a son, David, of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Edith Tilton Penrose, an American-born British economist who was an authority on corporate growth and on oil, died on Oct. 11 in Waterbeach -- near Cambridge, England -- where she lived. She was 81.         Her death was reported on Saturday by The Guardian and The Independent.         Dr. Penrose, whose doctorate was from Johns Hopkins University, retired in 1978 as a professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, where she concurrently headed the school's economics department. In later years she was a professor and a dean at the Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires in Fontainebleau, France.         Her best-known book is ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959, Oxford), about the ways companies grow and the reasons why they do. Jay B. Barney, a professor of management at Ohio State University, writing in a management journal last year, called it a seminal work about ''the competitive implications of a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses.''         A Scottish economist, Sir Alec Cairncross, recalled in The Independent on Saturday, that the book brought Dr. Penrose ''instant recognition as a creative thinker, and its importance to the analysis of the job of management has been increasingly realized.''         In theorizing about companies, Dr. Penrose held that, as The Guardian  put it: ''There are important administrative restraints on the speed of the firm's growth. Human resources required for the management of change are tied to the individual firm and so are internally scarce. Expansion requires the recruitment of more such resources. New recruits cannot become fully effective overnight. The growth process is, therefore, dynamically constrained.''         Dr. Penrose's interest in oil originated in the late 1950's, when she was a visiting professor at the University of Baghdad. In a 1976 interview, she recalled: ''I was doing a book on multinational corporations, although nobody called them that in those days. Being in Iraq, it would have been rather silly not to concentrate on oil, wouldn't it?''         That book, ''The Large International Firm in Developing Countries: The International Petroleum Industry,'' was published in 1968, and by 1976 she was considered one of the top oil economists in the world.         In the 1976 interview, she said: ''Historically, the international oil companies often have wielded their vast power selfishly, although their accomplishments have often been beneficial to the world.'' By that time, oil executives had often been less than pleased with conclusions expressed in her writings, but she contended: ''I don't take sides. I just gather the facts and if people don't like my work, they just don't like the facts.''         Edith Tilton was born in Los Angeles and received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from the University of California at Berkeley. After working for the American Embassy in London, she received her doctorate in 1950. Her first book, ''Economics of the International Patent System,'' was published in 1951.         Dr. Penrose was a lecturer and research associate at Johns Hopkins for many years. Sir Alec wrote that after a campaign she and her husband, Ernest F. Penrose, a British-born economist and writer, ''conducted in support of Owen Lattimore, a professor accused of un-American activities,'' the couple ''fell afoul of McCarthy and were more or less exiled, first to the Australian National University in Canberra and then to Baghdad University.'' Then the couple moved to Britain.         Dr. Penrose married David Burton Denhardt in 1934; he died in 1938. She married Mr. Penrose in 1944; he died in 1984. Her survivors include three sons.       
         Ruth Lewis Farkas, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1973 after she and her husband, the founder of the Alexander's department stores, contributed $300,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, died on Friday at the Park Avenue home of her son Robin. She was 89.         Mrs. Farkas, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla., had been staying with Mr. Farkas and his wife, Carol, a nurse, in Manhattan since her release two weeks ago from the New York University Medical Center, where she had been treated for a heart ailment.         Despite the uproar that surrounded Mrs. Farkas's appointment and a delay in her Senate confirmation, her posting caused little stir in the tiny grand duchy of Luxembourg, which was accustomed to Americans whose path to ambassadorships was paved with political contributions.         Although Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast his Foreign Relations committee vote against her and denounced her appointment as demeaning the Foreign Service, Senator Gale W. McGee of Wyoming said he was satisfied that Mrs. Farkas was innocent of any impropriety and laughed about the custom of making envoys of people who make generous campaign contributions.         ''The money -- that's par for the course,'' he said. ''It used to be a cheaper price -- but that's Nixon inflation.''         In contrast to Ambassador Perle Mesta, the Washington socialite who arrived in Luxembourg in 1949 with flamboyant ways and gala parties that inspired the Broadway musical ''Call Me Madam,'' Mrs. Farkas, who held a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University and a doctorate in education from New York University, maintained a low profile.         Reserved by nature and press-shy because of the uproar that surrounded her appointment, she was more at ease as the sponsor of forums on the drug problems of teen-agers than in being a second coming of a woman known as the hostess with the mostest.         Not until two years after Mrs. Farkas arrived did she make her first splash in the social life of Luxembourg, with a charity gala that featured the singer Sacha Distel and a United States Army orchestra. The event took in $28,000 for a school for handicapped children.         She maintained close ties with the Government, gave quiet and unpretentious parties and, unlike many envoys, avoided making political statements about United States policy. Most diplomatic work was carried out by her six-member staff, and in the Luxembourg diplomatic community, which then included 13 other ambassadors, Mrs. Farkas, though serious, was not considered a heavyweight.         President Gerald R. Ford accepted her resignation in 1976 and replaced her with Rosemary L. Ginn, a longtime Republican national committeewoman from Missouri.         Mrs. Farkas settled in Florida and resumed her many philanthropic and humanitarian activities and research into male and female roles through the Role Foundation, which she established in 1967.         Ruth Lewis, one of five children of Samuel Lewis and the former Jennie Bach, was born in Manhattan in 1906. Both her parents were in the real estate business and each influenced her. ''Community living and sharing, that was my mother; intellectual pursuits, that was my father,'' Mrs. Farkas once said.         Accompanying her mother into tenements taught her about poverty, and Mrs. Farkas never forgot her mother's advice: ''No matter what your station in life, no matter what you grow up to be, always try to  contribute to those less fortunate than you.''         She met George Farkas when she was 10. Their families lived in the same apartment house, at 107th Street and Fifth Avenue, where George, whose father had died, kept a close eye on his little sister, who was Ruth Lewis's best friend.         ''I didn't like him at first because he was such a boss,'' she said.         They were married in 1928, but not until she graduated from New York University. She received a master's degree from Columbia in 1932 and  was for many years a member of the executive committee of Alexander's.         Mr. Farkas died in 1980.         In addition to Robin, Mrs. Farkas is survived by three other sons, Alexander of Highland Park, Fla., and  Bruce and Jonathan, of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Constance Woodruff, who was active in labor and women's issues and was a Democratic Party stalwart, died on Saturday at St. Michael's Medical Center in Newark. She was 74 and lived in West Orange, N.J.         The cause was cancer, said Jan M. Johnson, executive editor of City News in Plainfield, N.J., for which Mrs. Woodruff wrote political commentary until her illness was diagnosed in the spring.         Mrs. Woodruff was a Democratic National Committeewoman for two terms. She was co-chairwoman of the New Jersey delegation at the 1976 National Democratic Convention.         Six governors, starting with Gov. Richard J. Hughes in the 60's, named her to state commissions. In 1975, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed her the first chairwoman of the State Advisory Commission on the Status of Women despite objections to her strong partisan identification as the secretary of the State Democratic Committee.         She was the chairwoman of the commission for 16 years, traveling the state to foster similar bodies at the county level. She was twice elected to lead the national umbrella Association of Commissions on Women, of which she eventually became president emeritus. The national group advises state organizations, like the New Jersey Division on Women, on issues deemed important to women.         She was born in Newark, and was city editor of the Herald-News of Newark, a black-oriented weekly.         Later, during two decades with the International Ladies Garment Workers, she directed community relations for the union's eastern region.         Along the way, she graduated from Empire State College and got a master's in labor studies from Rutgers University.         She was an adjunct professor of labor studies at Rutgers-Newark and spent her last 10 years in education as director of public relations and development for Essex County College.         Mrs. Woodruff is survived by a sister, Gwendolyn Williams of Petersburg, Va., and a brother, Leon Rochester of East Orange. Her husband of 42 years, Bill Woodruff, died in April.       
         Grace E. Bessay, who won a prolonged legal struggle to keep the Federal Government from ousting her from a two-room summer shanty on Cape Cod, died on Oct. 10 in Cambridge, Mass. where she had her main home for 50 years. She was 84.         Her death was reported yesterday by The Associated Press. The cause of death and where in Cambridge she died were not disclosed.         Ms. Bessay, a retired bookkeeper, reached agreement with the National Park Service in 1991 -- shortly before she was to be evicted -- to settle her lawsuit.         Under the settlement, she received a cash settlement and permission to keep on using the primitive cottage -- her longtime summer home, on an eight-acre site -- for 25 more years.         ''I'll be making use of it for all the 25 years,'' she said triumphantly.         Her shanty was one of 17 simple cottages on a small compound, in the dunes of Truro and Provincetown, within the 43,000-acre Cape Cod National Seashore. The cottages were once retreats for writers like E. E. Cummings, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer and Eugene O'Neill.         In 1967, the National Park Service claimed the structures as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The owners of 16 cottages later signed agreements with the Park Service that let them continue using them for 25 additional years.         But the 17th owner, Andrew Fuller, declined to sign and continued a lawsuit. He died in 1981, and Ms. Bessay, a longtime friend, inherited his shanty and the suit. Just before she settled it, she declared: ''I'm looking for security so they can't come and throw me out.''         Ms. Bessay was born in Akron, Ohio, received a degree from Akron University and also studied at Radcliffe College.       
         Hermine Baron, one of America's top-ranked female bridge players, died in Los Angeles on Sept. 27. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Arthur Baron of Los Angeles.         For the last 22 years, Mrs. Baron had more master points than any other female player, ending with 22,645 and the title of grand life master. From 1975 to 1983, she was ranked second among all players by the American Contract Bridge League, and was 10th when she died.         In 1964 and 1970, she won the McKenney Trophy, awarded for winning the most points in a calendar year.In 1964, she set a points record.         Mrs. Baron was a member of the United States Women's Team that took third place in the 1968 world championships in Deauville, France, and she competed in the World Women's Pairs Championship in 1978 and 1982. In national competition, she won the Life Master Pairs in 1966 and five other titles: the Women's Teams in 1964 and 1968; the Women's Pairs in 1968 and 1982, and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1963. She finished second seven times.         Mrs. Baron was born in Omaha and stricken with polio at the age of 13, after which she was confined to a wheelchair.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Jerry Hirschman of Chicago.       
         Diane Dickerson Montgomery, a former psychiatric social worker and bank officer who was involved in civil rights causes since childhood, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 62 and also had homes in Lubec, Me., and Key West, Fla.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Charles H. Montgomery.         A graduate of the Francis Parker School in Chicago and Mills College in Oakland, Calif., she earned a master's degree in social work at the University of Chicago and went to work for several public and private agencies. She later joined the First National Bank of Chicago as an officer in the trust department.         Her early advocacy of racial equality was inspired by her father, Earl B. Dickerson, a prominent Chicago civil-rights lawyer and 30-year board member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Dickerson, who won major legal battles involving housing segregation in Chicago, took her along as a child when he visited whites-only restaurants, was refused service and sued their owners.         Later, barred from the dining room of a major Chicago hotel, she asked her father's advice. ''Sue,'' he said. She did, and won.         Mr. Dickerson died in 1986.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Stephen Brown of Oak Park, Ill., and Joshua Cohen of Chicago; a daughter, Judith Cohen Brown of Seattle; a stepdaughter, Alison Montgomery of Chicago; a stepson, Douglas Montgomery of Libertyville, Ill., and two grandchildren.       
         Irma Ullmann, the matriarch of a New York philanthropic family, died on Nov. 4 at White Plains Hospital while staying with family in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 91 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla., since moving from Manhattan more than 30 years ago.         Working through the Ullmann Family Foundation, she carried on the work she began with her husband, Siegfried Ullmann, a Wall Street commodities trader, supporting educational and medical institutions here and in Israel. Centers and projects they sponsored in both countries bear their name.         Among the chief beneficiaries were Yeshiva University and its Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where she was a board member of the national women's division. The Ullmanns established the college's Research Center for Health Sciences and a chair in molecular genetics.         At the American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, she was a principal supporter of scientific and technological research at the institute in Haifa. The Ullman Teaching Center serves undergraduates and Technion's 19 faculty departments, and family funds sustained an Ullmann Robotics Center, along with scholarships, dormitories and laboratories.         The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel was a beneficiary from its beginning, and she left her stamp on its Ullmann Institute of Life Sciences, the Ullmann Gallery at Weizmann, to which she contributed art from her private collection, and an Ullmann Professorial Chair.         Other major recipients included UJA-Federation of New York and the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. The Lichtenstadter Hospital for the Chronically Ill in Israel was established in memory of her parents, Jakob and Flora Lichtenstadter.         Mrs. Ullmann is survived by a son, Dr. Leonard P. Ullmann of Incline Village, Nev., five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Her husband of 40 years, Siegfried, a founder and former president of the international metals and commodities trading firm of Philipp Brothers, died in 1966.       
         Hildegarde Fillmore Smith, a former fashion and beauty editor at the women's magazine McCall's, died on Monday in her garret apartment at the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park South.         She was 98 and had lived at the club for the last 43 years.         A native of Cincinnati and a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, she came to New York City as an aspiring poet and settled into a career in publishing instead.         In addition to editing, she worked as a Hollywood correspondent. She also served on the Board of Governors of the Fashion Group and on the committee for the American Fashion Critics Award.         After retiring in 1953 she became active in the National Arts Club, editing its bulletin and serving as its  secretary for more than a decade.         She is survived by a sister, Chalma Mathewson of Cincinnati.       
         Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a psychologist who defied conventional wisdom and greatly emboldened the fledgling gay rights movement in the 1950's by finding there was no measurable psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men, died on Monday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Hooker, who spent 30 years teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles, began studying homosexual men in the late 1940's, a period in which they were considered maladjusted -- at best -- and generally ignored or anathematized by the medical and mental health professions.         ''She never treated us like some strange tribe,'' recalled the writer Christopher Isherwood, who knew her at the time, ''so we told her things we never told anyone before.''         Her most significant work was a paper delivered in 1956 to the American Psychological Association in Chicago and published the next year as ''The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual'' in The Journal of Projective Techniques.         Dr. Hooker administered three standard personality tests, including the Rorschach ink-blot test, to two groups of 30 men, one heterosexual, one homosexual, who had been matched in I.Q.'s, age and education levels.         She then asked a panel of expert clinicians to assess the results without knowing the subjects' sexual orientation. To their surprise, the judges were unable to discern between the two groups on the basis of the test.         ''The most striking finding of the three judges,'' Dr. Hooker wrote, ''was that many of the homosexuals were very well adjusted. In fact, the three judges agreed on two-thirds of the group as being average to superior in adjustment. Not only do all homosexuals not have strong feminine identification, nor are they all 'somewhat paranoid,' but, according to the judges, some may not be characterized by any demonstrable pathology.''         Her study was criticized in many quarters, not least because it upended psychological orthodoxy. Among other objections was that she recruited her gay subjects through the assistance of ''homophile'' groups like the Mattachine Society, meaning that the men might be more content with their lives than the average homosexual and eager to prove that they were well adjusted.         Moreover, the study was published in a journal that did not reach a wide public audience. Nonetheless, it was considered a precursor to the decision 17 years later by the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.         ''Her work in the 1950's really provided the framework within which the American Psychiatric Association could rethink its viewpoint,'' said Dr. Richard A. Isay, clinical professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College.         And 36 years after Dr. Hooker addressed the American Psychological Association, the organization gave her its award for distinguished contribution to psychology in the public interest, saying, ''This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior.''         Evelyn Gentry was born in North Platte, Neb., in 1907 and grew up in northeastern Colorado. She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Colorado and her Ph.D., in 1932, from Johns Hopkins University.         Her exposure to the rise of Nazism while in Berlin on a fellowship in the late 1930's intensified her desire to make ''her life count in helping to correct social injustice,'' said a 1992 article in American Psychologist.         She joined the faculty at U.C.L.A. in 1939 and, outside of one year at Bryn Mawr, remained there until 1970. It was at U.C.L.A. in the 1940's that she befriended a gay student, Sam From, who introduced her in turn to his circle of friends. It was Mr. From who said, ''We have let you see us as we are, and now, it is your scientific duty to make a study of people like us.''         At the peak of the McCarthy period, in 1953, she applied for and received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. ''They talk about all this courage I'm supposed to have had,'' she recalled four decades later, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I don't get that. Curiosity and empathy were what compelled me to do my study.''         In 1967, Dr. Hooker was appointed to head a study group on homosexuality for the National Institute of Mental Health. That panel recommended a repeal of sodomy laws and better public education about homosexuality.         After retiring from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hooker had a private practice until the late 1970's. She reviewed articles for professional journals and helped establish the Placek Fund of the American Psychological Foundation, which provides money for research into homosexuality.         She was also the subject of a 1992 documentary, ''Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker,'' by David Haugland and Richard Schmiechen.         Her second husband, Edward Niles Hooker, died in 1957. She is survived by two sisters, Mildred Haugh, of Downey, Calif., and Myrtle Fisher, of Colorado.         In recent years, Dr. Hooker was frequently approached by strangers wanting to express their gratitude, such as a young woman who told her that she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital when her parents learned she was a lesbian.         ''The standard procedure for treating homosexuals in that hospital was electroshock therapy,'' Dr. Hooker recalled in the book ''Making History'' (HarperCollins, 1992) by Eric Marcus.         ''Her psychiatrist was familiar with my work and he was able to keep them from giving it to her. She had tears streaming down her face as she told me this. I know that wherever I go, there are men and women for whom my little bit of work and my caring enough to do it has made an enormous difference in their lives.''       
         Mary Louise Stack Duschl, a former artistic administrator for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, died on Wednesday at her home in Pittsburgh. She was 45.         The cause was cancer, said Patricia Wilde, artistic director of the ballet company.         Ms. Duschl began her professional career as a member of the dance faculty at Michigan State University, from 1974 to 1977.         She was the artistic director of Danceworks, the modern dance troupe of the Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which performed throughout the region through 1981.         After the disbanding of the company, she worked in another administrative capacity with the commission before joining the Pittsburgh ballet company in 1989.         During her five years there, she helped to found an innovative dance therapy program.         She is survived by her husband, Richard, of Nashville; three daughters, Gretchen Hannah of Nashville and Cary Louise and Rebecca Aileen, both of Pittsburgh; her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Stack of Hyattsville, Md.; two sisters, Judith Overman of Columbia, Md., and Carol Tilford of Fairfax, Va., and a brother, Kenneth Stack Jr. of Laurel, Md.       
         Tess Hyman, whose efforts for nearly a half-century on behalf of fans in wheelchairs attending Giants and Jets football games earned her the nickname Tess of the Meadowlands, died yesterday morning at her home in Deerfield Beach, Fla. She was 92.         Until recent years, on any game day, Mrs. Hyman could be seen at Gate B at Giants Stadium, insuring smooth passage for the approximately 200 fans in wheelchairs and their escorts who attended the home games of the two New York area franchises in the National Football League.         Once in the stadium, she became what one paraplegic once called ''a mom to 250 kids.''         Mrs. Hyman's work was a continuation of a program started for disabled veterans more than 50 years ago by the late Dr. N. Howard Hyman, the dentist Mrs. Hyman met soon after her arrival in New York from West Virginia. She had broken a tooth on an oyster shell and he was the dentist to whom she was referred.         Soon, the two were not only courting but also working with the disabled at sporting events. Seven years after the dental appointment, and many years after escorting not only disabled veterans but any wheelchair-bound fans to games, the two were married.         The Hymans first oversaw the attendance of disabled veterans at Giants games at the Polo Grounds, then followed the team's migration to Yankee Stadium in 1956, then Giants Stadium in 1976. Soon, their efforts encompassed Jets games as well.         At first, the Hymans paid all expenses. Then more help arrived, first in small bequests from patients' wills, then finally through Preston Robert Tisch, who owns 50 percent of the Giants and who married Joan Hyman, Dr. Hyman's daughter from his first marriage.         So while her husband, whom everyone called Doc, attended to the tickets and logistics, Mrs. Hyman served cake and coffee and became a troubleshooter, all the while marveling at the medicinal effect a sport could have on those who had lost limbs, sight or the ability to walk.         ''Sometimes when they get excited, they almost stand up in their wheelchairs,'' Mrs. Hyman once said.         Mrs. Hyman was also impressed by the inner strength the disabled displayed over the years. ''They're better than regular guys,'' she said. ''Regular guys bellyache about the least little thing. These guys are grateful for what they've got left.''         She assumed control of the program in the 1980's upon her husband's death. Several years ago, both the Giants and the Jets dedicated a special section of their shared stadium to the couple.         Though she had attended hundreds of games, Mrs. Hyman admitted that she never really watched them. ''I don't understand football,'' she said in a 1991 interview. ''I've never been able to see a game through. I'm always getting up and trying to straighten something out.''         She is survived by her sister, Kathryn Parsont, and her stepdaughter, Joan.       
         Rosalie Ulrich Rosenberger, who practiced law in Nassau County for nearly seven decades, starting even before the county bar association admitted women, died on Sunday at South Nassau Community Hospital in Oceanside, L.I. She was 97 and a 60-year resident of Rockville Centre.         A woman ahead of her time, she carried on a general practice in Rockville Centre under her maiden name of Rosalie Ulrich until she retired about six years ago. She was long active in community affairs, especially low-income housing and the welfare of the elderly.         She was born and reared in Manhattan and received her law degree from Cornell University in 1921. She was admitted to the state bar two years later. She began her practice then, but the Nassau County bar refused to admit her when she applied in 1938. Undeterred, she was among the founders of the Nassau County Women's Bar Association. In fairly short order, the men who ran the county bar opened their ranks to female lawyers.         Her community interests prompted Mrs. Rosenberger to form the Better Housing Committee of Rockville Centre in 1953, which campaigned for affordable housing for less affluent families. She then served as chairwoman of the local housing authority, until the early 1960's. In those years she helped develop the Halandia housing project for senior citizens in Rockville Centre, one of the first such centers in the county.         In her law practice, Mrs. Rosenberger worked on behalf of youthful offenders, and she later served as a law guardian in the Nassau County Children's Court before the establishment of Family Court in Westbury.         She also was a president of the Nassau Senior Forum and the National Council of Jewish Women.         She is survived by two daughters, Susan Peters of Deer Park, L.I., and Betty Roberts of Stamford, Conn.; five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Ratner Miller, a Cleveland business woman and civic leader, died on Tuesday at the Cleveland Clinic. She was 70 and a lifelong  resident of the city.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         At her death she was president of Tower City Center, part of a complex of buildings in downtown Cleveland. Topped by a 32-story structure, it contains office space, retail businesses, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and a multiscreen movie house.         Tower City was built by her family's Forest City Enterprises, a national real-estate developer. Its New York affiliate, the Forest City Ratner Companies, is involved in several projects in Brooklyn, including Metrotech and the new Atlantic Center shopping mall.         Mrs. Miller, a member of numerous civic and community groups, contributed to causes serving women's causes, Jewish philanthropies and the State of Israel. She was a board member of the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the National Jewish Coalition and a trustee of Cleveland State University and the Western Reserve Historical Society.         For her work in support of Israel Bonds she received its David Ben-Gurion Award in 1977. She received the American Jewish Committee's Human Relations Award and the Distinguished Community Service Award from Brandeis University.         She graduated from Case Western Reserve University, where she earned a Ph.D. in guidance and counseling, and lectured in educational psychology at Case Western from 1969 to 1974. That year she joined the administration of Mayor Ralph J. Perk as director of community development and, later, director of public health and welfare.         Mrs. Miller is survived by her second husband, Rabbi Philip Horowitz; three sons, Aaron Miller of Washington, Richard Miller of Boston and Abraham Miller of Cleveland; a daughter, Gabrielle Miller of Wellesley, Mass.; a brother, Albert B. Ratner, of Cleveland, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Mary Cooper Jewett Gaiser, a philanthropist who served on the boards of nonprofit institutions in the fields of education, community service and the arts, died on Sunday at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane, Wash. She was 95 and lived in Spokane.         Over the years, Mrs. Gaiser (pronounced like ''geyser'') served on the boards of numerous institutions that were beneficiaries of her largess. She was a trustee of Wellesley College, of which she was an alumna, for 18 years. She was active in fund-raising for Wellesley, and its Jewett Art Center is named for her first husband, George Frederick Jewett, who died in 1956. He was chairman and president of Potlatch Forests, a forest-products concern based in Lewiston, Idaho. .         Her philanthropy extended to other educational institutions, including the American University of Beirut, Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif., all of which she served as a trustee. Mrs. Gaiser had been on the national board of the Young Women's Christian Association since the late 1940's. ''Women are wonderful,'' she once declared. ''Like tea bags, they never know their strength until they get into hot water.''         She was president of the Spokane Y.W.C.A. during World War II, and oversaw programs to help women and children with problems related to the war. In addition, she was on the boards of the Spokane Arts Commission, which she helped set up, and of what is now the Spokane Symphony orchestra, in whose founding she was instrumental. In 1987, after donating $225,000 to the orchestra's endowment, she said: ''Half the fun of life is sharing. People are missing a lot of satisfaction if they don't get pleasure from using their abilities to help others.''         She and Mr. Jewett also played an important role in the construction of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Spokane.         A doctor's daughter, Mrs. Gaiser was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1923, and taught school in Bronxville, N.Y. until she married Mr. Jewett in 1925. They lived in communities in Idaho until they moved to Spokane in 1937. She married Dr. David Wesley Gaiser, a surgeon, in 1961, and he died in 1985.         Mrs. Gaiser is survived by a son, George Frederick Jewett Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter, Margaret Jewett Greer of Chevy Chase, Md.; six grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; a sister, Janet Cooper Dakin of Irvington, Va., and a brother, Dr. William Grant Cooper Jr., of Little Rock, Ark.       
         Peggy Wattles Pulleyn, whose grandchild's ill fortune moved her to found the Princeton Child Development Institute in 1970, died on Dec. 8 in a freakish accident near her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 85.         According to the Somerset County Prosecutor's office, she was walking on a road in Bedminster when a car driven by a longtime friend, Allison Ewing, backing up to meet her, lurched out of control and struck her. No charges were filed against Mrs. Ewing, 76, who is the wife of New Jersey's senior State Senator, John H. Ewing of Bernardsville.         The institute in Princeton, now caring for about 40 autistic children, has grown into a nationally recognized center that has served as a model elsewhere in the country. Its science-based program, backed by research and staff training, was recognized by the Federal Government in 1983 when it cited the Institute as one of 60 exemplary private schools in the country.         Mrs. Pulleyn felt the need for such a school in 1968 when her family realized that her first grandson, Rollie, was autistic, a still-enigmatic condition with many associated disorders. Her search for a suitable program for the child led her, her daughter and some other parents in the Princeton region to start their own school.         From modest beginnings with 17 children, the institute moved into its own home in Princeton, where a further addition was completed this year. Mrs. Pulleyn was an original board member.         She served as its longtime chairwoman, raising funds for the state-supported institute. Up to her death, she remained active on the board, and was also active in another project: the Magic Shop in Oldwick.         Founded just after World War II, it is a gift shop that initially assisted returning veterans. Since then, it has been a financial supporter of the nearby Bonnie Brae Home for Boys, a boarding institution that teaches troubled children academic subjects and trade skills.         Mrs. Pulleyn, an amateur artist, contributed her work and staffed the counter to sell the Magic Shop's wide variety of children's clothing and other handmade materials. The day before her death, she suited up the shop's Santa for the season.         Peggy Wattles grew up in Buffalo and graduated from Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y. She was an outstanding amateur golfer who won New York State championships in the 1930's and twice reached the quarterfinals of the United States Women's National Golf Tournament.         Mrs. Pulleyn's husband, Robert, a lawyer, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Pamela Pulleyn Machold of Princeton; a brother, Gurdon W. Wattles of Oldwick; a sister, Elizabeth Wattles of Hightstown, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Marjory Banks Grannis, a lecturer and community volunteer, died last Saturday at her home in Lake Bluff, Ill. She was 80 and also had a summer home in Edgartown, Mass.         Mrs. Grannis was the mother of the New York State Assemblyman Alexander B. (Pete) Grannis, who represents the Upper East Side. She grew up in New York City and Suffern, N.Y., and attended art school in Florence.         In 1991, she helped write and publish ''Visiting the Midwest Historical Preservation Sites,'' a guide to towns of historical and architectural interest within a day's drive of Chicago. For many years she was active in the English-Speaking Union of the United States, serving on the national board of governors and as president of the Chicago branch.         She worked with the Junior Leagues of New York, Chicago and Birmingham, Mich., where was president. As a member of the Colonial Dames of America, she helped refurbish Widow Clark House, Chicago's oldest standing house, which is now a museum.         Besides Assemblyman Grannis, she is survived by her husband of 56 years, Uri Balcom Grannis; two other sons, Uri B. 3d, of Petoskey, Mich., and Jonathan G., of Winnetka, Ill.; a sister, Elspeth B. Furlaud of New York City, six grandchildren and a step-grandson.       
         Dr. Margaret Jeffrey Rioch, a clinical psychologist who developed an innovative training program in psychotherapy, died on Nov. 25 at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 89.         Dr. Rioch was a professor emeritus of psychology at American University here. She was one of the first Western psychologists to be trained in Zen teaching under Dr. Hubert Benoit in Paris.         In the 1960's, while working at the National Institute of Mental Health, she developed a training program for middle-aged women seeking to pursue careers in psychotherapy. She believed that this would create opportunities for women in search of careers or those who sought to return to the workplace. It later became the model for programs around the country.         Dr. Rioch also founded and directed the A. K Rice Institute, an organization that studied group relations.         Dr. Rioch, a native of Paterson, N.J., graduated from Wellesley College and received a master's degree and doctorate in philology from Bryn Mawr College. She trained at the Washington School of Psychiatry.         Dr. David Rioch, her husband, died in 1985. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Helen Wilson, a staunch advocate of patients' rights as administrator for the Association of the Attending Staff at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died yesterday at the hospital. Mrs. Wilson, who lived on the Upper East Side, was 82.         The cause was cancer, a daughter, Victoria Wilson, said.         Working with the practicing physicians at Mount Sinai for more than 20 years, Mrs. Wilson was a champion of better patient care and increased respect for nurses.         Mrs. Wilson retired in 1984. At the time, she held the titles of secretary to the medical board, secretary to the board of trustees and head of the medical staff services office, in addition to that of administrator for the Association  of the Attending Staff.         The Association of the Attending Staff persuaded Mrs. Wilson to stay on, and  she continued as the organization's administrator until her death.         Mrs. Wilson joined Mount Sinai in 1962 as administrative assistant to the director of nurses. After a few years, she left briefly to work as a theater producer, but she returned in the late 60's and remained.         Mrs. Wilson was born in Manhattan and educated at the Dalton School, the University of Wisconsin and Hunter College.         Always an activist, she was involved in anti-Fascist causes during the Spanish Civil War, supported Russian War Relief and was often seen on picket lines.         In the early 1950's, after her marriage to the novelist and physicist Mitchell Wilson, which was to end in divorce, the couple lived on Martha's Vineyard for several years.         At that time, Mrs. Wilson gave up her work as administrative assistant to the president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and with her husband founded the Martha's Vineyard Little Theater, where they produced and directed plays.         In addition to her daughter Victoria, of Manhattan, Mrs. Wilson is survived by another daughter, Erica Silverman, also of Manhattan.       
         Barbara Jordan, the black Congresswoman and scholar who stirred the nation with her Churchillian denunciations of the Watergate abuses of President Richard M. Nixon, died today in her home state of Texas at the age of 59.         Afflicted with multiple sclerosis, Ms. Jordan died from viral pneumonia as a  complication of leukemia, according to officials of the University of Texas in Austin, where she taught.         Ms. Jordan, the first black elected to Congress from Texas after Reconstruction, retired from the House in 1979 after three terms to teach political ethics at the university's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, never losing her potent talent for public speaking even from the confines of a wheelchair.         Most recently, her rich, impassioned voice was heard once more in Congress when, as chairwoman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, she spoke out last  year against a proposal to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants born in this country. "To deny birthright citizenship would derail this engine of American liberty," she warned with the same eloquence that mesmerized her American audience on July 25, 1974, when Representative Jordan argued for the impeachment of President Nixon.         Ms. Jordan, whom her students recalled as never being without a copy of the Constitution in her purse, rooted that Watergate speech in her faith in the Constitution's promise and in her personal history as a child of the Jim Crow South.         "I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton  just left me out by mistake," she declared, catching the nation's attention with measured, sepulchral oratory from her seat on the House Judiciary Committee. "But through the process of amendment, interpretation and court decision I have  finally been included in 'We, the people.' "         Then, with a smoldering glance across the proceedings of the historic Constitutional crisis, Ms. Jordan added, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total, and I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution."         Ms. Jordan was one of American politics' pioneer black women. In 1966, she was elected as the first black state Senator in Texas, and went on to be the first woman and first black elected to Congress from Texas. In 1976, she was the first black woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, riveting her audience on national television as she spoke magisterially from the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden.         "All blacks are militant in their guts," she told an interviewer during her first Congressional campaign. "But militancy is expressed in different ways."         As a model of the Democratic politician from the New South, Ms. Jordan was less an angry or confrontational liberal than an imposing master of the process  and its details. A consummate politician from her earliest days in the Texas Legislature, Ms. Jordan won a seat on the House Judiciary Committee though only  a freshman by importuning her political mentor and friend, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, to pull some strings.         "She proved that black is beautiful before we knew what it meant," Mr. Johnson said of her. His widow, Lady Bird Johnson, led Texans in mourning their  native daughter. "I feel a stabbing sense of loss at the passing of a good friend," Mrs. Johnson said today.         Ms. Jordan's political prowess saw her ascend to the post of Speaker pro tem  in the Texas Senate six years after having arrived there as a political oddity and an outcast.         The youngest of three sisters, Barbara Charline Jordan was born on Feb. 21, 1936, into the poverty of Houston's Fourth Ward. She attended Houston's segregated public schools and graduated magna cum laude with debating honors from the all-black Texas Southern University. Her father, Benjamin, a Baptist minister, moonlighted as a warehouse clerk to help her pay for college, where her scholarship and assertiveness were honed.         As leader of the debating team, Ms. Jordan, known as B. J. to her friends, later proudly recalled maneuvering the Harvard team to a draw. "When an all-black team ties Harvard, it wins," she said.         Ms. Jordan received a law degree in 1959 from Boston University and was soon  at practice from her family's dining-room table. Eventually, she had a second-story office above a print shop near her family's simple frame house.         "I never wanted to be run of the mill," she told Molly Ivins, the Texas writer who was a friend since 1969 and likened interviewing Ms. Jordan to "a bit like grilling God" because of the care, scholarship and booming authority of her speech.         "We were poor," Ms. Jordan said of her strict but loving upbringing. "But so  was everyone around us, so we did not notice it."         When Miss Jordan was 11, she quit her piano lessons -- a defiant act that angered her father. He told her that the only good jobs for black women were in  teaching music or in performing, and asked her what she intended to do if she could not play the piano. "I don't know," she recalled telling him, "but I'll manage somehow."         As a Congressional newcomer, Ms. Jordan served notice that she had received 80 percent of the vote and would therefore have far broader interests than the Black Caucus agenda, and would hardly be a "female chauvinist."         "You know, Barbara wasn't really that concerned about the guilt or innocence  of Nixon," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who served with Ms. Jordan on the impeachment hearings. "She was most concerned that the Constitution not be distorted for political reasons."         Some of Ms. Jordan's earliest politicking was as a young lawyer when she directed one of Houston's first voter drives in support of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960. She lost her first two bids for elective office in rough-and-tumble, racism-tinged bouts. But she succeeded when state legislative  districts were finally redrawn and she became the first black of either sex to be elected to the Texas Senate since 1883.         Even amid the political turmoil of 1974, when Congresswoman Jordan contended  that the Watergate conspirings had put the nation "on the edge of repression and tyranny," the outspoken Texan still led with her optimism. During that summer of the Watergate crisis, she took care to visit the graduates of Howard University  and urge them: "Reaffirm what ought to be. Get back to the truth; that's old, but get back to it. Get back to what's honest; tell government to do that. Affirm the civil liberties of the people of this country. Do that."         Ms. Jordan is survived by her mother, Arylenne; two sisters, Bennie Creswell  and Rose Mary McGowan, and a brother-in-law, John McGowan, all of Houston.       
         Elizabeth Clementine Miller Tangeman, a philanthropist and matriarch of a leading Indiana industrial family, died on Wednesday at her home in Columbus, Ind. She was 90.         At her death she was chairwoman of the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation of Columbus, a major regional donor to the arts, Christian education, social services, child welfare and community development. A family foundation, it reported grants of more than $1.65 million in the 1992 fiscal year.         In 1919, the Miller family founded the Cummins Engine Company of Columbus, which grew into the world's largest independent maker of diesel engines, with annual revenue of more than $4 billion and a payroll of more than 23,000. The company earned a national reputation for corporate good works, including paying  for renowned architects to design public buildings for Columbus, leading the town to style itself "the Athens of the prairie."         Born in Columbus, Mrs. Tangeman graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1927. She served as a trustee of Butler University, the Christian Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary.         She had a lifelong interest in Scouting and was a past director of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and a trustee of the World Foundation for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. Her dedication to music led her to help establish the Institute of  Sacred Music at Yale University in 1973.         Mrs. Tangeman is survived by a stepson, John T. Tangeman of Kansas City, Mo.; a brother, J. Irwin Miller, the former chairman of Cummins Engine, and a stepgranddaughter. Her husband, Prof. Robert S. Tangeman, died in 1964.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Monroe Boggs, a co-founder and past president of the Association for Retarded Citizens, died on Saturday at Cooper Medical Center in  Camden, N.J. She was 82 and a resident of Hampton, N.J.         She died of injuries sustained on Jan. 21 when she lost control of her car on an icy road near her home, said Dr. Deborah Spitalnik, a close friend and colleague.         Dr. Boggs, who became known around the country as the First Lady of the A.R.C., was active as a volunteer and advocate for four decades.  She served as  president of the organization in 1958, when it was known as the National Association for Retarded Children.         Since it was founded in 1950, the association, which now has its headquarters in Arlington, Tex., has grown to about 140,000 members, 46 state chapters and a  staff of 45. The membership consists of parents, professional workers and advocates for the mentally retarded, with the mission of promoting services, research, public understanding and legislation.         Dr. Boggs was the principal architect of Federal legislation that expanded the definition of disabilities to include people with physical handicaps. Previously, certain Federal programs served only people who were mentally retarded. She also helped develop legislation in Trenton that led to turning the New Jersey Division of Mental Retardation into the Division of Developmental Disabilities, again benefiting a broader population.         President John F. Kennedy named her to a Federal panel that studied the problems of mental retardation and advised on what action to take. The recommendations led to legisLation.         Dr. Boggs, who described herself as a "nonprofessional mover and shaker," was born in Cleveland and graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1935.         Her chosen field was theoretical chemistry. She went to England and received  a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. She began her career in World War II as a researcher at what is now Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.         She married Dr. Fitzhugh Boggs, a fellow scientist, in 1941 and gave birth to their son, David, in 1945. It soon became apparent that David had sustained brain damage during a severe illness he suffered in infancy.         She took courses in special education and joined with other parents to organize on the county and then the state level. David's mental retardation left him with only limited use of his arms and legs, but Dr. Boggs and her husband tried to care for him at home. When they had to place him in a residential center in 1952, she made a hard choice between the laboratory coat and the mantle of public advocate.         Dr. Boggs is survived by David, a resident of the Hunterdon Developmental Center in Clinton, N.J. Fitzhugh Boggs died in 1971.       
         Rebecca LaBrecque, a pianist who championed new music and new ways of using the keyboard in a classical concert setting, died on Sunday at Calpary Hospital  in the Bronx. She was 45 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a series of brain tumors, Ms. LaBrecque's sister, Sandra T. Parsons, said.         Beginning in the mid-1970's, Ms. LaBrecque was heard regularly in New York concert halls playing contemporary works as both soloist and chamber player. A musician who was able to quickly assimilate difficult music and perform it persuasively, Ms. LaBrecque was regularly called upon to perform in composer retrospectives. She commissioned more than 60 works, and revived many neglected  20th-century scores.         One of these was the Roger Sessions Piano Concerto, which Ms. LaBrecque performed with the American Composers Orchestra in 1984. It had been performed only twice since Sessions composed it in 1958. In the same concert, she gave the premieres of concertos composed for her by Joseph Manieri and Daniel Brewbaker.  In 1988 she revived Henry Cowell's 1929 Piano Concerto for a performance with the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center.         Ms. LaBrecque's connection with the music of Sessions went beyond the concerto. With the composer supervising, she recorded all of his Piano Sonatas.  Her recordings also included the works of Frank Martin and David Froom.         One of Ms. LaBrecque's most unusual performances was a 1986 recital at Merkin Concert Hall in which she simultaneously played the piano and a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. The program was devoted to works she commissioned for the occasion, insisting that the composers write for both instruments.         Ms. LaBrecque was born in Torrington, Conn., on April 28, 1950, and studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and at the State University at Stony Brook.         In addition to Ms. Parsons, of Harwinton, Conn., Ms. LaBrecque is survived by her father, Maurice, of San Diego, and four other sisters: Natalie Marghuardt of San Diego, Mary Louise Cassidy of Naugatuck, Conn., Penny Kindt of Seattle and Florence Fancett of Michigan.       
         Felice N. Schwartz, who was active for more than three decades in the advancement of women in the workplace, and whose writing focused debate over the career model known as the "mommy track," died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She died of heart failure after a long illness, said her son Tony.         Mrs. Schwartz was the founder of Catalyst, a national organization that was  dedicated to helping women choose and advance careers and that later promoted the participation of women in corporations and their recruitment on corporate boards. She remained its president for 30 years, retiring in 1993.         She prompted a national debate in 1989 with an article in the Harvard Business Review that asserted it cost companies more to employ women than men. She noted that women's careers were often interrupted, or ended, when they had children and suggested that employers create policies to help mothers balance career and family responsibilities by giving them more flexibility in work hours and providing high-quality day care.         An uproar began almost immediately. Her proposed alternative career track came to be called the "mommy track." Detractors voiced the fear that by raising  the higher cost issue, women would not be hired and promoted and that all women  would be left with the primary responsibility for child care. Mrs. Schwartz said her views were widely misinterpreted.         "I violated the politically correct thing by saying that women are not just like men, " Mrs. Schwartz maintained in an interview in The Boston Globe in 1992. "What I said then and still say is that women face many, many obstacles in the workplace that men do not face. I was saying to that group of men at the top, 'Rather than let women's talents go to waste, do something about it.' "         She believed, she said, that there should be a parent track. "When a woman is faced with doing all the housework, all the child care and then full-time work in the corporate area, she is stunted. The same applies to men."         The daughter of Albert and Rose Nierenberg of New York, she first became involved in social causes while an undergraduate at Smith College. In 1945, she  founded the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students. The organization lobbied colleges and universities to open their doors to minorities and provided financial aid for college bound African-American students.         Catalyst, founded in 1962 after Mrs. Schwartz had spent a decade at home raising her children, focused in its early years on lobbying employers to allow  women to combine family and part-time work. The organization pioneered several job-sharing pilot projects in which two women shared a full-time job. It also undertook studies on family issues in the workplace.         In 1968, Mrs. Schwartz wrote "How to Go to Work When Your Husband Is Against  It, Your Children Aren't Old Enough and There's Nothing You Can Do Anyhow." A second book, "Breaking With Tradition: Women and Work, the New Facts of Life," was published in 1992. Last month, she finished writing "The Armchair Activist:  Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right." It will be published this  fall.         She was married in 1946 to Irving L. Schwartz, a scientist, educator and physician.         During the early years of her marriage, Mrs. Schwartz and her husband had what might have been one of the early commuter marriages. The family moved to Cincinnati where Dr. Schwartz had been offered a post at a medical school. Mrs.  Schwartz, who was planning the organization that later became Catalyst, believed that it had to be launched in New York. She returned with her three children and Dr. Schwartz spent the next two years flying back and forth on weekends.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Cassie Arnold of Washington; two  sons, Tony Schwartz of New York City and James Schwartz of Boston; a brother, Theodore Nierenberg of Armonk, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Dorothea J. Steindl, who espoused Jewish causes for more than four decades, died on Monday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y., of cancer. She was 71.         Mrs. Steindl was born Dorothea J. Kahn in Far Rockaway, Queens. In 1953, she  joined the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, which assists Jewish people around the world. She helped organize its White Plains chapter and was a vice president of the Westchester Region and a national board member.         Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, she lobbied for Jewish emigration from the country as a member of the Greater New York Conference for Soviet Jewry. More recently, she worked to help Jewish immigrants settle in New York.         Mrs. Steindl is survived by a daughter, Ethel J. Steindl of Manhattan, and her companion, Ira Adler of Scarsdale. Her husband, Emanuel Steindl, a Westchester real-estate developer, died in 1980.       
         Kathryn Marie Hemphill, a top golfer in the 1930's and 40's, died on Wednesday. She was 84.         Hemphill, who was born in Hattiesburg, Miss., and grew up in Columbia, reached the semifinals of the national amateur championship in 1936 and '37. The next year, she was selected for the United States Curtis Cup team. She won a point for the United States, which defeated Britain 5 1/2 to 3 1/2 in Manchester, Mass.         She turned professional in 1946 and moved to Greensboro, N.C. Four years later, she returned to Columbia and went to work for a bank, retiring in 1977.         She was a member of the Women's Golf Hall of Fame in Augusta, Ga.       
         Eleanor Clark, an author best known for the evocative range of her accounts of oystering in Brittany and of the streets of Rome, died on Friday at a retirement home in Boston. She was 82.         Miss Clark, the widow of Robert Penn Warren, was a master stylist whose works won critical acclaim and inspired a devoted private following. Her writings included reviews, essays, children's books and novels.         In a review in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called a 1975 reissue of  her 1952 book "Rome and the Villa" "perhaps the finest book ever to be written about a city."         But the most telling tributes came from the generations of American and other tourists who followed her steps -- page by dogeared page -- through the city, marveling at each architectural feature that triggered her soaring ruminations on everything from ancient history and early Roman poetry to modern social conditions.         Although she was sometimes described as a travel writer, "Rome and a Villa" is not a traditional travel book. Nor is "The Oysters of Locmariaquer," a somewhat similar book that used oystering in Brittany as a springboard to an excursion through history and culture, and won the 1964 National Book Award for  arts and letters. Each reflected deep scholarship and a lively intuition.         Both in those books and in her norels, including "Baldur's Gate" (1970) and "Camping Out" (1986), Miss Clark seemed especially moved by landscape, an interest that was grounded in her childhood amid the rolling hills around Roxbury, Conn., her daughter, the poet Rosanna Clark, said yesterday.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Clark was a descendant of early New England settlers. Her father was a mining engineer, and she seems to have inherited her  literary and scholarly bent from her mother, a Vassar graduate steeped in comparative literature.         Miss Clark also attended Vassar and spent much of her time during her college years on visits to Manhattan. She later became a conspicuous part of the city's  intellectual left, writing for The Partisan Review, The New Republic and The Nation. She was viewed as independent-minded with a youthful social conscience and regarded herself for a time as "a Trotskyite sympathizer."         During a trip to Mexico in 1937 she became a translator for Trotsky and was married to one of his secretaries for a brief time.         During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, interviewing French and Italian diplomats. It was at a party at Katherine Anne Porter's home in the spring of 1944 that she met Mr. Warren, then in the last stages of an unhappy first marriage.         Although she recounted later that she had pursued him, once confiding that it had taken all her guile to get a simple good-night kiss, at the first meeting he seems to have been more taken with her than she with him.  She left the party with one of his friends, the poet Denis Devlin, and, as Mr. Warren later railed  in recounting the meeting to his children, "a bunch of other drunken Irishmen."         After their marriage in 1952, they traveled widely and found a formula for pursuing their separate literary careers. Working in different studies of the converted 17th-century barn that served as their home in Fairfield, Conn., they  wrote from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. daily, she using the typewriter in the companionship of their cat, he writing in longhand accompanied by their dog.         When Miss Clark was stricken with macular degeneration and almost totally lost her eyesight (a setback described in "Eyes, Etc.," her 1977 memoir), her husband began reading to her at night. He died in 1989.         In addition to her daughter, of Needham, Mass., she is survived by a son, Gabriel, a sculptor, of Wood River Junction, R.I., and four grandchildren.
