         Therese Thau Heyman, a curator of photographs, graphic art and drawings and an expert on American photographic history, died Friday in Berkeley, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was pneumonia, said John Cummings, associate chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, where I. Michael Heyman, Mrs. Heyman's husband, is a former chancellor and a professor at the law school.         Over the years, Mrs. Heyman worked at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum of American Art and the Oakland Museum of California. She was also on the board of the Smith College Museum of Art and on staff at the Yale Art Museum, where she was a curatorial assistant.         She helped write or contributed to several books, including ''Dorothea Lang: American Photographs,'' ''On the Edge of America: California Modernist Art, 1900-1950'' and ''Picturing California: A Century of Photographic Genius.''         In her career she spread awareness and appreciation of art, particularly California's photographic art. ''You often hear people say there is no American art, but this isn't so,'' she told an interviewer in 1980, according to a statement from the office of the chancellor at Berkeley.         Mrs. Heyman was born in Manhattan and attended Smith College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1951, and Yale, where she graduated in 1958 with a master's degree.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son James and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist and self-help author whose books touched on identity, resolving stress and the grief occasioned by the World Trade Center attacks, died on Jan. 10 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. She was 55.         The cause was respiratory failure after pneumonia, said her husband, Steven Fink.         One of her books, ''The Type E Woman,'' published in 1986, described the stresses of balancing a career and family. Dr. Braiker's literary agent, Alice Martel, said the ''E'' represented the woman who tried to be ''everything to everybody.'' The book was a response to research into the Type A personality so often associated with hard-driving men. It was Dr. Braiker's favorite through the years, Mr. Fink said.         In another book, ''The Disease to Please,'' she described a destructive propensity that drives people, usually women, to serve others to the detriment of their own well-being.         In the introduction to ''The September 11 Syndrome,'' published four months after the 2001 attacks, she described the premise of the book as helping readers turn ''our collective emotional adversity'' into their own psychological victories. The book prescribed steps to control feelings of helplessness and anxiety awakened by terrorism.         Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who met Dr. Braiker in graduate school, said she ''brought an extremely strong theoretical background to popular writing.''         ''Her books took problems that were common and subliminal and put them out in the open,'' Dr. Jamison said.         Harriet Beryl Braiker was born in Los Angeles. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and won a National Science Foundation research scholarship. In 1975, she received a doctorate in clinical and social psychology from U.C.L.A.         Before establishing a private practice in 1980, Dr. Braiker worked at the RAND Corporation, analyzing health policies for the federal government. She later became a contributing editor for Working Woman and a columnist for Lear's magazine. She also appeared on television and radio talk shows and was an expert witness in legal cases on sexual harassment.         Although her earliest works examined alcoholism, depression and destructive relationships, her most recent book, ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?'' (2003), was a study of manipulation.         In addition to her husband, surviving are their daughter, Amanda Fink, also of Pasadena; a stepson, Stuart, of New York; and a brother, Dr. Barry Braiker of Beverly Hills, Calif.       
         Dr. Gertie F. Marx, a New York anesthesiologist who helped advance the use of modern epidural injections that ease women's pain during childbirth, died on Sunday at the Schervier Nursing Care Center in the Bronx, according to Dr. Jill M. Rabin, a friend and colleague. Dr. Marx was 91.         At a time when anesthesia was reserved for complicated deliveries and Caesarean sections, Dr. Marx became an early and vigorous advocate of what became known as the epidural and helped show that it was safe and effective. The procedure places a catheter next to a patient's spine, allowing a sedative to block the sensation of pain without paralyzing the birth canal.         Dr. Marx worked at Beth Israel Hospital for more than a decade before joining the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in 1955. For the next four decades, she continued her clinical practice and research at Einstein. She developed an epidural needle that bears her name and became the founding editor of Obstetric Anesthesia Digest, the original publication in the field.         Before Dr. Marx, a doctor might or might not have given sedation or pain relief in childbirth, said Dr. Paul L. Goldiner, chairman of the anesthesiology department at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. ''She single-handedly pushed the development of obstetric anesthesiology as a specialty.''         Gertie Florentine Marx was born in Frankfurt and left Germany in the 1930's, after the Nazi government began to deny Jews entrance to universities. She received her medical degree from the University of Bern, in Switzerland, in 1937, before immigrating to the United States.         Dr. Marx later married Eric Reiss, a radiological technician whom she had met in Germany, said Dr. Goldiner. Mr. Reiss died in the 1960's, and the couple had no children.         In 1993, Dr. Marx was awarded a College Medal from the Royal College of Anaesthetists, in a presentation made by Queen Elizabeth II. She was a fellow of the American College of Anesthesiologists and an associate fellow of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She received a distinguished service award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.         Dr. Marx became a professor emerita at Einstein in 1995, and spent most of her time at home in Southbury, Conn., before recently moving to an assisted-living facility there.         She is survived by a cousin, Dr. Ronald Simon of New York, and by her close friend and former student, Dr. Rabin, also of New York.       
         Mary A. Gardner, a journalism professor whose teaching had a strong influence on contemporary journalism in Mexico and Latin America, died Jan. 22 in East Lansing, Mich., her sister-in-law, Donna Gardner, said. She was 83.         Dr. Gardner's influence in Mexico stemmed from her connection to a former student, Alejandro Junco de la Vega. Mr. Junco, heir to what was then a small family-owned newspaper company that published El Norte in Monterrey, studied journalism with Dr. Gardner at the University of Texas.         When he took over the family business, he turned to his former teacher to help train his staff in reporting, writing and ethics. For more than 20 years, Dr. Gardner spent her summers training reporters at El Norte.         In the mid-1990's, Mr. Junco started a newspaper in Mexico City, Reforma, incorporating the journalistic principles Dr. Gardner helped to instill at El Norte.         Today, Reforma is regarded by many as Mexico's most influential publication.         ''She had an enormous influence on the quality of journalism in Mexico, and in Latin America as well,'' said Richard Cole, dean of the University of North Carolina journalism school and another former student of Dr. Gardner's.         Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Mary Gardner never intended to be a journalist or a teacher; rather, she aspired to be a physician. A pre-med student at Ohio State University, she was informed that medical school was not an option because she was a woman.         After serving in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II, she earned a master's degree in journalism from Ohio State. In 1960, she received a doctorate in journalism and political science from the University of Minnesota, where she began her teaching career.         In 1961 she moved to the University of Texas, where she was an assistant professor until 1966. She then taught at the Michigan State University School of Journalism until she retired in 1991.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her brother, Porter, of Zoar, Ohio.       
         Susan Schechter, whose books about domestic violence helped to unify the movement to assist battered women and to bridge the gap between programs addressing domestic abuse and those for children's welfare, died Feb. 3 at her home in Iowa City. She was 57.         The cause was endometrial cancer, said her husband, Allen Steinberg.         Mrs. Schecter's 1982 book, ''Women and Male Violence: The Visions and Struggles of the Battered Women's Movement,'' a history and analysis of early efforts against domestic violence, is considered a groundbreaking work.         Mrs. Schechter wrote ''When Love Goes Wrong'' in 1992 with Ann Jones, a journalist. The book was intended as a resource for abused women. In 1999, with Jeffrey L. Edleson, a professor at the University of Minnesota, she wrote a set of guidelines for professionals in civil courts, child welfare services and domestic violence programs.         In her writing, Mrs. Schechter explored the ways domestic abuse affected children.         Susan Schechter was born on May 1, 1946, in St. Louis. She received a bachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis and a master's degree in social work from the University of Illinois at Chicago. After graduating, she helped organize the first shelter for abused women in Chicago. In 1986, at Children's Hospital Boston, she started a program for battered women with abused children. She had been a clinical professor of social work at the University of Iowa since 1993.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Schechter is survived by her son, Zachary.         Correction:  February 20, 2004, Friday  An obituary on Monday about Susan Schechter, an expert on domestic violence, misstated the title she used. She was Ms. Schechter, not Mrs. (Her husband's name was Allen Steinberg.)       
         Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Robert.         In 12 books and many other writings, Dr. McCord, a professor at Temple University, disputed the effectiveness in fighting crime of boys' clubs, summer camps, programs in which young offenders visit prisons, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and other popular programs.         The first woman to be president of the American Society of Criminology, she was known for her use of longitudinal studies, which follow subjects for many years. Her goal was to examine the long-term effects of programs, ranging from individual mentoring programs often favored by conservatives to social work efforts frequently advocated by liberals.         Dr. McCord believed that just as the government monitors the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, the public should examine data to determine if well-meaning interventions to help people might, in fact, be harmful. Often, she found that programs had no built-in procedure to evaluate their success.         More troubling, she said, was that officials sometimes resisted evaluation of programs, in part because they regarded it as an affront to their good intentions. She also said she sensed a fear that solid criticism of one social program might brand all as ineffective.         ''That fear, perhaps justified in some quarters, would be like blocking publication of damaging effects of Celebrex, thalidomide, or estrogen because the publication could slow work in disease prevention,'' she wrote in the May 2003 issue of The Annals, the publication of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.         Her best-known longitudinal study was her 1978 follow-up on a youth-mentoring program done 30 years earlier in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass. She found that boys at high risk who had been given mentors, health-care services and summer camp fared worse in later life than a similar group of boys who were given nothing special. The 250 boys who got special services were more likely to become criminals, have trouble in their jobs and marriages, and become alcoholics, according to court, hospital and other records noted in her study.         A possible reason, Dr. McCord suggested, was that those boys had felt they were given the attention because something was wrong with them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Her theory was that the boys who went to summer camp modeled themselves after camp troublemakers.         The counterintuitive result contradicted the statements of two-thirds of the participants that the program had helped them by giving them better values and keeping them off the streets.         In other studies, she found that some youths counseled by court-appointed volunteers fared worse than those who received no counseling. Her statistical analysis of a program in Australia that provided recreation for troubled adolescents found bad effects. And participants in the Scared Straight program, which takes young offenders from many locales to visit prisons, were arrested more often than a control group, she found.         She said that D.A.R.E., the popular nationwide ''just say no'' drug education program in which law enforcement officers spend time in schools talking about drugs, alcohol and violence, may actually have contributed to drug use, according to her analysis of statistics from the program.         Joan Fish was born in Manhattan on Aug. 4, 1930. After graduating from Stanford in 1952, she did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard and Stanford. She earned her doctorate in sociology from Stanford in 1968.         She wrote some of her early papers with her first husband, William M. McCord. Their marriage ended in divorce. Both he and her second husband, Carl A. Silver, are dead.         Dr. McCord is survived by her sons, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord of Durham, N.C., and Robert McCord of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; her ward, whom she regarded as a family member, Tom Underwood of Boston; her brother, Robert Fish of Santa Cruz, Calif.; her sister, Connie Arnosti of Milwaukee; and four grandsons.         Her often pithy remarks appeared in articles about crime in many newspapers and magazines. The New York Times in 1996 asked her about a 12-year-old arrested on charges of gang rape and murder and who was turned in by his mother.         Of the mother's dilemma, Dr. McCord said, ''It's almost impossible to imagine a good thing to do with a gun-toting 12-year-old.''       
         Rosemary Park Anastos, an advocate for women's education and the liberal arts and a former president of Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women, died April 17 at her home in Los Angeles, said a niece, Joan Citron. She was 97.         Dr. Park, as she was known professionally, came from a family of academics: her mother was a teacher, her father and brother were also college presidents. When she left the Barnard presidency in 1967 after five years, she became the first woman to be a vice chancellor at the University of California. At her Barnard inauguration in 1963, she said that ''to avoid becoming a nursery school to the university with custodial and elementary responsibilities only,'' the college must make its liberal arts more sophisticated. She said that meant moving beyond acquiring facts to the mastery of subjects like advanced mathematics, political and economic theory and classical philosophy.         At Connecticut, where she was president from 1947 to 1962, she expanded the student body by one-third, strengthened the curriculum, built major new buildings and was a tireless fund-raiser. She made the campus a national center for modern dance and generally enhanced the college's reputation. When Yale gave her an honorary degree in 1958, it said she had been a major force in ''adding a bright star to the galaxy of liberal arts colleges for women.''         At Barnard, she followed a similar agenda, strengthening the curriculum, adding major buildings and raising money. But she left after five years, pulled by her marriage in 1965 to Milton Vasil Anastos, a professor of Byzantine Greek at the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in 1997. Dr. Park is survived by her stepson, Milton V. Anastos Jr., of Warwick, R.I., and several nieces and nephews.         Of her departure for California, David Truman, dean of Columbia College, wrote in Barnard's alumnae magazine that although she was the only woman at many Columbia meetings, her wisdom and humor gave weight to her advice and made her ''one of the best men in the university.''         Not all of her dealings with Columbia were harmonious, however, as she related in an interview with Helen S. Astin, a U.C.L.A. colleague, in ''The Higher Education of Women: Essays in Honor of Rosemary Park.'' When she proposed a new science laboratory for Barnard, she said, Columbia discouraged her, saying its labs were sufficient. But, she said, Barnard did not control those labs, and the absence of its own lab would send a signal ''that it didn't believe in science for women.'' Barnard built a new lab.         Born in Andover, Mass., Dr. Park was the oldest of four children of J. Edgar Park, a minister raised in Ireland who became president of Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, and Grace Burtt Park, who taught Greek and mathematics. Her brother, William E. Park, was president of Simmons College, in Boston.         She studied German at Radcliffe and graduated summa cum laude. She later studied at the University of Bonn in 1930 and in 1934 earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cologne. She began teaching German part time, first at Wheaton, then at Connecticut College, where she became dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, then president.         She spoke and wrote widely on education, the role of women and other topics, often breaking from conventional wisdom. She told parents that they should encourage their children to take courses in advanced mathematics and French, because society would need scientists and linguists. She said that schools facing teacher shortages should think about using television and older students to help with the teaching; both, she said, had proved effective.         She often leavened her seriousness with wit. In one speech, she took a swipe at English usage: ''At some point in most of the professions, the regrettable expression 'load' arose: case load, patient load, teaching load,'' she said. ''Artists, as far as I know, do not refer to picture load, poem load or concert load.''         Although she supported women's education, she was not a zealot. In her interview with Dr. Astin, Dr. Park said that women's colleges were ''particularly important for girls who develop slowly,'' but said men might benefit ''from the same kind of protective environment.'' She predicted that women's colleges would become less necessary, and she won authority to establish Connecticut College for Men and then admitted men as graduate students.         She was an energetic fund-raiser at a time when it was not always viewed as dignified. To raise $3.1 million for Connecticut College, she crossed the country, meeting with executives who questioned the need to finance women's education.         She became a vice chancellor at U.C.L.A. in 1967, and then a professor. In 1980, she helped develop the Plato Society, a U.C.L.A. study program for retired people. Until a few months ago, she was a member herself, taking courses like ''Romantic Composers'' and ''Brain and Memory.''       
         Lygia Pape, an influential Brazilian artist who worked in two important movements, Concretism and the looser Neo-Concretism, and later moved beyond them, died on May 3 in Rio de Janeiro. She was 77.         The cause was complications of myelodysplasia, a blood disease, said her daughter Paula Pape.         A restlessly experimental artist, Ms. Pape (pronounced PAH-pay) worked at challenging formal and conceptual limits in many different media, including painting, printmaking, sculpture, dance, film, performance and installation. In the 1950's she was involved in Concretism, which was based on severe abstract styles of European painters like Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich. In 1954 she helped found an important Concretist group called la Frente (the Front).         At the end of the decade she joined her fellow artists Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Clark in founding Neo-Concretism, which rejected the formal remove of Concretist art but retained its insistence on the concrete reality of the artwork as opposed to more representational imagery.         Favoring more interactive relations between art and viewers, the Neo-Concretists sought to expand the formal, expressive and social dimensions of art. Among Ms. Pape's Neo-Concretist works were books with semiabstract sculptural elements that viewers were encouraged to handle.         In a ballet that Ms. Pape choreographed in 1958, simple geometric shapes with people hidden inside moved about the stage. Ten years later she created one of her best-known pieces, ''Divisor,'' a performance work in which dozens of people poked their heads through holes in a gridded arrangement in a large sheet of white cloth. It has been interpreted as a comment on modern bureaucracy as well as on the split between mind and body.         In the 60's Ms. Pape worked with a filmmaking group called Cinema Novo, for which she designed lettering and posters. She also made short experimental films of her own, some only seconds long. In later decades she created large-scale and often surrealistically dramatic installations using lights, plants, food, flowing liquids, fabric and other materials.         Her work was seen in New York in ''Body and Soul,'' a 400-year survey of Brazilian art at the Guggenheim Museum in 2001. Two works from her Neo-Concretist phase are currently on view at El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan in an exhibition of Latin American works from the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Ms. Pape was born on April 7, 1927, in the Novo Friburgo section of Rio. Like many Brazilian artists, she studied studio art informally, but she did receive a master's degree in the philosophy of art from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1980.         From 1972 to 1985, Ms. Pape taught semiotics at the school of architecture at the Universidade Santa Ursula in Rio. She was appointed professor in the school of fine arts of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1983.         In addition to her daughter Paula, Ms. Pape is survived by her husband, Gunther Pape; another daughter, Cristina Maria; and two grandsons.       
         Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, a self-trained South African naturalist who in 1938 discovered the coelacanth, a species of bony, four-finned fish often described as a living fossil, died on May 17 in East London, South Africa. She was 97.         A cause of death was not determined, although she had suffered a series of falls, said Susan L. Jewett, a researcher for the Smithsonian Institution who recently visited her.         The story of Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's discovery remains among the most famous in the annals of modern biology. She was a young curator at the East London Museum when, on Dec. 22, 1938, she spotted the coelacanth in a pile of fish on a vessel at the town's dock. After taking steps to preserve the 127-pound fish, she sent a quick sketch to South Africa's leading fish expert, Dr. J.L.B. Smith of Rhodes University.         ''With that action, Courtenay-Latimer became the point person and den mother for all who were to study the fish,'' said Dr. Keith S. Thomson, professor emeritus of natural history at Oxford University and author of the book ''Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth'' (1991).         Dr. Thomson compared the discovery to finding a lost dinosaur on a South American plateau or a pterodactyl in the Everglades. Before Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's discovery, the coelacanth was thought to have been extinct for at least 70 million years.         As a living species, it is believed to hold a unique place in the evolutionary chain from fish to land vertebrates. Early theories that held that the fish might be a direct ancestor of humankind were disproved by studies in the 1980's of the coelacanth's anatomy and DNA.         ''We continually ask, how can this fish have evolved so little?'' Dr. Thomson said.         Recalling her discovery, Ms. Courtenay-Latimer later wrote: ''I saw a blue fin and, pushing off the fish, the most beautiful fish I had ever seen was revealed. It was five feet long and a pale mauve blue with iridescent silver markings.'' She added, ''This I will definitely take to the museum.''         The second coelacanth was caught 14 years later, in 1952, in the Indian Ocean off the Comoro Islands after an international effort by Dr. Smith to find more specimens of the fish. Some 200 coelacanths have been captured since, leading to a call to study the fish in its environment and to preserve the species. Several were found off the South African coast last month.         The significance of the coelacanth continues to unfold.         Dr. William E. Bemis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said studies of the fish's eye muscles, used to close its jaws, had provided important links to how similar muscles in frogs and vertebrates worked. Other studies have shown that the fish possesses within its snout an electrosensory organ, the rostral organ, which scientists have determined is probably used to find prey.         Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer was born Feb. 24, 1907, the daughter of a railroad accountant who moved the family to stations throughout South Africa. While still a child, she began a collection of bird eggs and insects. She was educated at a convent school and intended to train as a nurse, but became curator at the East London Museum in 1931, a position she held until 1973. She never married.         Although best known for her discovery of the coelacanth, Ms. Courtenay-Latimer had a broader interest in natural history, and also wrote about wildflowers.         In 1971, she received an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University. In 1998, she was a guest of honor when the South African government unveiled a gold coin minted to commemorate the coelacanth's discovery. Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's scientific collaborator, Dr. Smith, named the species after her, Latimeria chalumnae.         Ms. Courtenay-Latimer is survived by two nieces and a nephew.       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Anne Coffin Hanson, an art historian and curator and the first woman to be hired as a full tenured professor at Yale, died yesterday at her home in New Haven. She was 82.         Her death was announced by the Yale University Gallery of Art.         Prof. Hanson was an authority on late-19th-century and early-20th-century European art, specifically the paintings of Édouard Manet and the multifarious Italian Futurists.         During more than two decades at Yale she also organized and wrote catalogs for numerous exhibitions at the Yale University Art Gallery, including ''The Futurist Imagination: Word + Image in Italian Futurist Painting, Drawing, Collage and Free-Word Poetry'' in 1983 and ''Severini Futurista, 1912-1917'' in 1995.         Her best-known book was ''Manet and the Modern Tradition'' (Yale, 1977), which won the Charles Rufus Morey Award for art history scholarship.         Professor Hanson's presence as a teacher, role model and mentor inspired many students, especially women, to become art historians and curators.         Elizabeth Easton, curator of European painting at the Brooklyn Museum, who studied with her at Yale in the late 1970's, said yesterday in an e-mail message that her teaching never prescribed a particular method or course of study, but worked from her students' initiatives -- ''in the way our minds worked'' -- to help them realize the best, most rigorous result.         Professor Hanson initially trained as an artist. She was born in 1921 in Larchmont, N.Y., where her father, Francis Coffin, was an Episcopal minister. After attending Skidmore College, she earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in painting from the University of Southern California in 1943. In 1944 and 1945, she studied at the Arts Students League in New York City. She earned a master's degree in painting from the University of North Carolina in 1951.         By the late 1950's she was recently divorced, teaching art at the University of Buffalo and supporting three small children. She returned to graduate school, earning a Ph.D. in art history from Bryn Mawr College in 1962 while also teaching there. Her dissertation on the Renaissance sculptor Jacopo della Quercia was published as a book in 1965.         Over the next several years Professor Hanson taught at Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr and New York University and was a consultant at the International Study Center of the Museum of Modern Art. In 1969 and 70 she was a visiting lecturer at Yale and later in 1970 joined the Yale faculty as full professor, the first woman to do so. At the time, only two of Yale's 363 full professorships were held by women, and they had been promoted from within their departments.         In 1971, shortly after being hired at Yale, Professor Hanson was the plaintiff in a suit to admit women on the Yale faculty to Mory's, the all-male eating club. Mory's lost its liquor license in 1972 and admitted women in 1974.         From 1974 to 1978 she was chairman of the art history department, the first woman at Yale to become a department chairman. In 1978 she was named John Hay Whitney Professor of the History of Art at Yale. She retired in 1992.         Professor Hanson served as president of the College Art Association (1972-74), was acting head of the Yale University Art Gallery (1986-87) and a Samuel H. Kress professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (1992-93).         She is survived by her companion, Bernard Hanson, whom she married in 1960 but later divorced; the children of her first marriage, a daughter, Anne Blaine Garson, of Amherst, Mass.; and two sons, James Garson, of Houston, and Robert Garson, of Pittsburgh; six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.       
         Rona Goffen, a historian of Medieval and Renaissance art, died on Sept. 8 in Princeton, N.J. She was 60 and lived in Princeton.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Lucy Fremont, a cousin.         Professor Goffen's method paid careful attention to the social and economic context surrounding artists. Professor Goffen, who had been a distinguished professor at Rutgers since 1988, was born in Brooklyn in 1944 and graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1966. She received her Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1974.         After teaching at Indiana University and Princeton University, she spent a decade at Duke University, serving as head of the art history department for three years, before moving to Rutgers.         Her books included ''Piety and Patronage in Renaissance Venice: Bellini, Titian and the Franciscans'' (Yale, 1986); ''Spirituality in Conflict: Saint Francis and Giotto's Bardi Chapel'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988); ''Titian's Women'' (Yale, 1994); and ''Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian'' (Yale, 2002). Her monograph on Giovanni Bellini (Yale, 1994) was translated into Italian.         At the time of her death, Professor Goffen was working on a book about women in the Renaissance and the Last Judgment as painted by artists from Giotto to Michelangelo.         In addition to Ms. Fremont, she is survived by her aunt, Charlotte Garrett, of Fredericksburg, Va.; and her cousins, Laura Hayford, of Burke, Va.; Adam Brook, of San Francisco; and Jonathan Brook , of Rye, N.Y.       
         Françoise Sagan, the rebellious French writer who achieved fame as a teenager with her first novel, ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' a precocious tale of sexual disillusionment, but whose international reputation dimmed as literary tastes changed, died yesterday in Honfleur, in northern France. She was 69.         The cause was a blood clot in a lung, friends of her family told Agence France-Presse. She had been in poor health for several years.         Ms. Sagan had an enormous international success with ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' about an amoral teenager who sets out to keep her philandering widowed father from marrying again. The novel was originally published in France in 1954. The following year an English translation reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Sagan was only 19, making her the youngest author to achieve that feat at the time.         By early 1958, the book had sold 810,000 copies in France and more than a million in the United States and had been translated into 20 languages.         Serge Gavronsky, a professor of French literature at Barnard College, said in a 1995 interview that Ms. Sagan's early novels expressed the rebelliousness and cynicism of many of her peers in the French bourgeoisie. Those books, he said, ''were perfectly in accord with a moment of time'' -- the mid-1950's -- and ''well connected'' with France's literary past.         John Updike, writing in The New Yorker 20 years after ''Bonjour Tristesse'' appeared, praised ''its sparkling sea and secluding woods, its animal quickness, its academically efficient plot, its heroes and heroines given the perfection of Racine personae by the young author's innocent belief in glamour.''         Later works by Ms. Sagan appeared repeatedly on best-seller lists in France, and she went on to write more than a score of books, as well as plays, film scripts, short stories and song lyrics. Some of her novels were turned into movies -- ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and ''A Certain Smile'' in 1958 -- and she directed the 1977 French film ''Les Fougères Bleues.''         ''Les Auteurs de la Littérature Française,'' a standard French work for students, described Ms. Sagan's terrain as somewhat limited: ''a worldly, rich, idle, luxurious universe; some characters who live without material cares, who drink, who love themselves without conviction. A taste for the unfinished, for biting analysis, for narcissism. Sagan has forever been recounting the rotting of a generation.''         Roger Shattuck, a cultural historian and professor of French at Boston University, said in 1995 that Ms. Sagan's reputation ''had declined considerably after her first half-dozen novels'' because she wrote too much and repeated herself and because of changing literary fashions.         Ms. Sagan's view of herself and her life was sometimes harsh. In ''Et Toute Ma Sympathie,'' a 1993 book made up largely of reflections, she included a poem in which she called herself ''this bizarre woman, childish and messed up.''         In the first flush of Ms. Sagan's fame, she became known for drinking until dawn and gambling lavishly. It has been reported that she once made a killing at the gaming tables of Deauville and then turned around and used the money to buy herself a turn-of-the-century chateau.         She also praised the joys of driving sports cars. ''Whoever has not thrilled to speed has not thrilled to life,'' she wrote in ''With Fondest Regards'' (1985). ''However madly and hopelessly in love you may be, at 120 miles an hour you are less so. Your blood no longer congeals around your heart; your blood throbs to the extremities of your body, to your fingertips, your toes and your eyelids, now the fateful and tireless guardians of your own life.''         She suffered a skull fracture and other injuries in 1957 when her Aston-Martin overturned while she was living in Milly, a resort town in northern France.         Ms. Sagan was convicted twice of narcotics offenses, in 1990 and 1995, receiving fines and prison sentences, which were suspended.         She once told an investigating magistrate: ''I believe I have a right to destroy myself as long as it does not harm anyone. If I feel like swallowing a glass of caustic soda, that's my own problem.''In 2002 she was also convicted of tax fraud in a case involving payments she received in the early 1990's to intercede with François Mitterrand, a friend and then the president of France, in an oil deal. Her health prevented her from appearing in court.         Ms. Sagan was born on June 21, 1935, in Cajarc, a village in southwest France. She was the third and youngest child of Paul Quoirez, a well-to-do businessman, and his wife, Marie.         Françoise Quoirez, nicknamed Kiki, grew up largely in Lyons and on an estate in the Vercors region in the southeast. When she was 15, her family moved to Paris. She attended convent schools before an unsuccessful academic experience at the Sorbonne.         She took the pen name Sagan because she liked the way it sounded. The name also harked back to the Prince and Princesse de Sagan, 19th-century Parisians on whom Marcel Proust is said to have based some of his characters.         After two years at the Sorbonne, with much time spent in cafes and little studying, she failed crucial year-end examinations in June 1953, angering her family. She felt she ''had to do something'' to placate them, she would recall, so she sat down and wrote ''Bonjour Tristesse'' in August. She had already been thinking about the novel and making notes for it for some months.         The book begins with what has come to be seen as a vintage Sagan sentence: ''A strange melancholy pervades me, to which I hesitate to give the grave and beautiful name of sorrow.''         In ''With Fondest Regards,'' Ms. Sagan, noting that ''Bonjour Tristesse'' enjoyed a ''succès de scandale'' when it first came out in France, said that in those days she could not understand what all the fuss was about.         Looking back three decades later, she said the furor resulted partly from the relationship between the heroine, Cécile, and her boyfriend.         ''It was inconceivable,'' she wrote, ''that a young girl of 17 or 18 should make love without being in love with a boy of her own age, and not be punished for it.''         Furthermore, she added, people couldn't accept that this girl ''should know about her father's love affairs, discuss them with him, and thereby reach a kind of complicity with him on subjects that had until then been taboo between parents and children.''         Ms. Sagan continued to weave fiction from sentences that were a bit abstract in the French way but that at their best dealt trenchantly and economically with the emotions.         Her other novels published in translation in the United States include ''A Certain Smile'' (1956), ''Those Without Shadows'' (1957), ''Aimez-Vous Brahms?'' (1960), ''Wonderful Clouds'' (1962), ''La Chamade'' (1966), ''The Heart-Keeper'' (1968), ''A Few Hours of Sunlight'' (1971), ''The Painted Lady'' (1983), ''Incidental Music'' and ''Salad Days'' (1984).         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1983, Nora Johnson praised ''the grace and freshness of her early novels, those slender tales of love between aged children and middle-aged burnouts that seemed so remarkable when they began appearing in the 50's,'' observing that Ms. Sagan ''seemed to know everything then.''         Ms. Sagan won the Prix des Critiques in 1954 for ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and the Prix de Monaco 30 years later for her work as a whole.         Her 1958 marriage to Guy Schoeller, a publisher, ended in divorce in 1960. Her 1962 marriage to Robert James Westhoff, an American ceramicist and sculptor, ended in divorce in 1963.         Her survivors include a son, Denis, from her marriage to Mr. Westhoff.         Ms. Sagan's views on romance could be somber. In a 1980 interview, she said: ''I think love is like an illness, an intoxication. Sometimes I've been intoxicated for three or four years, but never more. I think that people can be happy together for longer than I used to believe, but I still don't think it can be forever.''         In a 1993 interview before her second drug trial, Ms. Sagan recalled: ''I had incredible luck because just when I grew up, the pill came along. When I was 18, I used to die with fear of being pregnant, but then it arrived, and love was free and without consequence for nearly 30 years. Then AIDS came. Those 30 years coincided with my adulthood, the age for having fun.''       
         Dr. Katharina Dalton, a British gynecologist who did early work establishing a link between fluctuations in the menstrual cycle and changes in behavior and who advocated using progesterone to treat premenstrual syndrome, died on Sept. 17 in Britain, The Associated Press reported. She was 87.         Beginning in the early 1950's, Dr. Dalton led pioneering studies of premenstrual syndrome, challenging the widely accepted view that the condition was a figment of the imagination. She led one of the first clinics to specifically treat the symptoms, at University College Hospital in London.         She is largely credited with developing the use of menstrual charts for the diagnosis of the disorder, and argued that the timing of PMS in women was associated with higher rates of suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and violent crimes.         ''Many people did not believe it was a real entity,'' said Dr. Mona Shangold, a former assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ''She really brought it into the public eye, and eventually it became an accepted disorder for which we now have good treatments.''         PMS, Dr. Dalton argued, was brought on primarily by deficiencies of progesterone and could be alleviated with hormone therapy. She also believed that the hormone could be used to ease postnatal depression. But today most experts disagree with those findings and instead rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, and other medications for the treatment of PMS.         ''None of the rest of us have found progesterone as helpful as the data Dr. Dalton presented, but she really was quite influential in the modern understanding of what happens to women premenstrually,'' said Dr. Diana Dell, an OB-GYN and psychiatrist at the Duke University Medical Center.         Born in 1916 in London, Katharina Kuipers Dalton began her career as a podiatrist after studying at the London Foot Hospital. After her first husband died during World War II, she decided to switch careers and earned a medical degree at the Royal Free Hospital.         In later work, Dr. Dalton helped demonstrate that depression and other disorders could be aggravated by PMS, particularly around the last few days of the menstrual cycle or the first days of menstruation. While many experts today agree that PMS can exacerbate certain conditions and influence behavior, some of Dr. Dalton's assertions remain controversial. In several court cases in the 1980's, for example, she testified in defense of women who blamed severe PMS for their criminal offenses.         Several of Dr. Dalton's books, including ''Once a Month,'' published in the late 70's, became best sellers.         Dr. Dalton is survived by four children and five grandchildren, according to The Independent, a British daily.       
         Virginia Hamilton Adair, a California poet who published her first collection, ''Ants on the Melon,'' when she was 83, died on Thursday in Claremont, Calif., her daughter, Katharine Adair Waugh, said. She was 91 and lived in Claremont.         Published by Random House in 1996, ''Ants on the Melon'' received wide attention, partly because of Ms. Adair's personal story (a retired English professor, by then blind from glaucoma, she had written poetry all her life but had published little since the 1940's) and partly for the unaffected style and universal themes of her work.         The collection sold more than 28,000 copies, which her editor, Daniel Menaker, yesterday called an ''alpine'' figure for a volume of poetry.         Reviewing ''Ants on the Melon'' in The New York Times Book Review, Brad Leithauser wrote, ''Given how much darkness the book contains -- meditations on the atom bomb, her husband's death, a drowned girl, the literal dark of blindness -- it casts a surprisingly bright afterglow.''         In the poem ''Break-In,'' Ms. Adair wrote:         Hearing the footsteps of thieves         in the dark downstairs:         what are you looking for?         it has already been stolen         over and over. . . .         Mary Virginia Hamilton was born in the Bronx on Feb. 28, 1913, and was raised in Montclair, N.J. She disliked the name Mary and dropped it as soon as she left home. She grew up surrounded by poetry. Her father, Robert Browning Hamilton, was a serious amateur poet, and one of her earliest memories was of him reading Alexander Pope's ''Iliad'' to her in her crib. She began writing her own poems when she was 6.         Ms. Adair held a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke College and a master's from Radcliffe and was a professor at California Polytechnic University in Pomona for many years. In 1936, she married Douglass Adair, who became a prominent historian. Mr. Adair committed suicide in 1968.         In the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Adair published poems in The Saturday Review, The Atlantic and The New Republic. Though she continued to write almost daily, the demands of motherhood, and later of an academic career, plus her distaste for the gamesmanship of the publishing world, caused her to send out little work for the next half-century.         In the late 1980's, a friend, the poet Robert Mezey, encouraged Ms. Adair to put together a manuscript of her best work. Some years later, without her knowledge, he sent a copy to Alice Quinn, the New Yorker's poetry editor. Ms. Quinn published several of the poems, along with a rapturous essay on Ms. Adair, in the magazine's 1995 year-end double issue. After that, Ms. Adair's work appeared regularly in The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books. Though some critics were cautious (Jonathan Galassi called her ''a serious poet without being an earth-shatteringly original one''), others praised it lavishly. The poet Galway Kinnell told The New Yorker, ''She has arrived in our world like a comet.''         In addition to her daughter, of New Paltz, N.Y., Ms. Adair is survived by two sons, Robert, of Pomona, and Douglass, of Thermal, Calif.; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Betty Hill, whose assertion that she was carried off by otherworldly beings in 1961 inspired a national obsession with alien abduction that remains a staple of American popular culture, died on Sunday at her home in Portsmouth, N.H. She was 85.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Kathleen Marden said.         Mrs. Hill was not the first person to tell of an alien encounter. But her account was the first to capture the public imagination on a grand scale, defining a narrative subgenre that has flourished in the decades since.         Mrs. Hill's account was the subject of a book by John G. Fuller, ''The Interrupted Journey: Two Lost Hours 'Aboard a Flying Saucer''' (Dial, 1966). In 1975 it became a television movie, ''The UFO Incident.'' The film starred Estelle Parsons as Mrs. Hill and James Earl Jones as her husband, Barney, who also said he was abducted.         The incident, the Hills said, occurred on the night of Sept. 19, 1961. Driving in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, they saw a light that seemed to grow larger and larger. Back home, they found what appeared to be shiny spots on the car's exterior. They could not account for a two-hour segment of their trip.         The Hills later saw a psychiatrist, who put them under hypnosis. Gradually, a narrative of the couple's lost hours emerged. They recounted many times that a group of short gray-skinned beings stopped their car and took them aboard a waiting spaceship. There, the Hills said, they were subjected to rigorous medical examinations that included inserting a long needle into Mrs. Hill's navel.         The account fit squarely in the Western narrative tradition. With a dark night, ghostly apparitions and sexual undercurrent, it had many Victorian gothic hallmarks, and it shared the common Western folklore theme of being spirited off and ravished by an otherworldly creature.         In the Hills' account, these traditional elements were transplanted to a modern but no less anxious time, the height of the cold war, when many people gazed nervously skyward.         ''It's not unlike the Leda and the swan myth,'' said Terry Matheson, a professor of English at the University of Saskatchewan and the author of ''Alien Abductions: Creating a Modern Phenomenon'' (Prometheus, 1998). ''The alien comes in, probes women in a distinctly sexual way for purposes that are equally inscrutable, but which may, we're told, make sense down the road.''         Mrs. Hill was born Eunice Elizabeth Barrett on June 28, 1919, in Newton, N.H. A graduate of the University of New Hampshire, she was a social worker for many years. Besides her niece, survivors include three sisters, two children and three grandchildren. Mr. Hill died in 1969.         The Hills' cultural legacy includes films (''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''), television programs (''Roswell'') and books, like those by Whitley Strieber and John Mack, that treat alien abduction as a plausible phenomenon.       
         Carol H. Pitchersky, a former associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union who helped it overcome a potentially bankrupting deficit, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 57.         The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Morton H. Halperin, said.         Ms. Pitchersky, who worked for the A.C.L.U. from 1979 to 1988, joined the organization at a low point in its fiscal history. Subsisting primarily on membership dues, the A.C.L.U. had made little sustained effort to raise larger donations. By the mid-1970's, its finances were precarious, said Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and the author of ''In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU.''         The crisis came in 1977, with the organization's defense of the American Nazi Party's right to march in Skokie, Ill. Thousands of members resigned in outrage, and donations declined sharply. By 1978, according to Dr. Walker's book, the A.C.L.U. was almost $500,000 in debt.         As the head of development and strategic planning, Ms. Pitchersky was responsible for revitalizing the organization's fund-raising programs.         According to Dr. Walker's book, ''Contributions rose from less than $300,000 in 1977 to over $3 million in 1988.'' Carol Helen Pitchersky was born on Oct. 3, 1947, in Brooklyn, and received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College. After a marriage that ended in divorce, she married Mr. Halperin in 1991.         After leaving the A.C.L.U., Ms. Pitchersky worked as a private consultant, advising nonprofit organizations on fund-raising. She was involved most recently with America Coming Together, an advocacy group allied with the Democratic Party, her husband said.         Besides Mr. Halperin, the director of policy planning at the State Department under President Bill Clinton, Ms. Pitchersky is survived by her father, Arthur, of Rockville, Md.; and by two half sisters, Karen Williams of Poolesville, Md.; and Laura Crisp of Herndon, Va.       
         Yang Huanyi, the last woman to communicate secretly with others in a rare script used exclusively by women, died Sept. 20 in her home in Hunan Province, China. She was believed to be in her late 90's.         The New China News Agency reported her death, saying estimates of her age ranged from 95 to 98.         The script, Nushu, represents the language spoken in Jiangyong Prefecture in the rolling hills of southern Hunan Province. Women, who were denied education for many centuries in China, used it to share feminine feelings, including fears about arranged marriages, husbands and, of course, mothers-in-law.         ''By writing, so much suffering disappears,'' Ms. Yang said in an interview with Northwest Asian Weekly in 1996.         The news agency called Ms. Yang the ''last practitioner'' of Nushu.         However, Orie Endo, a language professor at Bunkyo University in Tokyo and a leading scholar of the writing system, said in an e-mail message that at least two other women knew and still used some Nushu. She said Ms. Yang was important because she was the last woman to use Nushu to communicate with other women under an oath of secrecy, the ancient way.         One of the women she said was conversant with the script is He Yanxin, who learned it from her grandmother. The other, He Jinhua, who like He Yanxin is in her 60's, began to teach herself to write Nushu in 1997.         Laura Miller, a professor of linguistic anthropology at Loyola University in Chicago, said in an e-mail message that she had heard reports that other anthropologists working in China had found other women who continued to use Nushu.         But its disappearance may be inevitable. In 2002, Time magazine included Nushu in the 50 percent of the world's 6,000 languages that might be extinct by 2050. An academic record is being preserved by scholars, some of them men. Also, the Chinese government supports the collection and study of Nushu script, partly to encourage tourism in the small part of Hunan Province where it was historically used. Nushu, which means ''female writing,'' contains at least 1,800 characters, each representing a spoken syllable, not an idea, as is the case for much of Chinese calligraphy, which has at least 50,000 characters. A script specific to one sex is rare among the world's languages, and popular writers have called Nushu ''the witch's script'' and the ''first language of women's liberation.''         Men once used the script but lost interest, not least because they were educated in Mandarin, Dr. Miller wrote in February on a Web site, keywords.oxus.net.         Women were not educated, and gathered at homes to make shoes or embroider. Though in early Chinese history, the penalty for creating languages was death, women quietly developed a code for their secret sorority.         ''What started as a simple way to express themselves became a chronicle of their private anguish,'' Zhao Liming, a Nushu specialist at Qinghua University in Beijing, said in an interview with The South China Post.         Men, who always understood spoken Nushu, derided the written form as ''ant characters'' or ''mosquito scrawls,'' the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in June. Professor Zhao said the belief was that ''anything to do with women was inferior, insignificant.''         A principal function of the script was for communication among women who called themselves ''sworn sisters.'' Writing in verse on handkerchiefs, fans and elsewhere, they often used Nushu's vocabulary of more than 20,000 words to communicate about marriage as a tragic event. Hardbound booklets conveying deep anxieties about marriage were common wedding gifts in the region.         Chinese scholars began studying Nushu in the mid-1950's, but the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 prohibited its use as a leftover of feudalism. In the early 1980's, academics rediscovered it and the dozen old women who still used it. Yang Huanyi was born in a village in Hunan in 1909, Dr. Endo and at least one other source said. At 10, she began learning Nushu from a woman whose feet had been bound in the traditional fashion and could not find work. In the lessons, the teacher wrote a strip of characters, as Ms. Yang watched. The woman sang as she wrote, and Ms. Yang sang the same songs when she studied by herself.         Once Ms. Yang mastered Nushu, she, too, wrote for others, but charged only for marriage booklets. She married, but her husband died two years later after he was bitten by a snake. She then married a gambler who ran up big debts. They had eight children before he died.         Her family responsibilities and the deaths of her sworn sisters ended Ms. Yang's writing until 1990, when a scholar urged her to resume.         Ms. Yang is survived by two sons and a daughter, The South China Morning Post reported.       
         Dr. M. Irené Ferrer, a New York cardiologist and medical educator who helped refine the cardiac catheter and electrocardiogram, which have become diagnostic essentials in heart treatment, died at her apartment in Manhattan last Friday. She was 89.         The cause was pneumonia combined with congestive heart failure, said a close friend, Dr. Marianne J. Legato, a Columbia cardiologist and internist, who was a protégée of Dr. Ferrer as a medical student in the 1950's.         Dr. Ferrer, who spent four decades at Columbia University, grew up as a New York society debutante, blossoming into an internationally recognized researcher and clinician.         Working at Bellevue Hospital in New York in the 1940's, she contributed to laboratory research that led to the cardiac catheter, a flexible tube passed through a patient's veins and directly into the heart or coronary arteries.         The catheter permits precise measurement of blood pressure and flow and has led to angioplasty and other revolutionary heart treatments. In 1956 its development was recognized with the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, shared by a German scientist, Dr. Werner Forssmann and two researchers from Columbia, André F. Cournand and Dr. Dickinson W. Richards. Dr. Richards noted Dr. Ferrer's studies in his Nobel lecture.         In later work Dr. Ferrer turned to the electrocardiogram, commonly known as an EKG, the electrical record of the heart's beating. She helped devise a computer-assisted algorithm that allowed a clearer and more immediate reading of that record. Previously, the test, which is often used to assess damages after a heart attack, could be interpreted only by doctors with specific training.         Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt, chairman of the department of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said that Dr. Ferrer was ''a leader in electrocardiography at a time when it was the only test we had to judge the heart.'' He added, ''She taught today's teachers.''         Marie Irené Ferrer was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan and Bryn Mawr College before earning her medical degree at Columbia in 1941.         She practiced briefly at New York University, then returned to Columbia in 1946 and was named an assistant professor there five years later. Dr. Ferrer was appointed professor of clinical medicine in 1972 and became a professor emeritus in 1981. She continued in private practice until nine years ago.         Dr. Ferrer was a former editor in chief of Current Cardiology and The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. In 1993 she received a gold medal from Columbia Medical School's alumni association.         Dr. Ferrer is survived by a brother, Mel Ferrer, the actor and director, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
         Nancy Larrick, an educator whose poetry anthologies and widely used parent's guide helped introduce generations of children not only to reading, but also to literature, died on Nov. 14 in Winchester, Va. She was 93 and lived in Winchester.         The cause was pneumonia, said her stepson, Alexander C. Crosby.         Dr. Larrick considered the standard reading workbooks of the 1950's, with their picture games and stories about Dick and Jane, insulting to even a 5-year-old's intelligence. An editor of children's books for Random House, she preferred Dr. Seuss and Little Bear and asserted in a book review in The New York Times that children ''can hear the rhythm of beautifully turned phrases and follow the suspense of a good story line.''         In the poetry anthologies she edited, she included verses by the likes of Emily Dickinson, William Carlos Williams and Yuan Mei.         In a 1965 Saturday Review of Literature article, ''The All-White World of Children's Books,'' she criticized the near absence of black characters in children's books. Her criticism pushed publishers to evaluate their policies and led to several follow-up studies.         Dr. Larrick was a founder and president of the International Reading Association, a literacy group that today has 80,000 members in about 100 countries, and would invite teenagers and children to its annual conferences to give teachers pointers on what they enjoyed reading, though she never indulged their taste for comic books.         Her most popular work, ''A Parent's Guide to Children's Reading,'' was published in 1958 and reprinted six times.         Sequels included ''Your Child and His Reading: How Parents Can Help'' (1960), ''A Teacher's Guide to Children's Books'' (1963) and nine other books for adults. She wrote or edited almost 30 books for children, including at least 14 poetry anthologies.         Nancy Larrick Crosby, who used her maiden name professionally, was born Dec. 28, 1910, in Winchester. She graduated from Goucher College when she was 19 and became an English teacher like her mother, also named Nancy Larrick. She received a master's degree in education from Columbia in 1936 and a doctorate in education from New York University in 1955.         She was an adjunct professor at Lehigh University from 1964 to 1979 and later taught at N.Y.U. and Indiana University. She wrote dozens of articles for education journals.         Her husband, Alexander L. Crosby, died in 1980. In addition to her stepson, Alexander from Carmel, Calif; she is survived by three granddaughters and four great-grandchildren.       
         Frederica de Laguna, an anthropologist whose work on the history and culture of little-known Arctic civilizations was groundbreaking in the most literal sense of the word, died on Oct. 6 at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 98.         Her death was announced by Bryn Mawr College, where Dr. de Laguna was the William R. Kenan Jr. professor emeritus of anthropology. She founded the college's anthropology department and taught there from 1938 until her retirement in 1975.         An authority on Alaskan prehistory, Dr. de Laguna was part of the first generation of women to succeed in the rough-and-ready, ultramasculine world of early 20th century field archaeology. She traveled thousands of miles by steamship and skiff, leading expeditions to villages so remote they appeared on no map. There, she contended with -- and generally got the better of -- bitter cold, frozen ground, ravenous mosquitoes and the rare male colleague foolhardy enough to question her ability.         ''I love the actual digging, the rhythmical swing of the arms and the bending and pushing with the whole body,'' Dr. de Laguna wrote in ''Voyage to Greenland'' (1977), a memoir of her first field trip, made when she was 22. ''The sun shines warmly over my back, the rich, sweet smell of rotted blubber rises from the saturated earth.''         In 1975, Dr. de Laguna and Margaret Mead were the first female anthropologists elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Among her best-known books are ''The Archaeology of Cook Inlet'' (1934), ''The Prehistory of Northern North America as Seen From the Yukon'' (1947), ''Chugach Prehistory: The Archeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska'' (1956) and her three-volume masterwork, ''Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit'' (1972). She was the subject of a 1997 documentary film, ''Reunion Under Mount Saint Elias.''         When Dr. de Laguna made her first trip to Alaska, in 1930, Arctic culture was virtually unknown. Victorian explorers had brought back trunkfuls of artifacts, but no scholar before her had studied an Arctic community in depth.         ''She was really trying to find any possible kind of evidence that could converge to give us the overall history of these peoples,'' said Regna Darnell, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario and a former student of Dr. de Laguna's. ''Those early papers are a database that people have worked with ever since.''         Frederica Annis Lopez de Leo de Laguna, almost always called Freddy, was born on Oct. 3, 1906, in Ann Arbor, Mich. She grew up in Bryn Mawr, where her parents taught philosophy. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Bryn Mawr in 1927 and, in 1933, a doctorate in anthropology from Columbia, where she was one of the last students of the anthropologist Franz Boas.         In 1929, while still a graduate student, she joined a Danish expedition to a tiny island on Greenland's west coast. She planned to stay six weeks. She stayed nearly six months.         ''How could I realize the hold which this experience -- the free life, the happy, fascinating natives, the absorbing work and the loyal comradeship -- has obtained over me,'' she wrote in a letter home at the end of the trip. ''I feel as if I could never be content with ordinary living again, unless it were to be broken by a return to the Arctic. It makes me very sad to know that I have found my ideal vocation in such an inaccessible place.''         She was so sure of her vocation, and its incompatibility with married life, that she broke her engagement to a young mining engineer. She never married, and left no immediate survivors.         A Wave in World War II, Dr. de Laguna also studied the Pima Indians of Arizona. She wrote two mystery novels with anthropological settings, ''The Arrow Points to Murder'' (1937) and ''Fog on the Mountain'' (1938).         While Dr. de Laguna's work drew praise from many of the Alaskan Natives whose traditions she explored, she had limited patience with the sensitivities of the multicultural era. In recent years, she was called upon to defend her practice -- routine among anthropologists of her generation -- of opening the graves of indigenous people and removing their contents for study.         With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, many of these remains, which had been in museums for decades, were returned for reburial. Dr. de Laguna regretted the loss to scholarship in no uncertain terms.         ''Some of our ancestors went to the stake for the right to do science,'' she told The Baltimore Sun in 1997. ''Now we have to kowtow to the superstition of these Indians.''       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Mona Van Duyn, a poet laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner who spoke with a distinctly female voice from suburbia, died on Thursday at her home in suburban St. Louis. She was 83.         Her death was announced by Alfred A. Knopf, which published her ''Selected Poems'' two years ago. Her first book in nine years, it includes nearly half of the poems published in her previous eight volumes, starting with ''Valentines to the Wide World'' in 1959.         Knopf said Ms. Van Duyn (pronounced dine) had recently been found to have bone cancer.         To readers unfamiliar with her work, ''Selected Poems'' presented a generous and judicious sampling of a long and successful career, Brian Henry wrote in The New York Times Book Review.         ''Characterized by candor and compassion,'' he said, ''Van Duyn's poetry depicts the pleasures and drudgeries of middle-class American life, an approach that at its best becomes an exploration of the spiritual and psychological dimensions of that life.         ''A pioneer of the poetry of the suburbs -- now a common mode in which the ordinary is routinely revealed as extraordinary -- Van Duyn also knows that the ordinary is frequently just that.''         Mr. Henry, editor of the magazine Verse and director of the creative writing program at the University of Georgia, mentioned the rare incendiary moments in her work but added that, ''Her poetry is primarily, and literally, civil, seeking to uphold the accepted foundations of civilization -- marriage and friendship, love and sympathy -- while occasionally plumbing those foundations for cracks.''         Mr. Henry wrote that he considered Ms. Van Duyn's first three books to be her best, especially ''To See, To Take,'' her second, which won the National Book Award for Poetry in 1971. In it she interwove religious and mythological themes, like divine and human love and the violence of love, with less exalted topics.         In one poem, for example, she compared her work to home canning, writing:         Oh, I know, I know that, great or humble, the arts         in their helplessness can save but a few selves         by such disguises from Time's hideous bite,         and yet, a sweating Proust of the pantry shelves,         I cupboard these pickled peaches in Time's despite.         Ms. Van Duyn was selected by the Library of Congress in 1992 to serve a term as the United States poet laureate. She was the sixth laureate and the first woman to be chosen.         When notified by James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress at the time, Ms. Van Duyn said it was clear to her that the selectors who made the choice were ''getting very nervous'' about the absence of a woman as laureate.         Before the position was formally established by Congress in 1985, it had a forerunner in the library's poetry consultant. There were about two dozen of them, but only a handful were women.         A year before becoming poet laureate, Ms. Van Duyn won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The award cited her for ''Near Changes'' (Knopf, 1990). She also received, among many others, the Bollingen Prize in 1970; the Carl Sandburg Prize of Cornell College in 1982; the Hart Crane Memorial Award in 1968; the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize in 1989; the Shelley Memorial Prize of the Poetry Society of America in 1987; and a Guggenheim fellowship in 1972. She was also a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Mona Jane Van Duyn was born on May 9, 1921, in Waterloo, Iowa, and graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 1942, when it was the Iowa State Teachers College. She received a master's degree from the University of Iowa the next near and taught English there until 1946. In 1943 she married Jarvis A. Thurston, whom she met in a writing class and who became a professor of English; he survives her.         She also had an academic career, teaching at the University of Louisville, in Kentucky, and at Washington University in St. Louis, as well as at writing seminars and conferences.         Between ''Valentines'' and ''Selected Poems,'' she also published, among others, ''A Time of Bees'' (1964); ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (1982); ''If It Be Not I: Collected Poems 1959-1982'' (1992), which included much of her earlier work; and ''Firefall'' (1992), which remains in print at Knopf.         ''I don't know why that is,'' she said 14 years ago as the newly chosen laureate, musing about why women were not anthologized or consulted as frequently as men. ''Perhaps it is because younger women are able to teach, or take the time to raise children. Even for older women, one's life is complicated. It is difficult to be called by a reporter or the Library of Congress when one is cooking a complicated recipe.''         Or, as she once put it in another context:         The world is perverse,         but it could be worse.         (''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems.'')         Correction:  December 23, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the poet Mona Van Duyn on Dec. 4 misstated the first line of a couplet from her poem ''Sonnet for Minimalists'' and misidentified the first book in which it appeared. The couplet reads, ''The world's perverse/but it could be worse' -- not ''The world is perverse.'' The sonnet was first published in book form in ''Near Changes'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1990), not in ''Letters From a Father, and Other Poems'' (Atheneum, 1982).
