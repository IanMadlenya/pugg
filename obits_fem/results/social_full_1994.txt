         Anne Joers Firestone, a philanthropist and civic leader in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died at her home there on Dec. 28. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said Bob Troyer, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Firestone was born in New York and graduated from Miss Porter's School. She had lived in Bryn Mawr since the late 1940's and was active in many civic and social organizations. She served with the Red Cross in World War II.         She was the widow of Roger S. Firestone, an industrialist who was the fifth son of Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Roger Firestone died in 1970 at 57.         Mrs. Firestone is survived by a son, John D., of Washington; three daughters, Gay F. Wray and Susan F. Semegen of Paradise Valley, Ariz., and Cinda F. Fox of New York; a brother, Peter Joers of Hot Springs, Ark., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Rebecca Pollard Van Lennep Guggenheim Logan, a philanthropist and patron of the arts who was for a generation one of the best-known social hostesses in Washington, died on Friday at her home in Washington. She was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Leonard L. Silverstein, her lawyer.         For 21 years she was married to Col. M. Robert Guggenheim, an heir to a copper fortune, who died in 1959. Their 55-room residence, Firenze House, is one of Washington's great estates, set on 22 acres in the northwestern section of the city.         From the 1940's to the 1970's Firenze House was the setting for social functions attended by Presidents, Government officials, diplomats and business executives. It was also used for charity fund-raising events.         Mrs. Logan was active in committees aiding the National Society of Arts and Letters, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the National Symphony and the Opera Society of Washington.         She studied art in New York and graduated from the school at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. While there, she met and in 1926 married a Harvard student, Dr. William B. Van Lennep Jr. They divorced in 1937.         The next year she married Colonel Guggenheim , who was United States Ambassador to Portugal in 1953 and 1954, aboard his 175-foot yacht.         After Colonel Guggenheim died, she married John A. Logan in 1962. Mr. Logan, a management consultant in Washington, died in 1986.         She is survived by a son, Richard Van Lennep of Washington; a nephew, Randolph M. Pollard of Las Vegas, Nev., and a niece, Beverly Page of Bow, N.H.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Sylvia L. Milberg, associate director of development for Pace University in New York, died on Tuesday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. Mrs. Milberg, who lived in Westport, Conn., was 66.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Stanley Milberg.         Mrs. Milberg had been at Pace since 1983. Before that she was director of grants at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. She was a graduate of Antioch College. Also active in civic affairs, Mrs. Milberg was a founder and the first chairwoman of the Westport Historic District Commission.         She is survived by her husband and four sons, Daniel of Northampton, Mass., David of Charleston, Ill., William of New York and John of Seattle.       
         Dr. Hanna Grunwald, a retired group psychotherapist and former director of Amnesty International U.S.A. in New York, died on May 15 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in Fairfield, Conn. She was 94 and had lived in Washington Heights until the late 1970's.         She had a long illness, Amnesty International said.         A native of Berlin, she received a doctorate at the University of Frankfurt and joined a resistance group shortly after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. She and her husband, Marcus, managed to flee to France, where she played a role in helping thousands of homeless refugee children.         French authorities deported the couple, who then were interned in Casablanca, spent a harsh 22 months in the Dominican Republic and finally arrived in New York with their young son in 1944. Dr. Grunwald worked as a file clerk but was able to obtain a master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work with the help of her employer. 2d Career at Amnesty Group         She spent many years helping troubled youths through the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service and other social-work agencies in the city. In the 1960's, she began to devote her evenings to volunteer work for Amnesty International.         She retired from her professional career in 1971 to join Amnesty and its board of directors, and led a group of local volunteers. She was named an honorary chairwoman of the organization in 1978, and later remained active at board meetings and in refugee committees.         Dr. Grunwald is survived by her son, George, of Benecia, Calif., and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1949 after a long illness contracted in a concentration camp in Germany.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Rita Webb Smith, a community advocate whose work to rid a neighborhood of drug trafficking gained her national attention, died last Saturday at her home in Harlem. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A lifelong resident of West 143d Street, Mrs. Smith was a social worker and counselor for many years at Harlem Hospital, the Children's Aid Society and, most recently, the Visiting Nurse Service.         Starting with the organization of a preservation group for her street, she helped the police in her precinct to clear a drug-infested neighborhood. Her preservation group was largely credited with the restoration of a 10-block area in Harlem between 138th and 144th Streets.         Her efforts received the attention of national television shows and she recounted her experiences in a book written with Tony Chapelle, "The Woman Who Took Back Her Street" (New Horizon, 1990). It describes her life and her efforts to keep drug dealers and addicts from dominating her surroundings. Making a Difference         Mrs. Smith founded her own agency, the Family Systems for Living Center, to provide individual counseling, classes, referrals and other social services. She also started M.A.N.A. -- Make A Neighborhood Again -- to keep up the restored area; and Project Living With AIDS, which provides counseling for AIDS patients.         Mrs. Smith graduated from Fordham University College at Lincoln Center and Fordham's Graduate School of Social Service. The university made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1984 for showing that "even one citizen can make a difference." Her work also drew praise from Mayor Koch and President Reagan.         She is survived by seven daughters and sons: Judy, David, Gladys, Peter, Abena and Ayana, all of Harlem, and Mark, a resident of Spring Valley, N.Y. Also surviving is a sister, Pearl Edwards, of St. John's, Antigua.       
         Phyllis J. Shorenstein, a founder of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, died on Wednesday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Shorenstein had a heart ailment and died after a long illness, doctors said.         The wife of Walter Shorenstein, a national real estate developer, Mrs. Shorenstein was also a substantial contributor to local charities and universities.         Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco, in a tribute, said that Mrs. Shorenstein and her husband had contributed much to the city's cultural, social and civic life and had "consistently helped make this city a better place for all of us."         Art, particularly Asian art, was an enduring interest in Mrs. Shorenstein's life. She joined with other San Franciscans to create the Asian Art Museum, which opened in Golden Gate Park in 1966. She served as a board member for many years and was one of the museum's 27 commissioners at her death. Gallery Named for Family         She last visited the museum in May, when it opened an exhibition and named one of its four galleries of Japanese art in honor of the Shorenstein family. Although she was particularly devoted to Japanese and Chinese art, her tastes also extended to Western works. Her personal collection included both European and American art.         Mrs. Shorenstein made frequent visits abroad in search of additions to the museum's collection, accompanied by Rand Castile, the museum's director. "She began at the Asian Art Museum at its beginning, and she was with us every step of the way," Mr. Castile said yesterday. In the last 20 years, the Shorenstein family has donated works from China, Japan, India, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey.         With her family, Mrs. Shorenstein established the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. The center was named in honor of her daughter, a journalist and radio news producer who died of cancer in 1986.         Mrs. Shorenstein was born Phyllis Finley in Wellington, Kan., and attended Lone Mountain College in San Francisco.         She was a volunteer ambulance driver at Travis Air Force Base when she met Walter Shorenstein, who was stationed there during World War II.         Mr. Shorenstein became a leading commercial real estate developer and a prominent contributor to Democratic Party causes. She was not active in politics, but the Shorensteins frequently entertained political dignitaries, including Presidents Johnson, Carter and Clinton.         She is survived by her husband of 49 years; two children, Carole Shorenstein-Hays and Douglas Shorenstein, both of San Francisco, and six grandchildren.       
         Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.         One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.         Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979). Role in War on Poverty         She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.         A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.         Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.         She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .       
         Dr. Florence Shishko Schwartz, a retired professor of social work at the Hunter College School of Social Work, died on Wednesday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. She was 73 and had homes in Greenport, N.Y., and Greenwich.         The cause was complications from cardiac arrest two weeks after heart surgery, said her daughter, Deborah Schwartz Rapaport.         Dr. Schwartz was on her school's faculty for 33 years, rising from instructor to full professor and retiring in 1991.         She was instrumental in having the subject of voluntarism added to the school's curriculum and was an editor of The Journal of Volunteer Administration. She was also active in student exchanges with Puerto Rico and in other cross-cultural activities. She was a longtime member of the boards of the Jewish Family Services of Greenwich and the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association.         Dr. Schwartz was born in New York, grew up mainly in the Astoria section of Queens and graduated from Julia Richman High School in Manhattan. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College and master's and doctoral degrees from the Columbia School of Social Work.         During World War II, she was a Red Cross social worker at Army hospitals in Virginia and Massachusetts.         In addition to her daughter Deborah of Scarsdale, N.Y., Dr. Schwartz is survived by her husband, Dr. Martin F. Schwartz, a professor at Rockland Community College; another daughter, Nomi Schwartz Freed of Armonk, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Catherine Damon Christy, a former president of the Young Women's Christian Association of Brooklyn and a former member of the boards of various charitable organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 96 and formerly lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was cardiac arrest. She had been suffering from arteriosclerotic heart disease, said Joseph Pagliaro of the Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, Conn.         Mrs. Christy did volunteer work for years with the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. and was its president from 1944 to 1953. She was also a longtime member of its board.         In addition, she was a member of the national Y.W.C.A. board from 1947 to 1967 and was variously a member of its executive committee, its committee on racial inclusiveness and other panels.         Mrs. Christy also served on the boards of the Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service, and was secretary of the National United Service Organization from 1957 to 1968.         A native of Pulaski, Va., she received a Bachelor of Science degree from Simmons College in Boston in 1920 and was later employed as a librarian.         She married Francis T. Christy, a lawyer, in 1922. He died in 1979.         She is survived by two sons, Arthur H. of Manhattan and Dr. Francis T. Christy of Washington; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Zelma Watson George, a sociologist, musicologist and performer who broke a color barrier on Broadway in 1950, died on Sunday at University Hospitals in Cleveland. A resident of Cleveland, she was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Raoul Abdul, a New York writer and longtime friend.         Dr. George was a sought-after lecturer, a trained soprano and a leading researcher of African-American music. Her encounter with Broadway was brought about by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti for the 1950 production of "The Medium," a folk opera, at the Arena stage of the Hotel Edison.         Dr. George had sung the opera's leading role of Madame Flora, a fraudulent spiritualist, at the dedication of the Karamu Lyric Theater in Cleveland the year before. 'Power and Imagination'         That production was a black version of the 1946 Menotti work. Learning of her performance, the composer brought her to New York to sing the part in a white production. She was the first black woman to take a white role on Broadway.         "She has great personal force," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. "She sings with power and imagination."         In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her as the only black member of the United States delegation to the 15th General Assembly of the United Nations. In the late 1960's, she was the executive director of the oldest Job Corps center in the United States, in Cleveland. The State Department once sent her on a six-month lecture tour around the world.         Dr. George was born in Hearne, Tex., and graduated from the University of Chicago. She studied voice at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and pipe organ at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. She briefly worked as a social worker in Evanston and spent seven years as a probation officer in Chicago.         From 1932 to 1937, she was the dean of women at Tennessee State University in Nashville. She then helped to organize the Avalon Community Center in Los Angeles and served as its executive director until she was named a Rockefeller Foundation research fellow in 1942. Studying Black Music         Starting early in her career, Dr. George lectured on the cultural contributions of blacks. In 1935 she began her research on black music and started a lecture series on human relations.         She returned to school to earn master's and doctoral degrees in sociology at New York University. Her Rockefeller grant enabled her to travel the country and cull data from libraries, private collections, cellars and attics. She spent six months in the Library of Congress alone.         The result was her doctoral thesis, "A Guide to Negro Music: An annotated bibliography of Negro folk music and art music by Negro composers or based on Negro thematic material." It was a compendium of 12,163 titles; she donated the manuscript to Howard University.         Dr. George sat on policy-making boards of the Girl Scouts of America, the American Red Cross, the League of Women Voters and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, among others.         She was married to Clayborne George, a lawyer in Cleveland and a prominent Republican there. He died many years ago.         Dr. George is survived by two sisters, A. Catherine Johnson of Massachusetts, and Vivian Edwards of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel E. J. Watson of Bangor, Mich.       
         Mary Anna Meyer, who took part in civic affairs and charitable causes for many years, died on Sunday in North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 74 and a Glen Cove resident.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Meyer, a native of Providence, R.I., was a trustee emeritus of Connecticut College in New London, her alma mater. She served Govs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Malcolm Wilson as a member of the New York State Board of Social Welfare.         Over the years, she was also on the boards of the Nassau County Youth Board; the New York State Association for Community Services; the New York State Communities Aid Association; Center for Parents and Children, and WLIW/Channel 21. She was a past president of the Junior League of Long Island; the Family Service Association of Nassau County; the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, and United Way of Long Island.         Mrs. Meyer is survived by her husband, Richard W. Meyer, a retired vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company; a daughter, Charlotte Meyer-Arnold of Los Angeles; two sons, Richard W. Jr. and Douglas C., both of Locust Valley, L.I.; a brother, Richard C. Lemon of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on Sunday at her summer home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 78.         Dr. Coser, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of kidney failure, her family said.         She taught at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987, after which she moved to Cambridge. At her death she was an adjunct professor of sociology at Boston College, specializing in the family and medical sociology.         She was born in Berlin and reared in Belgium; she came to the United States in 1939. She started studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research but switched to sociology at Columbia University, where she earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert K. Merton. Taught Sociology at Harvard         Dr. Coser began her teaching career as an instructor at Wellesley College. In 1959 she began teaching at the Harvard University Medical School as an assistant professor of sociology in the department of psychiatry, and later became an associate professor. She also taught at Northeastern University in Boston.         She was the author of "Life in the Ward" (1962) and was involved as a contributor to or editor of "Sociological Studies of Health and Sickness" (1960), "Studies in the Hospital" (1963) and "The Family, Its Structure and Functions" (revised in 1974).         Her recent writing includes "Training in Ambiguity: Learning Through Doing in a Mental Hospital" (1979), "In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy" (1991) and "Laughter Among Colleagues" (1993). All three books remain in print.         Dr. Coser is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Lewis A. Coser, also a sociologist; a daughter, Dr. Ellen C. Perrin of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Steven M. of Melrose, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, for nearly two decades the dean of New York University's School of Social Work, died yesterday at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokeswoman.         Dr. Ehrenkranz, who was credited with enhancing the school's national reputation, joined its staff in 1966 and became its dean in 1977. In her more than 17 years as dean, the school became one of the largest schools of social work in the nation, enrolling more than 1,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs.         Under her leadership, the school also pioneered the holistic approach to clinical social work and became the first institution in the New York metropolitan area to offer a doctorate in clinical social work.         In recognition of her contributions, New York University had announced that the school would be renamed the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work. Jay Oliva, president of the university, said yesterday that there would be a renaming ceremony on Sept. 19. Was a Former Caseworker         Dr. Ehrenkranz received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, master's degrees in English from Temple University, in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr College and in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.         Before joining New York University, she served as a field instructor at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work and a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Social Work. She was also a caseworker and case supervisor in agencies for families and children. She was president of the New York State Association of Deans in 1980-81 and 1988-89.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Kasoff; two daughters, Pamela Ehrenkranz of New York City and Jean LeGrand of Chicago; a sister, Babette Cohen of Rosyln Heights, L.I., and 16 grandchildren.         Correction:  August 27, 1994, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, omitted a survivor. He is her son, Dr. Joel Ehrenkranz of New Vernon, N.J.       
         Sheila Campbell Williamson, the founding director of the Community Foundation of New Jersey in Morristown, died on Sunday at her home in Short Hills, N.J. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Williamson, who continued to work until earlier this month, helped set up the foundation in 1980 and became a leader of the community-foundation movement in the United States. Such organizations collect endowed funds from individuals, businesses or private foundations to benefit innovative projects in a specific area.         Mrs. Williamson became the executive director of what began as the Essex County Community Foundation in 1980. Starting with little more than a borrowed desk and a phone, she nurtured the foundation into an organization with assets of about $11.5 million and distributions of more than $6 million.         Its donors include such corporate giants as Johnson & Johnson and the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Boys Chorus, the New Jersey Symphony, AIDS education, neighborhood initiatives, civic improvements and various social services have been among the beneficiaries. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is a trustee and former president but the foundation operates with little fanfare,         Mrs. Williamson was active in many local organizations, including the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, the Association for Children in New Jersey and the Orange Orphan Society. She was a member of the Planning Board of Millburn and Short Hills.         Mrs. Williamson was a native of Glasgow. She graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., and received a master's degree in city and regional planning from Rutgers University. In the 1950's, she was a securities analyst for Bear, Stearns, one of the first women to be employed in that capacity on Wall Street.         Mrs. Williamson is survived by her husband, James G., and two daughters, Anne W. Holman of Short Hills and Christina Williamson of Manhattan.       
         Felisa Rincon de Gautier, Mayor of San Juan, P.R., from 1946 to 1969 and the only woman to hold that post, died on Friday in a nursing home in San Juan, where she had lived in recent months. She was 97.         She died after suffering a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.         She was appointed Mayor in 1946 to replace an incumbent who had resigned, and she was elected to office in later years. Running for another four-year term in 1964, she said, "After this term I want to lead my own life," and she did not run for re-election in 1968. Her other political work included membership on the Democratic National Committee.         Even before she became Mayor, Mrs. Rincon de Gautier, widely known as Dona Fela, worked on behalf of social causes, including the campaign to win Puerto Rican women the right to vote, which succeeded in 1932.         It was then that she went into politics, going on to press for child-care programs, centers for the elderly and legal aid for the poor. Her political power came in large part from the support of the city's poor residents, whom she organized within her Popular Democratic Party.         She worked hard to please the electorate. "My opponents campaign just before elections and then they disappear," she once said. "I start campaigning the day after the election and never stop."         She was also good at political repartee. After detractors said she had given city jobs to too many of her relatives, she replied: "I wish I had 20 more nieces. They work better -- for less."         As Mayor, she had a highly personal style that included enchanting local children by flying in planeloads of snow for Christmas parties. She maintained that personal touch even as San Juan grew, from a population of 180,000 when she first took office to 600,000 by 1961, when she was still meeting once a week with residents who needed advice or assistance.         But she also attended to larger matters, like public works. She was proud of having provided the city with well-equipped and hospitably managed dispensaries, as well as new schools and housing projects with nurseries and other amenities.         After stepping down as Mayor, she maintained her interest in politics. In 1992, at the age of 95, she was the oldest delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which was held in New York.         The eldest of eight children of a lawyer, she was born in Ceiba, 33 miles southeast of San Juan. She had to leave school at age 15 to care for her siblings.         Early in her life, she was a supporter of independence for Puerto Rico, but her views changed, and she went on to support the United States Commonwealth Constitution that came into effect in 1952.         In 1940, she married Jenaro A. Gautier, a lawyer who was secretary general of the Popular Democratic Party at the time. He died in 1971.       
         Amy Clampitt, known for her dense, ornate and allusive poetry, died on Saturday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 74 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Anne Close, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf.         Ms. Clampitt published her first full-length book of poetry, "The Kingfisher," when she was 63. It was a delayed but auspicious beginning. Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that the author "immediately merits consideration as one of our most distinguished contemporary poets." The work, which challenged readers with long strings of dependent clauses, an often obscure vocabulary and arcane literary allusions, ran counter to the prevailing taste for pared-down, plain speech. Instead, she offered "baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon," the poet Alfred Corn wrote in a review.         Ms. Clampitt was born in New Providence, Iowa, and grew up on a 125-acre farm. After earning a bachelor's degree with honors in English at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1941 she studied at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         She worked as a secretary and a writer at Oxford University Press from 1943 to 1951 and as reference librarian at the National Audubon Society from 1952 to 1959. Through the 1960's and most of the 70's, she was a freelance writer, editor and researcher. From 1977 to 1982 she was an editor at E. P. Dutton. Initially Self-Published         In college, Ms. Clampitt succumbed to the spell of Gerard Manley Hopkins, but she wrote little poetry at the time. In the 1950's, she made unsuccessful stabs at novel writing. It was not until the 60's that she began writing poetry in earnest, initially without success. In 1974, at her own expense, she published a poetry chapbook, "Multitudes, Multitudes." The work caught the eye of Howard Moss, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, who began publishing Ms. Clampitt regularly. In 1981, a second small collection, "The Isthmus," was published.         "The Kingfisher," published in 1983 by Alfred A. Knopf, immediately pushed its author to the front ranks of American poets. Organized around the elements earth, air, fire and water, it treated subjects as various as the plants and marine life of New England, John Lennon's murder, the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.         Comparing Ms. Clampitt to Hopkins, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, critics noted her pinpoint descriptions of the natural world that led to unexpected metaphysical insights and conclusions. She once referred to herself as "a poet of place," a characterization that she later revised to "a poet of displacement." From Life and Myth         "What the Light Was Like" (1985, Knopf) solidified its author's reputation. Like "The Kingfisher," it began with several poems about the New England coast, notably the book's title poem, an elegy for a drowned lobsterman.         In "Archaic Figure" (1987, Knopf), inspired in part by the author's travels in Greece, Ms. Clampitt used Greek myth to explore what Virginia Woolf called "the ancient consciousness of women." Her other major collections were "Westward" (1990, Knopf) and "A Silence Opens" (1994, Knopf).         She also published an essay collection, "Predecessors, et Cetera" (1991, University of Michigan Press) and edited "The Essential Donne" (1988, Ecco Press).         Ms. Clampitt received a fellowship award for distinguished poetic achievement from the Academy of American Poets in 1982 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. She was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         She is survived by her husband, Harold L. Korn; two brothers, Lawrence, of Brunswick, Me., and Philip, of Auburn Hills, Mich., and a sister, Beth, of Carlisle, Iowa.       
         Helene Thurman Martin Heinemann, a retired geriatric social worker, died on Thursday at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 88 and lived in New Canaan and Washington, Conn., before moving to Crosslands in 1977.         Her death followed a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Heinemann, a native of Harrisburg, Pa., graduated from Wellesley College and the New York School of Social Work.         She is survived by a son, H. Erich Heinemann of Great Neck, L.I., chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, investment bankers; a daughter, Marianne Russo of Oxford, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.; a brother, Frederick Martin of Orono, Me.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandson.         Her husband, Hans Heinemann, an investment banker, died in 1967.       
         Ruth Fizdale, who helped to make modern social work a profession, died on Sunday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86 and a resident of Patterson, N.Y.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke, according to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where she was an adjunct professor emeritus in community medicine.         Miss Fizdale made her mark during 19 years as executive director of the Arthur Lehman Counseling Service in Manhattan. At the service, which is defunct, she developed a fee-for-service system for use by private agencies. The purpose was to lift the welfare aura of charity from them.         Lehman Counseling was created for clients who could afford a reasonable fee. It also paid reasonable salaries, thus bolstering the professional image of its social workers.         Miss Fizdale chronicled the agency's first decade and a half in "Social Agency Structures and Accountability" (Burdick, 1974). The work became a casebook for graduate schools, social agencies and private practitioners as it set standards for social-work services on a fee basis for middle- and upper-income clients.         A month ago, the Columbia University School of Social Work established a Helen Rehr and Ruth Fizdale Professorship of Health and Mental Health. New York State recognized her as Social Worker of the Year in 1970, and a few years ago, the National Association of Social Work set up its Ruth Fizdale Fund in Social Welfare Studies in her honor.         She was long associated with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and its Department of Community Medicine. She was also an adjunct professor at the Hunter School of Social Work.         Miss Fizdale graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a master's at the Smith College School of Social Work and an advanced-study certificate from the University of Pennsylvania. She was a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers and its Competence Certification Board.         During World War II, she led a Veterans Administration program to restructure its staff and student training. She then served as a psychiatric caseworker at the Jewish Family Service's Mandel Clinic in Brooklyn and with the New York Association for New Americans.       
         Dr. Judith Krieger Gardner, a child psychologist, teacher and researcher at Brandeis University, died of an aneurysm on Saturday at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. She was 51 and lived in Belmont and West Tisbury, Mass.         She fell ill three weeks ago on a trek in Nepal with friends, her family said.         Dr. Gardner was an associate research professor at the Heller Graduate School of Advanced Studies and Social Welfare at Brandeis; she was acting director of the school two years ago.         She also taught a course on the history of child rearing at Harvard University and lectured at Boston University.         Born in Philadelphia, she graduated magna cum laude from the Connecticut College for Women in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard in 1971.         Dr. Gardner was a former research associate at Children's Hospital in Boston and a staff psychologist at the Judge Baker Center in Boston.         She was co-editor with Howard Gardner, her former husband, of many books, including the multivolume series "Classics in Psychology" and "Classics in Child Psychology" published by Ayer.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her daughter, Kerith, of Manhattan; two sons, Jay and Andrew of Belmont, and her parents, Sylvia and Bernard Krieger of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Helen U. Phillips, a sociologist who researched group theory as a means to helping people solve their problems, died on Dec. 3 in the Broomall Presbyterian Nursing Home in Broomall, Pa, a Philadelphia suburb. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, said the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Phillips became a professor emeritus in 1967.         She began her lifelong study of the emerging field of social group work when she worked at a Minneapolis settlement house in the mid-1920's. There she began to see how being a member of a group empowered individuals and helped them solve problems with a minimum of supervision.         Her ground-breaking book, "Essentials of Social Group Work Skill" (University of Pennsylvania, 1973), was used to train students in social work for many years.         Born in Jamestown, N.D., she earned a bachelor's degree at Oberlin College and a master's from Western Reserve University. She taught at the University of Minnesota before joining the University of Pennsylvania, where she received a doctorate in sociology in 1956.         She is survived by a sister, Florence Pollack of Athens, Ga.       
         Frances Prince Schuman, the founding chairwoman of the National Friends of Public Broadcasting and the wife of the composer William Schuman, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         She died after a brief illness, said her son, Anthony.         Mrs. Schuman was the founder and first chairwoman of the Friends of Thirteen and the National Friends of Public Broadcasting, and served for many years on the board of WNET Channel 13. With the director John Houseman she guided the development of the Acting Company, a theater group of drama graduates that her husband established when he was the president of the Juilliard School.         Mrs. Schuman, known as Frankie, was born in New York City in 1913 and graduated from Barnard College. Her early career was in social services, with a focus on people with disabilities. She was a staff member of the New York State Employment Service and a director of the Vocational Advisory Service. She was a founding director of the Cerebral Palsy Association and the Urban League of Westchester County, and at the time of her death was on the boards of the MacDowell Colony and the American Composers Orchestra.         In addition to her son, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Andrea, of Newton Highlands, Mass., and a grandson, Joshua Weiss.
