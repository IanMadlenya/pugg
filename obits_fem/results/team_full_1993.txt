         Julia Jones-Pugliese, who took up fencing as a New York University student in 1927 and five years later began a 60-year career as one the nation's premier coaches, died on Saturday after coaching Hunter College's men's team at a meet at St. John's.         She was 84, and according to her family, she suffered a heart attack at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan.         The first woman to coach a collegiate fencing team, Mrs. Jones-Pugliese led N.Y.U. to national championships in 1933 and 1938 and coached the Hunter team to a national title in 1970. She had been the Hunter coach since 1956.         For Mrs. Jones-Pugliese, stature was athletic destiny. Deciding she was too short to join the N.Y.U. basketball team, she took up fencing and helped found the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association. The association, whose membership grew from 4 to more than 70 colleges, conducts what is considered the oldest collegiate championship for women in any sport.         Mrs. Jones-Pugliese's husband, Anthony Pugliese, a painter and sculptor, died in 1953. She is survived by a sister, Erma Stim of Plainview, L.I.; a daughter, Penelope Shaw, an instructor in modern dance and Yoga at Hunter; two sons, Patri, who teaches physics at Harvard, and Paul, a cartographer for Time magazine; six grandchildren, and one great grandson.       
         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Bee Schenken, a leading contract bridge player who won seven national titles, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.         The cause of death was a stroke after a long illness, said her daughter, Sandra Bandler of Manhattan.         Mrs. Schenken had an unusual string of successes in national women's team championships, winning in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1964, 1968 and 1969. She also won the national mixed pairs title in 1957.         She was a runner-up in five national events, including the prestigious Reisinger Teams in 1966. Many of these successes, including eight open-pair victories in the international tournament in Deauville, France, were with her husband, Howard Schenken, who died in 1979. He was regarded by many as the world's best individual player in the period from 1930 to 1960.         Mrs. Schenken was an active fund-raiser for charities, including the Red Cross and the United Jewish Appeal.         In addition to her daughter Sandra, she is survived by another daughter, Susan Ruskin of Boynton Beach, Fla.; a brother, Nate Krevitz of Bakersfield, Calif.; three sisters, Edna Goldberg, Minnie Krevitz and Molly Moise, all of Griffith, Ind., and five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Virginia Lee Bracker, a retired reporter and foreign correspondent for The New York Times, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She had been ill for a long time with a variety of ailments and her death was a suicide, said her friend and executor, Robert Riggs.         Mrs. Bracker was a women's-news reporter for The Washington Post who used the byline Virginia Lee Warren when she married Milton Bracker of The Times in 1936. They became a Times reporting team working in Italy, Mexico and Latin America and she retained her old byline throughout her career with The Times.         She left the staff in 1951 but shared a George Polk Award for foreign reporting with Mr. Bracker the next year for chronicling the repressive regime of Juan Domingo Peron in Argentina. Mr. Bracker died in his sleep in 1964 at 54 in Rome, where he was bureau chief.         His wife rejoined The Times that year in New York as a women's-news reporter. She retired as a reporter for the Family/Style department in 1978.         Born Virginia Lee Smith in Winchester, Va., Mrs. Bracker was hired by The Washington Post in 1933. She adopted the pen name Warren to avoid confusion with another reporter whose name was Smith.       
         Heather Farr, the professional golfer whose four-and-a-half-year battle with cancer won her scores of admirers from inside and outside the golf world, died Saturday night in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 28.         Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in July 1989, Farr underwent more than 15 operations, ranging from a radical mastectomy to breast reconstruction to bone marrow transplants and spinal surgery.         Through all the setbacks, she persevered, which characterized her approach to golf as well. Although she was just 5 feet 1 inch, she seemed bigger in stature.         "One of the things I always remember about her was that she walked so erect," said JoAnne Carner, the Hall of Fame golfer. "It was like she was saying, 'I'm not 5-1, I'm 6 feet.' "         Lessons at 7         Farr, born and raised in Phoenix, began her golf career at the age of 7, when she first took lessons from Bob Day, then the professional at Coronado Golf Course in Scottsdale. It was an unusually young age to begin lessons, but Farr's father, Gerald, convinced Day that Heather was ready.         "He told me that she followed him around all 18 holes every weekend," Day told The Arizona Republic. "I said: 'Stop right there. Anybody who can walk 18 holes and watch somebody else play golf, well, she's ready.' "         Because of her small stature, Farr could not hit the ball as far as many of her peers. But she made up for that with an excellent short game, a wonderful putting stroke and passionate aggressiveness.         She quickly developed into one of the country's most successful amateurs. At 13, she won the Arizona State Amateur. By the time she was 15, she was named the American Junior Golf Association player of the year for the first of two times.         'Like an Ambassador'         Under the tutelage of Arch Watkins, her game continued to develop in college at Arizona State University, where she was named to two all-America teams. Farr's coach at Arizona State, Linda Vollstedt, said Farr's influence there was enduring.         "She was like an ambassador for our golf program," Vollstedt said. "Everywhere she went, people sought out Heather."         Farr played on the 1984 Curtis Cup team and the 1984 World Amateur team. Two years later, at 20, she became the youngest player from the 1985 Ladies Professional Golf Association's qualifying school to make the L.P.G.A. Tour.         Her indefatigable nature and relentlessly upbeat attitude quickly won Farr many friends on the very competitive L.P.G.A. circuit. Twelve L.P.G.A. players were at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital-North Saturday night when Farr died. "She never quit," said a former L.P.G.A. president, Judy Dickinson.         Spirit of Perseverance         In an interview last year, Farr characterized her philosophy on dealing with all of her problems. "You play through it," she said. "That's what you do. You just play through it."         She applied that philosophy to the golf course and to her medical battles. Like many rookies, Farr struggled in her first season, going eight tournaments without winning any prize money. But in her three L.P.G.A. seasons before the discovery of breast cancer, she improved each year. The 1988 season was her best. She won $75,821 and finished tied for third at the Mazda Classic. In the middle of the next season, the lump in her breast that originally had been diagnosed as benign was found to be cancerous.         Eleven months after Farr's first chemotheraphy treatments ended, doctors found that the cancer had spread to her skull and spine. A tumor on her back was removed, followed by a bone-marrow transplant. After the bone marrow transplant, a tumor on her skull and lesions on her hip were discovered. In March, while the cancer was in a brief remission, Farr was married to Goran Lingmerth, a former kicker for the Cleveland Browns. She is survived by her husband; her father, Gerald; her mother, Sharon, and her sister, Missy Farr-Kay, all of Phoenix.       
         June Mellies Reno, a nationally known magazine writer about family and health issues, died on Thursday at the Linda Manor Nursing Home in Northampton, Mass. Mrs. Reno, who lived in Amherst, Mass., was 72.         The cause was liver failure, said a daughter, Penny Robbins.         Mrs. Reno was an alumna of Washington University in St. Louis and of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. From 1945 to 1970, she collaborated with her first husband as the freelance writing team of Jhan and June Robbins, whose articles appeared in Readers' Digest, McCall's, Redbook, Good Housekeeping and This Week.         Her second husband, Earl Reno, died in 1975.         She is survived by two daughters, Penny, of Haydenville, Mass., and Meg, of Northampton; two sons, Tom, of Brooklyn, and David, of Roxbury, Mass., and nine grandchildren.
