         Anna Mikhailovna Larina, the widow of Nikolai I. Bukharin, a father of the Bolshevik Revolution who was executed under Stalin, and herself a survivor of the Soviet gulag, died of lung cancer here on Saturday, her daughter, Nadezhda Fadeyeva, said. She was 82.         When Bukharin, a trusted comrade of Lenin and a rival to Stalin, was condemned in 1938 in the last of the Moscow show trials, his young wife was banished and spent 20 years in exile and Soviet prison camps. Before they were separated, Bukharin instructed his wife to memorize his final testament, in which he implored future generations of Communist leaders to exonerate him. Not  daring to write it down, she later recalled, she used to lull herself to sleep in prison by repeating her husband's words silently to herself "like a prayer."  It was not published in full until 1988.         Miss Larina's autobiography, "This I Cannot Forget," created a sensation when it was published in Russia in 1988 as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rehabilitation of Bukharin. But long before, while she was still in exile, Miss  Larina waged a tireless campaign to exonerate her husband after Stalin's death,  writing long, detailed letters to Nikita Khrushchev and his successors demanding Bukharin's reinstatement in the pantheon of revolutionary heroes.         Miss Larina's book was an instant best-seller. A harrowing prison memoir as well as a loving, uncritical tribute to Bukharin, it is also one of the few first-person accounts of repression and prison life by a fallen member of the Bolshevik ruling elite. Miss Larina was the adopted daughter of a leading Communist revolutionary, Yuri Larin, and grew up in the Metropole Hotel, the residence of many Soviet leaders, dandled on the knee of Lenin. She had known Bukharin, who was 25 years older than she and a friend of her father's, all her  life. She was 16 when they became engaged -- Stalin hand-delivered her first love letter to Bukharin -- and 20 when they married.         She was 24 when she was sent into exile and separated from their infant son,  Yuri, whom she did not see again until he was 20. The boy was passed around by relatives and later raised in a state orphanage. He only learned who his father  was in 1956, when he was allowed to visit his mother in exile. She was released  in 1959, and returned to Moscow with her second husband, Fyodor Fadeyev, a fellow prisoner she met in Siberia, and their two children.         Stephen F. Cohen, a Princeton University historian who published a biography  of Bukharin in 1973, met clandestinely with the widow during the Brezhnev era and became a close friend, discovering in the archives and returning to her the  last love letter Bukharin wrote to her, on Jan. 15, 1938, from prison. He was shot two months later.         Mr. Cohen described Miss Larina as "the last living link to the generation that made the revolution." He added that it was her remarkable personality that  cemented their friendship. "She lost everything," Mr. Cohen said, "but she showed no bitterness. She endured this horrible experience but it didn't deform  her psychologically. In 1988, she was able to resume public life in a way that astonished people."         After winning the campaign to rehabilitate her husband, Miss Larina devoted her last years to trying to recover Bukharin's long-hidden prison writings, philosophical essays, poems and also an autobiographical novel, which were unearthed from secret party archives in 1992. The novel is scheduled to be published in English by Columbia University Press later this year.         In addition to her daughter and her son Yuri Larin, Miss Larina is survived by her second son, Mikhail Fadeyev.       
         Audrey Meadows, whose portrayal of a working-class housewife on "The Honeymooners" placed her in the pantheon of television comedy's grandes dames, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, the actress Jayne Meadows.         Audrey Meadows was the second actress to play Alice Kramden, whose bus driver husband, Ralph, threatened her weekly with a fist-propelled trip to the moon. "The Honeymooners" began in 1951 as part of "Cavalcade of Stars" with Pert Kelton as Alice. When it became part of "The Jackie Gleason Show" on CBS, Miss Meadows took over the role. "The Honeymooners" became a series on its own in 1955, and was initially something of a flop, running for only 39 episodes instead of the 70-plus that were planned. It was only later that the series, which is still being replayed on cable and airline flights, became what the television business calls a classic.         Miss Meadows's route to the role of Alice was decidedly circuitous. She was born in 1922 in China, where her father, Francis James Meadows Cotter, was an Episcopal minister. He brought the family back to the United States five years later and eventually become rector of Christ Church in Sharon, Conn.         Miss Meadows began her career as a coloratura soprano, making her concert debut at 16 in Carnegie Hall. It was her sister, Jayne, two years older, who steered her into acting.         Things moved quickly. After a World War II stint for the U.S.O. that included Mike Todd's production of "Mexican Hayride," Miss Meadows joined "The Bob and Ray Show" on NBC Television in 1951, playing all the female roles and ducking below the camera's eye to change costumes. At one point, she sang an opera aria  standing on her head.         In her spare time, she played the lead opposite Phil Silvers for 15 weeks in  the Broadway production of "Top Banana." And then she heard that Jackie Gleason, a hot new name in television, was looking for someone to replace Miss Kelton, who was ill, as Alice on his variety show.         The subsequent story is right out of the legends cherished in show business.  Gleason took one look at Miss Meadows and dismissed her as too young and too pretty. Hiring a photographer, she went home, washed off her makeup, got into a  frumpy housedress and sent the photos to Gleason, who hired her without even hearing her read lines.         During the life of "The Jackie Gleason Show," Miss Meadows appeared in different guises, including a sophisticated girlfriend of the character Reggie Van Gleason.         When Gleason decided he had had enough of an hourlong show every week, the pieces for a new half-hour show were in place: Gleason as Ralph Kramden; Miss Meadows as Alice; Art Carney as Ed Norton, and Joyce Randolph as his wife, Trixie.         No matter what else they did, each performer would forever after be fixed in  the public mind as the perfect embodiment of these hilarious and touching working-class characters whose problems seemed to connect with all of America. Each episode was a compact morality play. Ralph could keep on saying: "One of these days, Alice. Pow! Right in the kisser." But the audience knew he'd wind up admitting, "Baby you're the greatest!"         Miss Meadows held her own by remaining the calm sarcastic center around which the brilliant physical comedy of Gleason and Carney swirled. Listening to Ralph's harebrained get-rich schemes, Alice would stand with arms folded and eyes disdainful. More than once, Gleason publicly praised her ability to ad-lib  and keep the sketch on course. Once when Ralph burned himself and screamed, "Isn't there any lard around here," Miss Meadows simply took a long look at Gleason and said, "About 300 pounds of it."         The performance was perhaps too good. In a business notorious for typecasting, Miss Meadows quickly discovered that every producer wanted to keep  her in the kitchen. As recently as last year, in a New York Times interview with Bryan Miller, she lamented that she was lucky back then to get guest shots on the Dinah Shore and Red Skelton shows.         She virtually retired from acting after her 1961 marriage to Robert Six, the  chairman of Continental Airlines, turning her attention to business activities and her family. But she did have a recurring role as Ted Knight's mother-in-law  on the 1980's sitcom "Too Close for Comfort."         Mr. Six died in 1986.         Miss Meadows was adamant in her praise of Gleason, who died in 1987. After several less-than-flattering biographies were published about "The Great One," Miss Meadows wrote, with Joe Daly, her own "Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner." She called the book, which was published last year, "a love letter...to my television husband Ralph Kramden."         Miss Meadows, a woman of loyalty and dignity, continued to be beset by autograph-seeking fans in restaurants and department stores. Alice had become a beloved fixture in American pop culture. People still wanted to tell her that  "Baby, you're the greatest."       
         Jacquetta Hawkes, archeologist and author, who was the widow of the playwright and novelist J. B. Priestley, died on Monday at Cheltenham General Hospital in London. She was 85, and lived in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Camden.         In "Man on Earth," "A Land" and many other books, Ms. Hawkes searched for the humanity within science. She said, "Let us have the courage to accept the inner  experience that tells us we are something more and that we may be part of a process much greater still." Her fervent interest was in the world of prehistory.         Discovering a Neanderthal skeleton, she said: "I was conscious of this vanished being and myself as part of an unbroken stream of consciousness . . . With an imaginative effort it is possible to see the eternal present in which all days, all the seasons of the plain, stand in enduring unity." In her polymathic career, she was also a poet and novelist and, in collaboration with her husband, a playwright.         Reviewing "Time and the Priestleys, the Story of a Friendship," Diana Collins's 1994 double biography of Mr. Priestley and Ms. Hawkes, Peter Ackroyd said there was no reason Ms. Hawkes "should be remembered as the wife of anyone  . . . since her own story is as interesting and as compelling as that of Priestley himself."         That story began in her childhood when she dug in her family garden, which had once been part of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. As Mr. Ackroyd said, "She discovered nothing, but found within herself a lasting treasure; it was her love of learning and her passion for the past." It was her goal in life "to retrieve  the landscapes of history."         Jacquetta Hopkins was born on Aug. 10, 1910, in Cambridge, which became the center of her early life. She graduated from the university with a degree in archeology and anthropology. In 1933, she married Christopher Hawkes, a professor of archeology, and they had a son, Nicolas. Her interest in archeology took her on expeditions to Palestine as well as England. During and immediately  after World War II, she held several government posts and was the founder of the United Kingdom Commission for Unesco.         Her 1951 book, "A Land" (with illustrations by Henry Moore), was based on her work as archeological adviser for the Festival of Britain. In his review in the  New York Times Book Review, Stanley Edgar Hyman said that Ms. Hawkes had told the "story of the shaping of the earth and the development of life with simple eloquence" and described "A Land" as "a triumph of skill as well as a work of love." Through the next 30 years Ms. Hawkes was a prolific author, writing bold  and often poetic books about archeology, geology and the history of mankind.         In 1947 she met Mr. Priestley at a Unesco conference in Mexico City. They were drawn together by the "magnetism of polarity," said Ms. Hawkes. She divorced Mr. Hawkes, and in 1953 married Mr. Priestley. It was his third marriage. She and Mr. Priestley collaborated on several projects, including the  play "Dragon's Mouth." When it was produced Off Broadway in 1955, Brooks Atkinson said in his review that the authors had "succeeded in writing a remarkably stimulating conversation" that was second only to Shaw's "Don Juan in Hell."         Ms. Hawkes's books included "A Woman as Great as the World," a collection of  fables and a science fiction novelette; "Journey Down a Rainbow," a personalized account of a visit to the United States written with Mr. Priestley; "Providence  Island: An Archeological Tale"; "King of the Two Lands: The Pharaoh, Akhenaten," and "Dawn of the Gods," a study of Greece in the Bronze Age. In the 1970's she wrote "The First Great Civilizations: Life in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and  Egypt," and atlases of ancient archeology and early human life. "A Quest for Love," in 1981, was an autobiographical novel.         Mr. Priestley died in 1984. Ms. Hawkes is survived by her son from her first  marriage.       
         Lola Beltran, the soulful Mexican singer whose achingly emotional renditions  of mariachi ballads made her known as Lola the Great to generations of Latin Americans, died on Sunday night in Mexico City. During a career that spanned five decades, she made a point of refusing to discuss her age, but she was believed to be in her mid-60's.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Maria Elena Leal, said in newspaper reports.         Among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Lola la Grande was held in high esteem for her ability to capture and reproduce in her music what they consider the melancholy essence of life. Song after song found her confronting suffering, loneliness, abandonment or loss with an equanimity that her millions of listeners in the Spanish-speaking world found inspiring and deeply moving.         In a tribute to Ms. Beltran written in 1994, the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes declared that "passion and desire, joy and risk, tenderness and the cry  for existence are the wings of this dove that is the voice of our lady Lola Beltran." Like most Mexicans, he added, "I have spent my life living and writing and loving and traveling with the voice of Lola Beltran close to me, on records, over the airwaves, but above all in the soundtrack of memory."         Ms. Beltran suffered a heart attack on March 16 and had been hospitalized, but she vowed to keep singing "as long as the body holds up." Revived by doctors after her heart had stopped beating for a reported seven minutes, she remarked,  "I fought death with all my might, and God in His infinite compassion has let me live for a little while longer."         Though Ms. Beltran's devotees ranged from presidents to peasants, she was especially admired by her fellow musicians. Her remarkable sense of phrasing, inflection and drama influenced a whole generation of younger vocalists, both men and women, inside and out of Mexico.         "Singers don't come any more real than Lola Beltran," Linda Ronstadt said in  1988 after releasing an album that included several songs associated with Ms. Beltran. "She's a world-class singer, up there rubbing shoulders with Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf."         In both her private and professional life, Ms. Beltran played the role of diva to the hilt. She dressed extravagantly, was fond of furs and ornate jewels  and relished the deference her admirers showered on her. She consequently earned a second nickname, "La Reina," or "The Queen."         Onstage, whether performing for Mexican immigrants at county fairs in Texas or at state dinners for Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle or the King of Spain, her bearing was indeed regal. She would halt her orchestra in mid-measure with an authoritative wave of the hand, or in moments of great emotion clutch the rebozo, or shawl, that was her trademark.         Her origins, however, were modest. Maria Lucila Beltran was born in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa, where her father, Pedro Beltran, was a mine manager. Her mother, a housewife who liked to sing around the house, exposed her daughter both to the hits of the day and older standards.         In her early years, Ms. Beltran sang at family gatherings or to the Carmelite nuns who educated her. But in 1953, with her mother, Maria de los Angeles Ruiz,  in tow as her chaperone, Ms. Beltran moved to Mexico City with hopes of entering show business. She took a secretarial job at XEW, a radio station known throughout Mexico as the home of the Mariachi Vargas, the most popular group of  the genre.         Ms. Beltran later would tell how she pestered the group until they gave her a chance to show off her vocal skills. The purity of her voice and her masterly technique immediately won them over, and within a year she was the star of her own program and the most popular female mariachi singer in Mexico. "Even now, every time I go by the station, I make the sign of the cross," she said in a 1988 interview, as a gesture of gratitude for good fortune.         Through the Mariachi Vargas, Ms. Beltran also met Tomas Mendez, the songwriter who would go on to compose many of her most successful songs. Several of those numbers, "Cucurrucucu Paloma" and "Tres Dias" in particular, became hits everywhere -- the United States included -- and made Ms. Beltran a star throughout the Spanish-speaking world.         "When I hear a song, I want it to tell me something," Ms. Beltran said in the same interview. "It can tell the story of a great love or of a tremendous sadness, but it has to have emotion and truth. The song has to make it worth my  while to sing it."         Though many of Ms. Beltran's contemporaries have long since faded from the scene, she maintained her appeal among those who consider themselves hip and contemporary. The Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, for instance, used Ms.  Beltran's version of "Soy Infeliz," or "I Am Unhappy," as the opening theme of his 1988 hit, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."         All told, Ms. Beltran recorded more than 100 albums, with total sales estimated in the tens of millions. She also appeared in more than 50 movies, most of them Mexican musicals of indifferent quality that owed their commercial  success to her remarkable popularity and her dark, keening voice.         Ms. Beltran is survived by her daughter, born of her marriage to the bullfighter and actor Alfredo Leal.       
         Mary Lavin, whose short stories and novels about the conflicts in the hearts  of her fellow Irish men and women transcended mere tales of life in Ireland, died on Monday at a nursing home here. She was 83.         Ms. Lavin was the author of 19 collections of short stories and three novels. She won three Guggenheim Fellowships and a number of literary awards, including  the Katherine Mansfield Prize, in 1961. Her stories appeared regularly in The New Yorker.         Her death was front-page news in The Irish Times, whose chief book critic, Eileen Battersby, called her "one of modern Irish fiction's most subversive voices" and said, "Her art explored often brutal tensions, disappointments and frustrations dictating the relationships within so-called 'normal' families."         Ms. Lavin's favorite form was the short story, which she once likened to "a flash of lightning lighting up the whole landscape all at once." In a 1976 interview she was quoted as saying: "Publishers are definitely unfair to short-story writers. Since the essence of the short story is its conciseness, an addiction to change is an occupational disease and not the self-indulgence publishers think." She also said: "I don't think a story has to have a beginning, middle and end. I think of it more as an arrow in flight."         Critics often compared Ms. Lavin's work to that of other acclaimed Irish writers, including Liam O'Flaherty and Sean O'Faolain, and also perceived echoes of Balzac, Chekhov and Saki. Her writing influenced the work of others, as well, including the novelist William Trevor.         Ms. Lavin said her childhood reading of Jane Austen influenced her writing. She said that, as a realist, her writing was "only looking closer than normal into the human heart, whose vagaries and contrarieties have their own integral design." In an appreciation in The Irish Times, Maurice Harmon, professor emeritus of Anglo-Irish Literature at University College in Dublin, wrote: "She  drew upon her own experience. Her stories explore and reflect the patterns of her life: the return of the little girl from America to the strange, puritanical society of her mother's people" in Western Ireland.         "At the high point of her career," he continued, "she wrote about widows who  refuse to be passive in the face of death, who keep their memories of love and go forth to encounter experience with openness and with the wisdom of years."         Mary Lavin was born on June 11, 1912, of immigrant parents in East Walpole, Mass. When she was 10 the family moved back to Athenry, in Western Ireland. She  wrote her first short story in 1938. Her first collection, "Tales From Bective Bridge," won the James Tate Black Memorial Prize in 1942 and helped establish her career.         Her short-story collections include "The Long Ago" (1944), "The Becker Wives" (1946), "A Single Lady" (1957), "In the Middle of the Fields" (1966) and "The Shrine and Other Stories" (1976). She published her first novel, "The House in Clewe Street," in 1945; her second, "Mary O'Grady," appeared in 1950.         She served as president of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1971.         Ms. Lavin's first marriage was to William Walsh, a lawyer, who died in 1954.  They had three daughters, who survive. In 1969 she married Michael McDonald Scott, a former Roman Catholic priest, who died in 1990. In recent years her health failed and she lived in a nursing home.         Her stories were characterized by arresting opening and closing lines. One story, "Happiness," begins with "Mother had a lot to say" and ends: "Mother made the last effort of her life and grasped at Bea's meaning. She let out a sigh, and, closing her eyes, she sank back, and this time her head sank so deep into the pillow that it would have been dented had it been a pillow of stone." Another, "A Memory," begins, "James did all right for a man on his own," and ends, "Under a weight of bitterness too great to be borne, his face was pressed  into the wet leaves and, when he gulped for breath, the rotted leaves were sucked into his mouth."       
         Marguerite Duras, author of the best-selling novel "The Lover" and one of the most widely read French writers of the postwar era, died today at her home in Paris. She was 81.         Miss Duras, who was also a prolific playwright, film maker and screenwriter,  was best known for the way she used her early life in French Indochina as the inspiration for many of her works, including "The Lover," the story of her clandestine teen-age romance with a wealthy young Chinese man. Yet perhaps what  most characterized her 53-year literary career was her simple, terse writing style, as if language itself were merely a vehicle for conveying passion and desire, pain and despair. The mysteries of love and sex consumed her, but she had no room for sentimentality in her works, or indeed, in her life.         I write about love, yes, but not about tenderness," she said in a 1990 interview. "I don't like tender people. I myself am very harsh. When I love someone, I desire them. But tenderness supposes the exclusion of desire." Ever provocative in her use of language, she always bowed to the supremacy of words.  "Acting doesn't bring anything to a text," Miss Duras wrote of her work for cinema and theater. "On the contrary, it detracts from it -- lessens its immediacy and depth, weakens its muscles and dilutes its blood."         In the theater, this seemed to matter little, and her plays continue to be performed regularly in France. However, despite the enormous success of her screenplay for Alain Resnais's 1960 classic, "Hiroshima, Mon Amour," few of the  19 movies she wrote and directed herself did well, not least because words often entirely replaced action. Until her 70th birthday, her novels had a loyal  albeit small readership. With the publication of "The Lover" in 1984, however, Miss Duras reached a mass audience in France and abroad. The book sold more than two million copies and was made into a well-received film in 1992 by Jean-Jacques Annaud.         Because she considered her words to be sacrosanct, she often had stormy dealings with movie directors who adapted her novels, among them Peter Brook, Tony Richardson and Jules Dassin. And when Mr. Annaud altered her screenplay for "The Lover," Miss Duras broke with him and turned her text into yet another semi-autobiographical novel, "The Lover From Northern China." She described that book, published in 1991, as a "reappropriation" of "The Lover," yet once again she seemed to be reinventing her life to a point where it became impossible to know whether her original novel, Mr. Annaud's film or her second version of the  story was the closest to reality. To Miss Duras, of course, this did not matter.         She was born on April 4, 1914, in Gia Dinh, near Saigon. Her parents, Henri and Marie Donnadieu (she changed her name to Duras in the 1930's), were teachers in France's colonial service. She was only a child when her father died, and her first memories were of economic hardship, above all after her mother invested the family's savings in a disastrous rice-farming venture.         After attending school in Saigon, Miss Duras moved to France at the age of 18 to study law and political science. After graduation, she worked as a secretary  in the French Ministry of the Colonies until 1941, but by then Nazi Germany had  occupied France. In 1943, she joined the Resistance in a small group that included Francois Mitterrand, who remained a friend until his recent death.         In 1939, Miss Duras married the writer Robert Antelme, who was arrested and deported to Germany during the war. By the time he returned from Dachau concentration camp in 1945 (he was the subject of her 1985 book "La Douleur," later published in the United States as "The War"), she was already involved with Dionys Mascolo, who was to become her second husband and with whom she had  a son, Jean.         In the late 1940's, Miss Duras joined the French Communist Party, and though  she later resigned, she always described herself a Marxist. Yet perhaps her strongest political stance was her contempt for Gen. Charles de Gaulle. "He never pronounced the word Jew after the war," she said in the 1990 interview. "Many people think I am Jewish, and that always pleases me."         Her first book, "Les Impudents," was published in 1943, and from that time, she lived off her writing, gradually building a body of work that included more than 70 novels, plays, screenplays and adaptations. She eventually acquired a country home in Normandy, but her book-lined Left Bank apartment on the Rue St.-Benoit remained her Paris home from 1942 until her death.         For many years, she struggled with alcoholism -- a subject she frequently addressed in her writings -- and her health was further shattered by emphysema.  But in the 1980's, long separated from Mr. Mascolo, she also found love again in an unusual relationship with a young homosexual writer, Yann Andrea Steiner, with whom she shared her final years.         Late last year, struggling again with illness, Miss Duras published "That's All," a tiny 54-page book that seemed intended to be her literary adieu to her readers, to Mr. Steiner and to herself. Written between November 1994 and last August, with each occasional entry carrying a date, it consisted of poetic bursts of love, fear and despair, as if all too aware that her death was near.         The very last entry, on the afternoon of Aug. 1, 1995, read:         "I think it is all over. That my life is finished.         "I am no longer anything.         "I have become an appalling sight.         "I am falling apart.         "Come quickly.         "I no longer have a mouth, no longer a face."         She is survived by her son and Mr. Steiner.       
         Virginia Donaldson, the press agent for the New York City Ballet from 1966 to 1982, died on Wednesday at her home in Chicago. She was 74.         The cause was heart failure, said Jack Hakman, a friend.         Ms. Donaldson worked with City Ballet during the years of some of its greatest triumphs, helping to create press campaigns for the Stravinsky Festivals of 1972 and 1982, the Ravel Festival of 1979 and the Tchaikovsky Festival of 1981.         Ms. Donaldson, who was born in Chicago, fell in love with ballet as a child.  Early ballet classes led to a friendship with the choreographer Leonide Massine  and his family, which in turn led to her career as a press agent. In addition to press work for Massine, she also worked for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and  several other troupes, including American Ballet Theater.         After her retirement from City Ballet, she did freelance work with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, the Old Globe Theater in San Diego and Maria Tallchief's Ballet Chicago, and made herself available for informal assistance to ballet companies coming through Chicago.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Shelley List, a novelist and a producer of the television series "Cagney and  Lacey," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Venice, Calif.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Jonathan Estrin, who was also her longtime business partner.         Ms. List was born in Manhattan. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Reed College in 1951 and a master's degree in literature from Teachers College of Columbia University in 1952. In the 1960's she reviewed theater for the Westport News in Westport, Conn., and wrote feature articles for the Fairpress in Fairfield, Conn.         After writing the novels "Did You Love Daddy When I Was Born?" (1972) and "Nobody Makes Me Cry" (1975), Ms. List moved to California to try her hand at television writing. She sold her first treatment, which was made into the 1979 movie "And Baby Makes Six," with Colleen Dewhurst. Ms. List wrote the script.         Beginning in the 1980's, she and her husband created, wrote and produced the  mini-series "Between Friends," which was based on Ms. List's novel "Nobody Makes Me Cry"; "Daniel Steele's 'Jewels,' " "Amazing Grace" and "Barbara Taylor Bradford's 'Remember.'

         Jo Van Fleet, who won an Academy Award, a Tony Award and other honors for her portrayal of proud, stoical women, died yesterday at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. She was 81.         Ms. Van Fleet was known as an actress's actress, a highly skilled professional who worked with equal ease onstage, in films and on television. For her first screen appearance in 1955, she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for playing James Dean's mother in Elia Kazan's film "East of Eden." Two years later, she won a Tony Award as best featured actress for her role as the irritable Jessie Mae Watts in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         In her other signature role, in Mr. Kazan's "Wild River," she was Ella Garth, an 80-year-old matriarch who refuses to leave her island home despite the fact that it is about to be flooded by the Tennessee Valley Authority. In that film, Montgomery Clift played a sympathetic Government official.         Over the years she came to be known for playing mothers of diverse ethnic backgrounds, with the range running from naturalistic drama to absurdist comedy. She was Anthony Perkins's mother in "Look Homeward, Angel" on Broadway; the original smothering mama, Madame Rosepettle, in Arthur Kopit's "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad," and Paul Newman's mother in the movie "Cool Hand Luke."         Her maternal gallery included the wicked stepmother in the 1965 television revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella." The same year, she followed Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in the 20th-anniversary production of "The Glass Menagerie."         Ms. Van Fleet, who was a member of the Actors Studio, often credited Mr. Kazan with having a major influence on her career. In addition to their film work, he directed her onstage in George Tabori's "Flight Into Egypt" and Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," in which she created the role of Camille.         She was born in Oakland, Calif., and began her theatrical training at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. After studying with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, she made her New York debut in "The Winter's Tale" in 1946. In 1950, she played Regan to Louis Calhern's "King Lear." In the  1950's and 60's, she was often on Broadway and occasionally Off Broadway (in "Rosemary" and "The Alligators," a double bill by Molly Kazan).         With "East of Eden" she began a flourishing movie career. Her other films included "The Rose Tattoo," "I'll Cry Tomorrow," "A King and Four Queens," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," "This Angry Age," "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" and "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight." In the 1970's, she often acted in regional theater.         Ms. Van Fleet was married to William Bales, a dancer and choreographer who died in 1990.         She is survived by a son, Michael, of Toronto, and a granddaughter.       
         Brigitte Helm, the German actress who defined the unobtainable, cool-eyed screen vamp as the haunting teen-age star of Fritz Lang's futuristic 1926 masterpiece, "Metropolis," died on Tuesday in Ascona, Switzerland, where she had lived in seclusion for more than 30 years. By her own account, she was 88.         She was the most sought-after actress of the glory days of the German film industry, a tall blond beauty who starred in more than 35 movies and set directors against one another in the competition for her services. Ms. Helm was  regarded as such a perfect embodiment of the era's ideal of cool sophistication  that when she turned Josef von Sternberg down for the starring role in "Blue Angel," he had to settle for Marlene Dietrich.         Yet for all the acclaim she received for such roles as her portrayal of a blind girl in Georg Wilhelm Pabst's "Love of Jeanne Ney," or as a bored aristocratic wanton in his "Crisis," Ms. Helm could never eclipse the role, or rather roles, in which the good Maria, an oppressed working girl, is transformed into an evil robotic doppelganger of herself in Lang's "Metropolis."         Even today, 70 years after it was released, "Metropolis," is not only a cult  classic, it is regularly listed among the half-dozen most important films ever made. This is a tribute, to be sure, to Lang's grotesque science-fiction vision, and the array of fabulous special effects he used to bring it to the screen. The film depicts the world of 2006, a time, Lang envisioned, when a ruling class lives in decadent luxury in the lofty heights of skyscrapers linked by aerial railways, while beneath the streets slavelike workers toil in unbearable conditions to sustain their masters.         But for all the steam and special effects, for many who have seen the movie in its various incarnations, including a tinted version and one accompanied by music, the most compelling lingering image is neither the towers above nor the hellish factories below. It is the startling transformation of Ms. Helm from an  idealistic young woman into a barely clad creature performing a lascivious dance in a brothel.         The scene is, in a way, a reflection of Ms. Helm's own transformation.  While she was a woman of rectitude who never became anything close to the vamps she portrayed on the screen, according to most accounts she was a reluctant recruit  to the movies. The daughter of a Prussian Army officer who died when she was a toddler, Ms. Helm, a native of Berlin whose original name was Eva Gisela Schittenhelm, was a serious, idealistic boarding school student who appeared willingly enough in school plays but who regarded movie acting with Prussian disdain as an immoral occupation on its face.         Then her mother, who had no such notions, sent her daughter's photograph to Lang's wife, the screenwriter, Thea von Harbou, and Ms. Helm, who was 16 when she was tricked into taking a screen test, was suddenly on her way to stardom.         While he may not have been the sadist many of his actors made him out to be,  Lang was such a hard-driving perfectionist that Ms. Helm, who worked virtually every day for 18 months, often hanging upside down or standing in water up to her waist for hours at a time, found the experience excruciating.         After one torturous ordeal, when she wondered why a double could not have taken her place during the nine days it took to shoot a scene in which she is encased in a metallic robot shell, her face obscured, Lang haughtily claimed an  auteur's creative sensibility.         "I have to feel that you are inside the robot," he said. "I was able to see you even when I didn't."         After the movie made her a star, Ms. Helm, who had her own artistic standards, refused to make another movie with Lang.         She made a successful transition to sound, but refused to abandon Germany for Hollywood. Then in 1935, disgusted with the Nazi takeover of the film industry,  she abruptly quit, marrying an industrialist, Hugo von Kunheim, himself a Nazi opponent.         The couple left Germany for Italy in 1942, but although they returned after the war, Ms. Helm had put her career so far behind her she made no further films and turned down almost all requests for interviews.         Ms. Helm's survivors include a son, Mathius Kunheim of London, two other sons and a daughter.       
         Theodora Ayer Randolph, who rode the Virginia hunt country long enough and well enough to become known as the first lady of fox hunting, died on Tuesday at her Oakley Farm home in Upperville, Va. She was 90.         It had been years since Mrs. Randolph had donned her dark-blue, gold-collared coat, tucked her auburn hair under her helmet and galloped off over the vast expanse of farmland that makes up the grounds of the 150-year-old landowners' association known as the Piedmont Hunt. But as a master of the Piedmont, she had remained an indispensable presence in the affairs of the nation's oldest and largest fox-hunting entity.         In an area 45 miles west of Washington, where generations-old farms are sometimes acquired by city-bred newcomers unaccustomed to seeing a horde of horsemen thunder across their front yards in pursuit of a pack of hounds in pursuit of a fox, no respecter of property lines, after all, it would be Mrs. Randolph's duty to pay the newcomers a call. Over a cup of tea, perhaps, she would acquaint them with the customs and traditions of the neighborhood, assuring them that the members of the Piedmont Hunt were always careful to close gates they might have opened and to not trample any flower beds near the house.         As a clincher, she would note that as landowners, the newcomers would be eligible to join the Piedmont, an act that would instantly elevate them to the upper reaches of Virginia society.         The widow of Dr. Archibald Cary Randolph, a landed surgeon whose family helped settle Virginia, Mrs. Randolph succeeded her husband as hunt master after his death in 1959. But she was something of a newcomer herself. In an area where the first families of Virginia can be downright condescending to those who trace their ancestry to only the second wave of settlers, Mrs. Randolph achieved social prominence and fox-hunting distinction despite the fact that she was an actual Yankee.         Mrs. Randolph was born Sept. 27, 1905, in Beverly Farms, Mass., and learned to ride at the age of 3. Her father was master of the local Myopia Hunt, and she was fox hunting long before she saw Virginia.         Even so, she readily acknowledged that she received some of her most vivid training in advanced fence-jumping during Virginia visits to her daredevil uncle, General George S. Patton.         Mrs. Randolph -- whose first marriage, to the Massachusetts-born New York investment banker Robert Winthrop, ended in divorce -- married well twice and was born better.         Her father, Charles Ayer, was a member of the family that settled Ayer, Mass., and made a considerable fortune dealing in woolens and patent medicines,  including the 19th-century tonic rage, sarsaparilla.         After her divorce, Mrs. Randolph, who had fallen in love with the Virginia hunt country during her years at Foxcroft, a Virginia boarding school, settled there and renewed her acquaintance with Dr. Randolph, whom she had known as the  dashing master of the Piedmont Hunt during her boarding school days.         After their marriage in 1941, she became active in every aspect of equestrian affairs, breeding show and steeplechase champions, leading a drive to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and receiving numerous honors for her work, including an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.         But it was as a highly accomplished horsewoman, one who could take the lead in an organization that prides itself on being the nation's fastest hunt ("Keep  up or go home" is one of its official rules), that she won greatest acclaim.         It was a tribute to her standing, and her reputation for social observation,  that in her later years newcomers tended to come to her.         In an area of such sprawling acreage and long driveways that next-door neighbors tend to drive over when they visit, Mrs. Randolph lived next door to Paul Mellon, not that she could actually see the Pittsburgh banking heir's house from her own.         But she could see his private landing strip from her parlor window and took wry delight in the extravagant idiosyncrasies of the very wealthy. Whenever she  would see the Mellons's private plane land and then take off 10 minutes later, her step-granddaughter and farm manager, Becky Armstrong, recalled yesterday, Mrs. Randolph would take a sip of her tea and nod knowingly: It was only Mrs. Mellon, she would say, come home to fetch a scarf.         Mrs. Randolph is survived by three children from her first marriage, Theodora Hooton of Glen Head, N.Y., Amory Winthrop of Millbrook, N.Y., and Cornelia Bonnie of Prospect, Ky.; five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Ella Fitzgerald, whose sweet, silvery voice and endlessly inventive vocal improvisations made her the most celebrated jazz singer of her generation, died  yesterday at home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         She had been suffering from diabetes and its eyesight and circulatory system  complications for many years. In 1993, both of her legs were amputated below the knees.         A pre-eminent American singer who brought a classic sense of musical proportion and balance to everything she touched, Miss Fitzgerald won the sobriquet "first lady of song" and earned the unqualified admiration of most of  her peers. Musicians from Bing Crosby to Benny Goodman, when asked to name their favorite singer, cited Ella Fitzgerald.         "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest," Crosby once said. Mel Torme hailed her as having "the best ear of any singer ever." Until the 1970's, when physical problems began to impinge on her perfect technique, this hefty, unglamorous woman seemed to loom as an immutable creative force in a musical world where everything else was crumbling.         In a career that spanned six decades, Miss Fitzgerald stood above the emotional fray of the scores of popular standards she performed. Stylistically she was the polar opposite of her equally legendary peer, Billie Holiday, who conveyed a wounded vulnerability. Even when handed a sad song, Miss Fitzgerald communicated a wistful, sweet-natured compassion for the heartache she described.         Where Holiday and Frank Sinatra lived out the dramas they sang about, Miss Fitzgerald, viewing them from afar, seemed to understand and forgive all. Her apparent equanimity and her clear pronunciation, which transcended race, ethnicity, class and age, made her a voice of profound reassurance and hope.         Over the decades, Miss Fitzgerald performed with big bands, symphony orchestras and small jazz groups. Her repertory encompassed show tunes, jazz songs, novelties (like her first major hit, "A-Tisket A-Tasket," recorded in 1938), bossa nova, and even opera ("Porgy and Bess" excerpts, recorded with Louis Armstrong). At her jazziest, her material became a springboard for ever-changing, ebullient vocal inventions, delivered in a sweet, girlish voice that could leap, slide or growl anywhere within a range of nearly three octaves.         Great Diction And Vocal Agility         Miss Fitzgerald was renowned both for her delicately rendered ballads and her pyrotechnical displays of scat improvisation. (The jazz historian Barry Ulanov traced the term be-bop to her spontaneous interpolation of the word "re-bop" in  her 1939 recording of "T'Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It.") She was sometimes criticized for a lack of bluesiness and emotional depth. But her perfect intonation, vocal acrobatics, clear diction and endless store of melodic improvisations -- all driven by powerful rhythmic undercurrents -- brought her nearly universal acclaim.         During her long career, Miss Fitzgerald recorded with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong. Her series of "Songbook" albums, celebrating such songwriters as Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Duke Ellington, helped to elevate the work of the best American songwriters to a stature widely recognized as art song.         "I never knew how good our songs were," Ira Gershwin once said, "until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."         Although most biographies give her birth date as 1918, her birth certificate  and school records show her to have been born a year earlier, on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Va. She was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams Fitzgerald. The couple separated within a year of her birth, and with her mother and a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, she moved to Yonkers.         As a child, Miss Fitzgerald dreamed of being a dancer. But she also sang and  was attracted to the recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and the Boswell  Sisters, in particular the group's lead singer, Connee Boswell.         "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it," she  recalled many years later. "I tried so hard to sound just like her."         As a teen-ager, Miss Fitzgerald developed a dance routine with a friend, Charles Gulliver, which they performed in local clubs. Then in 1932, her mother  died suddenly, and she went to live with an aunt in Harlem.         On Nov. 21, 1934, she made her stage debut in an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater, singing two songs, "The Object of My Affection" and "Judy," in the style of Connee Boswell. She won first prize.         Around this time, she also caught the attention of Chick Webb, the band leader and drummer, who was reluctant to sign her to a contract because she was  gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough," as the band leader Mario Bauza later remembered. But the audience's reaction to her performances persuaded him  to offer her a job, and during the Webb band's residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem her reputation blossomed.         "I thought my singing was pretty much hollering," she recalled many years later, "but Webb didn't."         A Novelty Song Made Her a Star         Miss Fitzgerald made her first recording in 1935 ("Love and Kisses," with Chick Webb), and had her first hit with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," a song she helped  write, adapting the lyric, she later explained, from "that old drop-the-handkerchief game I played from 6 to 7 years old on up." The record became a popular sensation and made her a star. After Webb died in 1939, the young singer was the band's nominal leader until mid-1942, when it broke up. Between her recording debut in 1935 and the demise of the band seven years later, Miss Fitzgerald recorded almost 150 sides, the majority of them novelties and disposable pop fluff.         During this period, she married Benjamin Kornegay, a shipyard worker and petty thief with a criminal record. The marriage ended in annulment after two years. The singer was 30 when she fell in love with the bassist Ray Brown while  they were on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band. They were married in December 1947, set up housekeeping in East Elmhurst, Queens, and adopted the son of Miss  Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named the boy Ray Jr. While Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on her career, her son was cared for by her aunt Virginia.         The marriage eventually became a casualty of conflicting career schedules, and the couple were divorced in 1953, although they continued to work together.  In 1957, there were reports in the Scandinavian press that she had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a Norwegian impresario. Miss Fitzgerald is survived by Ray Brown Jr. and a grandchild.         As early as 1942 and 43, Miss Fitzgerald began to be influenced by the experiments of such be-bop instrumentalists as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. She incorporated elements of be-bop rhythm and harmony into her singing, and while on tour with the Gillespie band in 1946 she embraced the music wholeheartedly.         A year earlier, she had recorded what would become one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade, a version of "Flying Home" in which she indulged extensively in the phonetic improvisation known as scat. Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.         Two years later, when Decca released her sensational be-bop version of "Lady  Be Good," Downbeat magazine proclaimed her "as great a master of bop as she has  been of swing."         These achievements were among the high points of a recording career that found Miss Fitzgerald recording in all manner of pop settings. Between 1935 and  1955 she recorded for Decca Records. Under the commercially astute supervision of the producer Milt Gabler, she was teamed with the vocal group the Ink Spots for several hits, including the million-selling "I'm Making Believe" and "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." She also scored commercially with novelty duets  recorded with Louis Jordan, the most popular of which was "Stone Cold Dead in the Market."         A Huge Change Of Direction         Dictated largely by the fads of the moment, Miss Fitzgerald's pre-1955 pop recording career was an artistically mixed bag and stood distinct from her work  as a swing and jazz singer in nightclubs. One of the artistic high points of the Decca years was a 10-inch long-playing record, "Ella Sings Gershwin," which she  recorded with the pianist Ellis Larkins in 1950.         Miss Fitzgerald's life changed when Norman Granz, the impresario of the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, invited her to join the touring jam sessions in 1949 and later became her manager. One of her most popular numbers,  "How High the Moon," evolved into the unofficial signature tune of the series.         Their relationship quickly developed into one of the most productive artist-manager partnerships in the history of jazz. When Miss Fitzgerald's contract with Decca expired, she became the first artist Mr. Granz signed to his new Verve label. It was under his supervision that she undertook the series of landmark "Songbook" albums that brought her voice to a large nonjazz audience.         "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop," she later recalled. "I thought be-bop was 'it,' and that all I had to do was go someplace  and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman came along, and he felt that I should do other things, so he produced 'The Cole Porter Songbook' with me. It was a turning point in my life."         "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook" became the prototype for a series of anthologies recorded over more than a decade and focusing on individual composers or composing teams, blending familiar standards and lesser-known, usually first-rate songs.         Backed by various studio orchestras, she also interpreted the work of Irving  Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer  and Rodgers and Hart. "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook," a 53-song, 5-LP collection recorded with the arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle in 1959, is widely regarded as the greatest of the collections.         These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing  the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.         From 1956 through the mid-1960's, Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on material that was almost consistently commensurate with her artistry, and her career soared. She made her first feature-film appearance in "Pete Kelly's Blues," in 1955, and in 1957 presented her own concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In April 1958 she gave a Carnegie Hall concert with Duke Ellington to celebrate the release of her four-disk set, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook."         A workhorse who toured from 40 to 45 weeks of each year, Miss Fitzgerald showed the first signs of fatigue when she nearly collapsed on the stage during a concert in Munich in 1965. Five years earlier, Mr. Granz had sold Verve records to MGM, and when her contract came up for renewal in 1966, she was not re-signed to the label, but Mr. Granz moved her to Capitol, where her producer,  Dave Dexter, promised to give her "a totally different sound." These albums, which included a religious record, an album of country music and a Christmas collection, found her groping insecurely for a new pop identity.         Signed briefly to Reprise Records, Miss Fitzgerald tried singing contemporary hits by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Marvin Gaye, but rock and soul proved almost as uncongenial to her style as had country.         Basie, Sinatra And Symphonies         She returned to jazz full time when Mr. Granz founded his label Pablo in 1973. Among her many Pablo recordings are four duet albums with the guitarist Joe Pass, made from 1973 to 1986, and another songbook album devoted to the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She also began performing regularly with symphony orchestras, and in 1974 she teamed with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie for a two-week concert engagement at the Uris Theater in New York that grossed more than a million dollars.         From the early 1970's, Miss Fitzgerald began to have eyesight problems complicated by diabetes, and in 1986 she had heart surgery, but she returned to  the concert stage the next year. Despite ill health, she continued to perform at least once month into the early 1990's. Although her quality of voice slowly deteriorated from the early 1970's, even at the end of her career, her singing retained a remarkable rhythmic acuity.         Offstage, Miss Fitzgerald lived a quiet, self-protective life in a 13-room house in Beverly Hills. Her social life involved a small circle of old friends,  including members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras, and other singers, including over the years Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.         A model of abstemious self-discipline, she shunned cigarettes and liquor. She was also a person of few words. Shy and extremely sensitive to criticism, she preferred to let Mr. Granz do most of the talking for her.         Asked once how she felt about being "a legend," she replied: "I don't think I noticed it at first. But when Norman Granz and I began recording the 'Songbook'  series in the mid-50's, it just seemed that more people began to like my singing. The awards I started winning didn't make me feel important, but they made me realize people loved me. And then kids started calling me 'Ella' -- half of them never even mentioned 'Ella Fitzgerald' -- just 'Ella.' "         She amassed countless awards and commendations, including honorary doctorates at Yale and Dartmouth, the National Medal of Arts, and 13 Grammy Awards, including one in 1967 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1979 she was given a Kennedy  Center Award for her lifetime in the performing arts.         Accepting an honorary doctorate of music at Yale, she commented with her characteristic modesty, "Not bad for someone who only studied music to get that  half-credit in high school."         Fitzgerald for Home Listening         Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most prolific recording artists in jazz. These are some of her best albums:         "Ella Fitzgerald: 75th-Birthday Celebration" (Decca Jazz). A two-disk, 39-song collection, it includes the cream of the singer's pop output recorded for Decca between 1938 and 1955.         "Pure Ella" (Decca Jazz). These 20 songs recorded in the 1950's with the pianist Ellis Larkins exemplify elegant simplicity and ideal teamwork.         "Ella and Louis" (Verve). In this 1956 collaboration with Louis Armstrong, two titans meet playfully.         "Like Someone in Love" (Verve). This lush collection of 19 ballads recorded in 1957 with Frank DeVol's orchestra is her most romantic album.         "Mack the Knife: The Complete Ella in Berlin" (Verve). This classic live album was recorded in 1960 when the singer was at the height of her powers.         "The Intimate Ella" (Verve). Originally released in 1960 under the title "Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From the Soundtrack of 'Let No Man Write My Epitaph,' " the collection of 13 ballads recorded with the pianist Paul Smith is a neglected masterpiece.         "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks" (Verve). Taken together, these 16 disks, recorded between 1956 and 1964, constitute the singer's crowning achievement. The tributes to Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer can also be purchased individually. Although the Cole Porter collection,  which was the first, is the most famous, it is not the best. The 53-song Gershwin album, recorded with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, is the artistic peak.         "Ella and Basie: On the Sunny Side of the Street" (Verve). A swinging powerhouse, released in 1963.         "Fitzgerald and Pass . . . Again" (Pablo). The best joint recording by two beautifully matched jazz classicists.         "Fine and Mellow" (Pablo). A wonderful swinging album from 1974, recorded with an all-star small ensemble.         Correction:  June 20, 1996, Thursday         An obituary on Sunday about Ella Fitzgerald misidentified the first feature film in which she appeared. It was "Ride 'Em Cowboy" in 1942, not "Pete Kelly's  Blues" in 1955.       
         Kathy Ahern, a former child prodigy of a golfer who turned professional while still a teen-ager, died on Saturday at her home in Phoenix. She was 47.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, family members said.         Ms. Ahern won three tournaments during her career on the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, including the 1972 L.P.G.A. Championship, one of the tour's four major championships. She also won the 1970 Southgate Open and the 1972 George Washington Classic.         An accomplished amateur who won the 1964 Texas Public Links Championship at the age of 15, Ms. Ahern was just 17 years old when she joined the L.P.G.A. Tour after her senior year in high school in 1967. As a senior in Dallas, she also won the Texas Amateur and the Texas Junior and was runner-up in the United States Golf Association Junior Amateur.         Before a series of injuries interrupted her playing career in the late 1970's, Ms. Ahern was regularly a factor on the tour. A good ball striker with an excellent short game, she was the runner-up in the 1971 L.P.G.A. Championship, and then won the tournament the next year at Pleasant Valley Country Club.         Although she competed rarely throughout the 1980's, Ms. Ahern remained in touch with the L.P.G.A., sometimes assisting and coaching players, or caddying on tour for her close friend, Sherri Turner.         In May of 1991, it was diagnosed that Ms. Ahern had breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy and a series of radiation treatments. The cancer metastasized in 1993, but Ms. Ahern remained an active supporter of the L.P.G.A., attending a tournament as recently as the first week in June.         "Kathy's courage and determination in the face of her illness is an inspiration to us all," L.P.G.A. Commissioner Jim Ritts said. "She was never deterred from showing her love of the L.P.G.A., her family and friends while she was making a lasting impact on the lives of many."         She is survived by her mother, Kay Ahern, and several sisters.       
         Faithful followers of soap operas have learned over the years that after a brief and bitter first marriage a young single mother can find love, marriage and singular professional success with a much older man, but now the question is:         Can a career woman who sacrificed her leisure to keep a nation of enthralled  housewives glued to their radios for the better part of two decades survive a heart-wrenching regimen of producing as many as 90 cliff-hanging episodes a week to live a full, rich and long life?         No need to stay tuned or wait for a toothpaste commercial. It can now be revealed that when she died in bed at her Fifth Avenue apartment on July 5, Anne Hummert, the woman widely credited with creating the radio soap opera and spinning out many of the classics of the 1930's and 40's, was a 91-year-old multimillionaire who had maintained a vigorous life almost to the end.         At a time when televised soap operas have become a postfeminist cultural sideshow, it is hard to imagine the era when "Stella Dallas," "Helen Trent," "Ma Perkins" and "Lorenzo Jones" were more than household names, and when virtually  every woman in America knew that Mary Noble was the "Backstage Wife" and were familiar with every detail of the anguished but inspiring lives of "John's Other Wife" and "Young Widow Brown."         It is even harder to imagine that all of these plus more than a dozen others  were the creations of a diminutive dynamo from Baltimore and the man she kept at bay for seven years after taking a job as his assistant at a Chicago advertising agency.         By the time she met E. Frank Hummert in 1927, the former Anne Schumacher had  lived something of a soap opera herself. A brilliant student who graduated magna cum laude from Goucher College at age 20 in 1925, she had begun her career as a  college correspondent for The Sun, then worked as a Sun reporter before going to Paris in 1926.         She became a reporter for the precursor of The International Herald Tribune her first day in the city, but within a year she had married and divorced a fellow reporter, John Ashenhurst, and was back in the United States with an infant son.         Settling in Chicago, she failed to get a newspaper job but became an assistant to Mr. Hummert, a former St. Louis newspaperman who had become a renowned copywriter and a partner in the Chicago agency Blackett, Sample & Hummert.         He was some two decades older than she and a confirmed bachelor, but then he  had never met a woman quite like his captivating 22-year-old assistant with the  tinkling voice, who was such a fount of ideas and organized efficiency that she became a vice president just two years later.         She, on the other hand, had already been married to one newspaperman, thank you, and was in no hurry to marry another. The couple didn't marry until 1934, when they began what friends recall as one of the great love matches, which lasted until Mr. Hummert's death in 1966.         At a time when commercial programming in the infant medium concentrated on working people who returned home to sit in front of their radios at night, advertisers were dimly aware that the housewives who stayed home all day were the nation's primary purchasing agents. But these women were considered too busy to pay more than cursory attention to the family radio.         The Hummerts didn't argue with the theory of the distracted housewife. They simply seized her attention and changed the pattern of her life. After "Just Plain Bill" hit the daytime airwaves in 1933, housewives arranged their work so  they would never miss an episode of the small-town barber who married above himself.         Although a short-lived 1930 program, "Painted Lives" by Irna Phillips, is regarded as the first radio soap opera, it was "Just Plain Bill," which began at night in 1932, that created the cultural juggernaut that would eventually be  nicknamed for the product that often sponsored it.         Within months the show had spawned many copycats, few as successful as those  turned out by the Hummerts themselves, who had as many as 18 separate 15-minute  serials running at a time for a total of 90 episodes a week, each ending with an unresolved crisis that was heightened for the Friday episode.         The couple, who formed their own company, Hummert Productions, and moved to New York in the mid-1930's, farmed out the writing after they had dreamed up the original idea and mapped out the initial story line. But they were deeply involved in every aspect of each production, from casting to script editing.         Mrs. Hummert, who had a photographic memory, was renowned in the industry for her ability to remember each intricate twist of every one of their creations.         It was a reflection of the grip the Hummerts had on their audience that their programs generated more than five million letters a year, and it was a measure of their commercial success that by 1939 Hummert programs accounted for more than half the advertising revenues generated by daytime radio.         The Hummerts were also well rewarded. At a time when the average doctor made  less than $5,000 a year and the average lawyer half that, they were each making  $100,000 a year from their enterprise, which included several evening musical programs, like "Waltz Time," and mysteries, including the haunting "Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons."         When television began to displace radio, the couple simply retired and enjoyed a well-traveled life of leisure. After her husband's death, Mrs. Hummert gave up their Park Avenue triplex and cut down a bit on her travels, but she continued her active life, which until a few months ago included daily three-mile walks.         Mrs. Hummert, whose son died several years ago, is survived by two granddaughters, Pamela Pigoni of Hinckley, Ill., and Anne Jeskey of Park Ridge,  Ill., and two great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Mitford, whose book "The American Way of Death" won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist, died yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Constancia Romilly.         Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction, Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War, against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing, and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures. She even  exposed the odd doings of her sisters.         But it was "The American Way of Death," published in 1963, that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country. Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred  A. Knopf.         The thesis of the book, a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry, was that undertakers had "successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge, macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public."         She explored the changing lexicon of death, in which undertakers had come to  call themselves "funeral directors" and "morticians," coffins had become "caskets," and hearses had become "professional cars." In the new order, she said, flowers were "floral tributes" and corpses were always called "loved ones." One of the results of all this, she said, was that the cost of dying was  rising faster than was the cost of living.         She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers,  much to the dismay of the trade, and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body. She felt strongly that someone's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals.         The New Yorker hailed the book as a "brilliant journalistic case against the  whole funeral industry," and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. But not everyone was pleased. James B. Utt, then a Republican  Congressman from California, a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries, denounced Miss Mitford as "pro-Communist, anti-American." Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book "no doubt will find their way into  the coffers of the Communist Party, U.S.A." Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940's, an experience chronicled in her memoirs, but had quit the party.         Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11, 1917, at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire, England, one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale (David Mitford) and Lady Redesdale, the former Sydney Bowles.         It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity. One of Miss Mitford's five sisters, Pamela, aspired as a child to be a horse. Another, Diana, wanted to be a Fascist and succeeded in becoming the wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, the ranking leader of Britain's Fascists. Another daughter, Unity, went to Germany,  became a disciple of Hitler, shot herself and died nine years later in a nursing home.         Miss Mitford's eldest sister, Nancy, became a novelist, and is best remembered for "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate."         Miss Mitford described her childhood as largely unhappy. She particularly resented that she and her sisters were prevented from going to school because Lady Redesdale did not believe that girls needed it and tutored them at home.         Early in life, Miss Mitford shared a sitting room with her sister Unity, who  adorned it with swastikas. According to her memoirs, Miss Mitford responded by using a diamond ring to carve small hammers and sickles into the windowpanes on her side of the room.         When she was 19, she ran away from home with a second cousin, Esmond Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill. Because she eloped, she was cut out of her father's will. In 1939, Miss Mitford quit her job as a market researcher in the  London office of J. Walter Thompson and moved to the United States with her husband. He joined the Canadian Air Force after the war broke out and was killed in action in 1941.         Miss Mitford was a union organizer, a bartender at a Miami restaurant, a clerk in a Washington dress shop and a typist and later an investigator at the Office of Price Administration in World War II.         In 1943, she married Robert E. Treuhaft, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and the couple moved to Oakland, Calif. When Miss Mitford was 38, she decided that she would become a writer. She had largely failed at her other jobs, she wrote, and  "I figured that the only thing that requires no education and no skills is writing."         She produced her first book, "Life itselfmanship," in 1956. It was privately  published and had little circulation. Her second effort, "Daughters and Rebels," an autobiography, was published in 1960 and won praise from the critics. Her next book was "The American Way of Death," which remained on the best-seller list for a year.         Late in life, she was asked what sort of funeral she wanted. An elaborate one, she replied, with "six black horses with plumes and one of those marvelous  jobs of embalming that take 20 years off." She added that she wanted "streets to be blocked off, dignitaries to declaim sobbingly over the flower-smothered bier, proclamations to be issued -- that sort of thing."         Her other books attracted much attention, although none as much as "The American Way of Death." She also wrote "The Trial of Dr. Spock, William Sloan Coffin Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin" (1969), five who were accused of aiding and abetting those who sought to violate the Selective Service Act. Among her other books were "Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business" (1973), a study of American prisons, which she found wanting in almost everything except brutality; "A Fine Old Conflict" (1977), a memoir of her Communist days; "Poison Penmanship: The Gentle Art of Muckraking" (1979), and "The American Way of Birth" (1992), in which she accused doctors of doing too many Caesarean sections and of not paying enough attention to the possibilities  offered by midwifery.         She also wrote articles for Life, Esquire, The Nation and The San Francisco Chronicle.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; a  son, Benjamin Treuhaft of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Deborah Devonshire of Chatsworth, England, and Diana Mosley of Paris, and three grandchildren.         Correction:         An obituary of the writer Jessica Mitford on Wednesday omitted the titles of  her surviving sisters and misidentified the hometown of one. One sister is Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire. Her hometown is Bakewell, in Darbyshire; Chatsworth is the name of her house. The other sister is Lady Diana Mosley.         An obituary on July 24 about the writer Jessica Mitford misstated the relative ages of her and her sisters. Ms. Mitford was the second youngest of six daughters. Her sister Deborah was the youngest.       
         Claudette Colbert, the versatile stage and film star whose flair for light comedy cheered audiences during the Depression and for decades afterward, died yesterday at Belle-rive, her home on the island of Barbados. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Miss Colbert's wit, gaiety, cupid's-bow mouth and light touch took her from the Art Students League in New York to the height of stardom on Broadway and in  Hollywood. She is best remembered for screwball comedies in which, no matter what situation befell her, she usually managed to keep her aplomb and good humor. Her greatest triumph was playing a runaway heiress opposite Clark Gable's cynical reporter in Frank Capra's film comedy "It Happened One Night," a performance that won her an Academy Award as best actress in 1934.         She could appear worldly and sophisticated yet down to earth, a quality that, combined with attention to camera angles, lighting and other technical details, helped her to sustain a remarkably durable career encompassing more than 60 films and many stage appearances.         In 1981, in her seventh decade in show business, the New York Times critic Frank Rich, praising her performance in the Broadway flop "A Talent for Murder," called her "a lady of piquant, irrepressible, ever-so-amusing common sense." He  cited "her big Betty Boop eyes, curly light hair" and "her low, one-of-the-boys  voice, effortlessly hurling asides like pool balls into every pocket of the house."         "Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them," Miss Colbert told an interviewer in 1978. "If they want you, you want to do it. The feeling never dies."         From 'The Lady Lies' To the Milk of Asses         Miss Colbert had her first film success in 1929, as the heroine of the talkie "The Lady Lies." Her early notable films, all box-office hits, included "The Smiling Lieutenant" (1931), a wistful Ernst Lubitsch comedy; "The Sign of the Cross," a 1932 Cecil B. DeMille spectacular in which she played Nero's sensuous  empress Poppaea, and the 1934 production of "Cleopatra," in which she played the title role.         "The Sign of the Cross" included a memorable scene with Miss Colbert bathing  in what was described by the studio as asses' milk, a scene that became widely admired. The film historian David Thomson wrote six decades later that Miss Colbert had bathed not only in asses' milk but also in "the director's boyish lasciviousness."         Miss Colbert confided in a 1984 interview that the asses' milk was really made from a powdered product called Klim.         "That's 'milk' spelled backward," the star explained. "I was in the pool all  day. The Klim was so warm my bangs came uncurled. When the electricians turned off all the hot lights for an hour it congealed and the Klim turned to cream cheese."         Besides DeMille, directors of her films included George Cukor, John Ford, Gregory LaCava, Mervyn LeRoy and Anatole Litvak. Among her leading men were Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Joseph Cotten, Melvyn Douglas, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Fredric March, Ray Milland, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne and Orson Welles.         Her early films were followed by such successes as "Imitation of Life" (1934); "The Gilded Lily" (1935); "Private Worlds" (1935), a drama of a mental institution; "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife" (1938), another Lubitsch comedy; "Midnight" (1939); "The Palm Beach Story" (1942), a Preston Sturges caper, and "Since You Went Away" (1944), a drama of the American home front during World War II.         Her last artistically substantial movie role was as a married American woman  in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in "Three Came Home" (1950). Her performance  was warmly praised by the critics, but the film did not fare well at the box office.         Through much of her movie career she was under contract to Paramount, although she was on loan to Columbia when she made "It Happened One Night." After 1950 her movie roles were largely vignettes. She made her last feature film, "Parrish," in 1961 but went before the cameras again in 1986 for a television movie, "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles."         Miss Colbert's most noteworthy stage vehicles included "The Barker" (1927), a box-office hit in which she played an alluring snake charmer; Eugene O'Neill's "Dynamo," which was produced by the Theater Guild in 1929 and won her considerable prestige, although it was not a popular success, and the fluffy comedy "The Marriage-Go-Round," a smash hit that opened in 1958 co-starring Charles Boyer, with whom she had also appeared in such films as "Private Worlds" (1935) and "Tovarich" (1937).         An important ingredient in her early success in the theater was her skill asa speaker. When talking films took hold and many silent-film stars turned out to have inadequate voices, she was taken on by Paramount.         "Hollywood was not my dream, you know," she said in an interview in 1978. "I  only left Broadway when the crash came. The Depression killed the theater, and the pictures were manna from heaven."         For many years, Miss Colbert was among the top-earning movie stars: some industry analysts calculated that she was the industry's best-paid star in 1938  and 1942. That made it even easier for her to clothe her 5-foot-4-inch frame ultra-fashionably, and for several years she was voted Hollywood's best-dressed  woman.         Despite her long identification with Hollywood, Miss Colbert's dramatic skills were versatile enough that she was among the few major film stars who managed repeatedly to return to the stage to critical acclaim.         Triumphant Returns To the Theater         Her first return to Broadway, after more than a quarter-century and the cooling of her movie career, came in the spring of 1956, when she replaced Margaret Sullavan during the spring and summer in the comedy "Janus." Appearances in other Broadway productions followed, including "The Marriage-Go-Round," and in 1963 she announced that she was bidding farewell to Hollywood for good.         Miss Colbert was born in Paris on Sept. 13, 1903, and was brought to this country as a child by her parents, Georges and Jeanne Loew Chauchoin. Her name was originally Lily Claudette Chauchoin. But she took the name Claudette Colbert (pronounced coal-BEAR) for her first Broadway role, an opening that resulted from an introduction to the playwright Anne Morrison at a tea party in New York  in 1923. Miss Colbert, who was studying at the Art Students League, jokingly suggested that Morrison give her a role in her next play. Morrison gave her a small one in "The Wild Westcotts."         "I just went right onstage, and I learned by watching," Miss Colbert said years later, noting that she had never taken acting lessons. "I've always believed that acting is instinct to start with; you either have it or you don't."         Broadway fame came quickly. In 1927 the young Leland Hayward, who would become a celebrated theatrical producer, told the director Frank Capra that Miss Colbert was "a real headline maker, the finest young actress that's hit Broadway in years."         Mr. Capra was soon directing the silent movie "For the Love of Mike," with Mr. Hayward in overall charge of production and Miss Colbert in the leading female role.         The movie, nade on a shoestring, was a flop. In his 1971 book "The Name Above the Title," Mr. Capra wrote that Miss Colbert, "never easily pleased, said that  for her it was a disaster, and vowed that it would be her first and last film."         Although she changed her mind, Miss Colbert was far from Mr. Capra's first choice for the female lead when he began preparing "It Happened One Night." First he approached Myrna Loy, who turned the part down. So did Margaret Sullavan. So did Miriam Hopkins. So did Constance Bennett.         Finally Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, suggested Miss Colbert, who grudgingly took on the role. When the movie was being made, Mr. Capra reported, Miss Colbert proved to be firm yet engaging. For one intimate scene, he said: "Claudette refused to even partially undress before the camera. She wanted to feature her acting, not her sex appeal."         By the same token, she refused at first to raise her skirt for the subsequently famous hitchhiking scene, in which the script called for her to demonstrate that a display of leg could stop a motorist.         And so, Mr. Capra recalled: "We waited until the casting director sent us a chorus girl with shapely underpinnings to 'double' for Colbert's. When she saw the double's leg, she said: 'Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!' "         During the filming, Mr. Capra asserted, Miss Colbert had "many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me," but "she was wonderful in the part." Later it was said that she told friends, "I've just finished the worst picture in the world."         When Oscar time rolled around, the film won the five top awards: best picture, best writer, best director, best actor and best actress.         When the Oscar was placed in her hands Miss Colbert said, "I owe Frank Capra  for this."         In later years Miss Colbert also appeared frequently on television, and in that medium, too, it was said that despite her talent she could be difficult. Noel Coward, who worked with her in 1956 on the live telecast of his comedy "Blithe Spirit," recorded in his diary that he found her "extremely tiresome."         "All this is a sad pity," he wrote, "because she is, within her limits, an excellent actress and those limits she imposes on herself.I have for years had a definite affection for her as a person, but these rehearsals are wilting it considerably."         Miss Colbert, who was short-necked, liked to tell of a Coward comment during  those rehearsals: "If she had a neck, I'd wring it." Miss Colbert said the comment had hurt at the time, but agreed that it was funny. She and Coward made  up a year later.         Miss Colbert drew praise for her acting, into her 80's. She co-starred on Broadway with Rex Harrison in "The Kingfisher" in 1981 and shared top billing with him again in the 1985 Broadway revival of "Aren't We All?," a 1923 drawing-room comedy by Frederick Lonsdale that took them to Australia for a five-month tour after runs in London, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Mr. Rich of The Times called her the play's "most alluring attraction" and "simply a wonder" as the tea-sipping Lady Frinton.         Always Appreciative Of Her Film Genre         In 1984, a building at the Kaufman Astoria studios in Queens, where she made  her first 10 films for Paramount, was named after her, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center paid tribute to her lifetime achievement with a gala in her honor. She was also honored by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1989.         For years, Miss Colbert spent six months annually at her beachfront estate in Barbados, where her guests included Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra and Ronald and Nancy Reagan. She remained on Barbados after her stroke three years ago.         In 1928, Miss Colbert married Norman Foster, an actor and director who was appearing with her in "The Barker." They were divorced in 1935, and in December  of that year she married Dr. Joel Pressman; he died in 1968, and she leaves no immediate family members.         Miss Colbert never looked down on the material she was best at. The film studios liked her to do comedy, she once said, "because they made a lot of money off me." But she added: "I did the comedy because all my life I always wanted to laugh myself. There was never anything that gave me as much satisfaction as to be in something amusing."         Emancipated, With a Light Touch         During a career that began in the 1920's and lasted into the 1980's, Claudette Colbert starred in more than 60 films and in plays on Broadway and in  London. These are some of the works in which she appeared.

         Pamela Mason, an author, actress, talk-show host and former wife of the actor James Mason, died on Saturday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Pamela Helen Mason was born in Southend-on-Sea, England, the daughter of Isadore and Helen Ostrer. Her father was a mill owner and was also in the movie business. Mrs. Mason said that part of her later success was that she left school at age 9; education, she said, only confuses the mind.         She was 16 when she married Roy Kellino, a cinematographer. A young actor named James Mason came to stay with the couple, and they began collaborating on  a film, "I Met a Murderer." She fell in love with Mr. Mason and married him in 1940, after divorcing Mr. Kellino.         The Masons and their 12 cats moved to Hollywood in 1946, and Mr. Mason went on to make his career as the smooth-voiced leading man in such films as "Lolita" and "A Star Is Born."         The two were a contrast in styles. He was quiet to the point of dourness while Mrs. Mason would begin her day by telephoning Hollywood friends for the latest news. The writer Nora Ephron said the talkative Mrs. Mason had been "vaccinated with a phonograph needle."         The Masons acted on Broadway in "Bathsheba" in 1947, and during the 1950's they appeared together on the "James Mason Show," on television. They were divorced in 1964. Mrs. Mason was represented by the well-known divorce attorney  Marvin Mitchelson, and one of the terms of her settlement was $1 million in community property. The settlement, Mr. Mason is said to have remarked, was one  reason he was forced to make so many bad movies.         Mrs. Mason had two syndicated talk shows on television during the 1960's, "The Pamela Mason Show" and "The Weaker (?) Sex."         Among her books were "Marriage Is the First Step Toward Divorce" and "The Female Pleasure Hunt," which advised women on every subject from love to putting on makeup to buying a house.         She continued to have roles in films, including the 1985 television movie "My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn."         She is survived by her two children with Mr. Mason: a daughter, Portland, and a son, Morgan.       
         Phyllis Pearsall, who created the famous ''A to Z'' maps of London by traversing more than 3,000 miles of roads throughout the city, died on Wednesday, her business, Geographers' A-Z Map Company, said today. She was 89 years old and lived in Shoreham, England.         Mrs. Pearsall began producing her maps, which show London's labyrinth of streets from the busiest thoroughfares to the tiniest cul-de-sacs, after getting lost using a map that was 17 years old but proved to be the most up-to-date available. To get her first edition right, she often walked for 18 hours a day, rising at 5 A.M. and eventually covering some 23,000 roads.         In 1936 Mrs. Pearsall printed  10,000 copies of her maps, selling them as indefatigably as she had compiled them. She persuaded a reluctant buyer at W. H. Smith, the British bookseller, to place an order for 250 copies, promising a refund if they went unsold.         The maps were an instant success, and have sold countless millions of copies since, the favorite of visitors and Londoners alike, including the cab drivers and others whose job it is to make their way around the city.         Phyllis Isobel Gross was born in 1906, the daughter of an Irish-Italian mother and a Hungarian mapmaker. She was sent to Roedean, a fashionable girls' boarding school, but was forced to leave at age 14 when her father went bankrupt and fled to the United States. When she returned home, she said once in an interview, the door was answered by the fully  decked-out Maharajah of Patiala, who was in the midst of having his portrait painted by Alfred Orr, Phyllis's mother's lover.         ''Then mother said: 'Alfred has an artistic temperament and couldn't possibly have a little girl in the house. Get a live-in job,' '' Mrs. Pearsall related.         So Phyllis moved to Paris, where she taught English, studied philosophy and Byzantine art, and made money by painting. When she was 21, she married a 38-year-old artist and moved to Spain. After eight years  she left him because, she said, ''he was always angry and frightened.'' The couple had no children.         Returning to London and enlisting the help of her father's draftsman, Mrs. Pearsall founded the Geographer's A-Z Map Company and went to work. It wasn't easy, she said. ''I would go down one street, find three more and have no idea where I was.''         In 1965 Mrs. Pearsall turned the company into a trust to protect it from hostile takeovers. She also set up a trustee company to hold all the shares for staff members, giving up pension and dividend rights for herself, but continuing as chairman and joint managing dirctor.         Mrs. Pearsall suffered a stroke and fractured her spine and skull in a plane crash in the Netherlands in 1946, but she remained active until very late in life. She reported to work well into her 80's, arriving in a red Mercedes that she had been allowed to drive only since the age of 59, when she passed her driving test after more than 200 lessons.         Her London map business grew to include maps of all sizes, maps of other British cities, and road atlases, but Mrs. Pearsall always said that her real love was painting. In 1986 the Royal Geographical Society held an exhibition of her drawings, paintings and etchings.         Mrs. Pearsall wrote several books, including an account of her trips through Spain, a collection of short stories, a company history and a volume describing her business philosophy, in which she advocated generosity (''bonuses to everyone''), courtesy (''no aggressive selling'') and frugality (''Micawber housekeeping''). In 1986 she was made a Member of the British Empire.         Asked once by an interviewer if the doyenne of maps still got lost, she replied, ''Always, dear.''       
         Joanne Dru, who starred opposite John Wayne in the westerns ''Red River'' and ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' died on Tuesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was a respiratory illness, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Dru was born in Logan, W. Va. When her father died, she moved to New York with her mother and found work as a model for the Powers agency while still a teen-ager, changing her last name from LaCock to Marshall. She danced in the chorus of ''Hold Onto Your Hats,'' Al Jolson's last Broadway show, before marrying the crooner Dick Haymes, who took her to Hollywood when he was signed for film roles.         In Hollywood, she caught the eye of the director Howard Hawks, who changed her last name to Dru. After making her screen debut in ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in 1946, she was given the role of Tess Millay in Hawks's classic western ''Red River'' (1948). In the film she makes a memorable entrance, pinned to a wagon by an arrow during an Indian attack, a crisis that is solved by Montgomery Clift.         A year later, John Ford directed her in ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' in which, as Olivia Dandridge, she turned the heads of the United States  Cavalry. After appearing in ''All the King's Men'' (1949), she teamed up with Ford again for ''Wagon Master,'' starring opposite Ben Johnson.         In the 1950's, she made many films for 20th Century Fox, including ''711 Ocean Drive,'' ''Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell,'' ''The Pride of St. Louis,'', ''Thunder Bay,'' ''Hell on Frisco Bay.'' Most were a cut or two below the films she had made just a few years earlier. In ''Sincerely Yours,'' she played Liberace's love interest, and in ''Three Ring Circus,'' a Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis film, she was cast as Martin's girlfriend.         In ''Guestward Ho!,'' a television sitcom that ran from 1960 to 1961, she played Babs Hooten, a New Yorker transplanted to a rundown dude ranch in New Mexico.         She was married three times. Her second marriage, to the actor John Ireland, whom she met on the set of ''Red River,'' ended in divorce. Her last marriage was to C. V. Wood, a businessman.         She is survived by her children,  Richard Haymes Jr. of New York City and Helen Joanna Santos of Monterey, Calif. (a daughter, Barbara Nugent Haymes, died three years ago); six grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and her brothers, Peter Marshall, the television game-show host, and David Moss of Sedona, Ariz.       
         Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.         Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack.         The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.         The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.         ''We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay,'' she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: ''We stayed 19 years.''         By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.         Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.         How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.         Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.         In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.         Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.         Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.         But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called ''catalytic philanthropy,'' investments designed to bolster the state's economy.         In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.         What made such ''philanthropy,'' especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.         During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.         Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.         Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.         For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.         Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.         Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.         Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative ''catalytic philanthropy,'' that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.         In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.         Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Annabella, a film star with flashing eyes who became the toast of France in the 1930's, died on Wednesday at her home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Jose Sourillan, according to The Associated Press.         Annabella, whose real name was Suzanne Georgette Charpentier, was the daughter of a French publisher. She rose to celebrity when she starred in two films directed by Rene Clair: ''Le Million'' (1931), about hunting for a lost lottery ticket, and ''Quatorze Juillet,'' or ''July 14th'' (1933), about the adventures of a flower girl and a cab driver. They are still widely regarded as her finest work.         Her skill at playing the gamine became known in the United States, where The New York American commented in 1937: ''Among screen types she is like a fresh breeze among too many orchidaceous blooms. Her eyes are frank, her forehead high and her mouth childishly quizzical.''         She moved on to Hollywood and starred in a down-to-earth role opposite Tyrone Power when he played the canal builder in ''Suez'' (1938). Later that year, when her plans to divorce the French actor Jean Murat drew wide attention, she was quoted in The New York Mirror as saying: ''It is not always good to be a film star in America. It is like being a goldfish in a bowl. They must know what I eat, what I think, they even want to know whom I love -- and that I tell no one.''         In 1939 she married Power. She appeared in four other American films and in 1942 became an American citizen. But Annabella achieved only minor success in her adopted country. She returned to France for good after a divorce in 1948 from Power, who went on to marry the actress Linda Christian.         Back in Europe, Annabella failed to regain her earlier acclaim. Her last film was ''Le Plus Bel Amour de Don Juan'' (1952).         In her teens she started out as a dancer. She made her first screen appearance, at 16, under the name Annabella, in a minor role in the epic-length silent film ''Napoleon'' (1926), with Abel Gance as director and screenwriter. Other minor film parts followed, until she was chosen by Clair, regarded by the film world as an original stylist, for her roles in ''Le Million'' and ''Quatorze Juillet.''         In 1936 she moved on to Britain, where she starred in three movies made there in 1937: ''Wings of the Morning,'' which was in color, ''Under the Red Robe'' and ''Dinner at the Ritz.''         Then Hollywood beckoned, and she appeared in ''The Baroness and the Butler'' (1938) before taking the role in ''Suez.'' That year she also found time to star in ''Hotel du Nord,'' directed by Marcel Carne, a classic with a fond view of working-class Parisians.         In 1940 Annabella and Power performed together in the Screen Guild radio production of ''Seventh Heaven,'' and the next year they were onstage together in a summer stock revival of Ferenc Molnar's hit ''Liliom.''         Over the years she took other roles in theatrical productions in New York, London and elsewhere.  The New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson praised her acting in a 1946 production of Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''No Exit'' as ''a bold and calculated performance that packs one corner of hell with horror.''         She is survived by a daughter, Anne Werner Power of Boston.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.

         Ljuba Welitsch, the flame-haired Bulgarian-born soprano whose career was highlighted by her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Salome'' in 1949, died on Monday in a hospital in Vienna. Miss Welitsch, who had become an Austrian citizen, was 83.         The cause of death was a series of strokes, said Herta Wiedenhuber, the executor of her estate.         Miss Welitsch's performance in the title role of the Richard Strauss opera on Feb. 4, 1949, was regarded as one of the most memorable in Metropolitan Opera history. The packed house had turned out mainly to hear Fritz Reiner make his Met debut as a conductor, but by the time the performance ended, with at least 15 minutes of cheering and whistling from an ecstatic audience, Miss Welitsch had become an international star.         ''Miss Welitsch is a musician and interpreter of flaming temperament, who has the part absolutely in her hand,'' Olin Downes wrote in his review in The New York Times the next day. ''She is an actress of individuality and power.''         A few days later, Miss Welitsch dazzled the critics again, displaying her versatility in the title role of Verdi's ''Aida'' and prompting Howard Taubman of The Times to call her ''one of the few perfect singers to come to the Met in recent years.''         But Miss Welitsch's extensive repertory and her determination to make up for the years on the international stage that she had lost during World War II shortened her operatic career. She drove her voice mercilessly, and by the mid-1950's, critics seemed to agree that her best singing was behind her.         At the Met, she appeared in 63 performances between her debut and her final appearance, in the nonsinging role of the Duchesss of Krakenthorp in Donizetti's ''Fille du Regiment'' on Feb. 17, 1972.         Besides Salome and Aida, her Metropolitan Opera roles included Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' the title role in Puccini's ''Tosca,'' Rosalinde in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus'' and Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme.''         But most of Miss Welitsch's career was spent in Europe, where she was coached by the composer when she made her Vienna Opera debut in a special performance of ''Salome'' that celebrated Richard Strauss's 80th birthday in 1944.         Even when her career in grand opera faded, Miss Welitsch's love of performance kept her busy into the early 1980's in operetta, films, radio, television and on the stage.         She was born in Borissovo, on the Black Sea in Bulgaria, on July 10, 1913. As a child, she liked to sing and play the violin. By her teens she was taking singing lessons, and at 19 entered the Academy of Music in Vienna.         She began her professional career in 1936 with the Graz Opera Company, which played a 10-month season that enabled Miss Welitsch to build her repertory. From 1941 to 1943 she sang in Hamburg and from 1943 to 1946 in Munich. In 1943 she also joined the Vienna Opera, where she made her noteworthy debut in ''Salome'' the next year.         When she made her English debut with the company in 1947, she dazzled audiences at Covent Garden, and by 1948 she had sung Salome more than 50 times and appeared in more than 40 other roles. That summer, while abroad, Edward Johnson, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard Miss Welitsch and engaged her to sing in New York the following year.         In 1956, when she was 43, Miss Welitsch caused a stir in Vienna when she married Karl Schmalvogel, a 29-year-old traffic policeman who had assisted her after an accident a year earlier. They were divorced in 1969.         Miss Welitsch left no immediate survivors.       
         Peg LaCentra, a singer with Artie Shaw's first orchestra, died on June 1 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, said David McCain, a musicologist and friend who learned only recently of Miss LaCentra's death.         Miss LaCentra, who was named Margherita at birth in Boston, studied piano at the New England Conservatory of Music and acting at the Fenway Academy of Dramatic Art. In 1931, after working for a local radio station as an announcer, actress and occasionally a singer, she moved to New York, where she sang on network radio programs, although she considered herself primarily an actress. In 1934 she made her first recording, ''The Fortune Teller,'' with the Johnny Green Orchestra, for Columbia. In 1939 she was given her own program on NBC, ''The Peg LaCentra Show.''         Miss La Centra met Mr. Shaw when she was singing on ''The Mell-O-Roll Ice Cream Show'' and he was a sideman in the Dick McDonough Orchestra. Mr. Shaw told her he was preparing to form his own orchestra and needed a singer. She joined the group in the summer of 1936, performing at the Lexington Hotel and the Paramount Theater in New York.         For a year she recorded extensively with the orchestra on the Brunswick label. She later made records for the Bluebird label with Jerry Sears.         Miss LaCentra appeared in many film shorts and did the vocal dubbing for Ida Lupino in ''The Man I Love,'' Susan Hayward in ''Smash Up'' and other stars.         In 1939 Miss LaCentra married the radio actor Paul Stewart, an original member of Orson Welles's ''Mercury Theater of the Air.'' He died in 1986. She occasionally sang in clubs and appeared in films into the 1950's.         There are no surviving close family members.       
         Beryl Reid, the versatile British character actress who won a Tony Award in 1967 for her performance in ''The Killing of Sister George'' and was one of the most popular stars on the London stage and on British television, died on Sunday. She was 76.         She had developed pneumonia after undergoing a knee operation, her agent, Robert Luff, said. He would not say where she died.         Ms. Reid, who specialized in eccentric characters, had been a stand-up comic and variety entertainer for 30 years before making the transition to more serious acting. She performed in plays by Joe Orton, Edward Albee and Peter Nichols, as well as in classics for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater.         She had her greatest success as June Buckridge in Frank Marcus's ''Killing of Sister George.'' June was a lusty, cigar-smoking soap opera actress whose role as a rural nurse named Sister George was being excised from a long-running radio serial. In the play, which was a hit both in London and New York, Ms. Reid and Eileen Atkins portrayed a lesbian couple in a disintegrating relationship.         Friends had warned Ms. Reid not to touch the play ''with a barge pole,'' thinking that the role would damage her image. Instead, it made her international reputation. She later starred in the Robert Aldrich film version, with Susannah York replacing Ms. Atkins. Sister George became her signature role, but it was one of several peaks in her career.         She played the seductive landlady in the film of Joe Orton's ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' and recreated that role in a 1975 revival of the play at the Royal Court Theater. Subsequently, she won more admirers in the United States and London through television, especially from her role opposite Alec Guinness in the dramatizations of John le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ''Smiley's People.'' Ms. Reid was Connie Sachs, George Smiley's former research aide, who, despite her drinking, retained her exceptional memory.         Ms. Reid was born in Hereford, England. Leaving school at 16, she made her debut in 1936 as a music hall performer at the Floral Hall, Bridlington. Before and during World War II, she took part in variety shows and pantomimes. Her comic imagination was certified on the BBC radio series ''Educating Archie,'' in which she created and played two contrasting roles, a schoolgirl in love with a ventriloquist's dummy and an earthy teen-ager with airs.         In 1951, she made her London stage debut in ''After the Show,'' followed by a series of musical revues, in which she demonstrated the transforming ability of a chameleon. She said she usually played 16 to 18 characters in one night and never looked the same. After Ms. Reid appeared in a revue sketch by Harold Pinter in 1959, Harold Clurman called her ''a real artist and trouper with technical command.''         ''Sister George,'' first presented in Bristol and in London in 1965, was her breakthrough. Later she acted in Mr. Albee's ''Counting the Ways'' at the National, in Congreve's ''Way of the World'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and in Mr. Nichols's ''Born in the Gardens.''         Her films include ''The Belles of St. Trinian's,'' ''The Dock Brief'' (renamed ''Trial and Error'' in the United States), ''Inspector Clouseau'' and Dylan Thomas's ''Doctor and the Devils.''         In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby described her role in ''Joseph Andrews'' in 1977 as ''a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver trying to be dainty.''         Ms. Reid wrote an autobiography, ''So Much Love,'' and was the co-author of ''Cats' Whiskers'' and ''Beryl, Food and Friends.'' In 1986 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.         Married and divorced twice, she lived in a cottage in Wraysbury, outside London. No immediate family members survive.       
         Hannah Green, an acclaimed author who wrote one slender novel of such delicately distilled perfection that she could hardly bring herself to compose another, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital in Manhattan, six months after the reissue of her classic work, ''The Dead of the House,'' had been received with almost as much critical enthusiasm as its original publication a generation ago. She was 69 and lived in Greenwich Village.         Her husband, the painter John Wesley, said the cause was lung cancer.         ''The Dead of the House'' was, by format, just another example of a well-worn genre, a coming-of-age novel, in this case a fictionalized account of Ms. Green's childhood in an Ohio village and on the summertime shores of Lake Michigan.         But in her hands the familiar pangs of childhood, the adolescent passage from virginity to passion and the sobering loss of a first love were so exquisitely wrought that critics were instantly smitten.         Indeed, when ''The Dead of the House'' was published by Doubleday in 1972, the author Richard Ellman said reading it was like falling in love.         ''I was, for as long as it took,'' he wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''able to surrender my own callowness and smugness to the ecstasy that is fiction, is art.''         Other critics had similar praise, which was echoed when Books & Company/Turtle Point Press reissued the book this year. If such enthusiasm seems extreme for what was, after all, a first novel, there was ample evidence that this was a very special first novel. Among other things, the budding first novelist was 46 years old and had been working on the book for the better part of two decades.         She was also a highly schooled professional who had studied with Vladmir Nabokov at Wellesley and with Wallace Stegner while obtaining a master's degree at Stanford. She taught at Stanford for a while before coming to New York and beginning a part-time career as a teacher of creative writing, first at Columbia and later at New York University.         Ms. Green, a native of Glendale, Ohio, was also a precocious child who early on encountered the frustrations of writing that would bedevil her the rest of her life. When she was 4, her husband said, she dreamed up a story about a mischievous pig, but in trying to compose it on her slate could not even get through the title. Her childhood scrawl was so large that she ran out of space after ''The Misch.''         In later years Ms. Green's problem was not her handwriting (she composed on a manual typewriter) but her almost obsessive pursuit of a perfection that always seemed just one rewrite away.         The real wonder of ''The Dead of the House,'' her husband suggested, was not that it took so long, but that it was finished at all. ''She never wanted to let go,'' he said.         A tall, dark-haired woman who dressed conventionally and had an open, unassuming smile, away from the typewriter she seemed anything but an artist. Still, she had her transcendent moments, like the time she and her future husband met. A boyfriend had taken her to a party at Mr. Wesley's studio, the painter recalled,  and while the other guests downed canapes and quaffed beer with gusto, she approached him and asked for an orange.         By some coincidence, he said, he did have an orange, and it was immediate love.         The couple were married in 1971, and a few years later, while traveling in France, Ms. Green had another transcendent moment when at a church in Conques, in south-central France, she encountered the bones of Saint Foy, one of the last martyrs to Roman rule.         ''It blew the top of her head off,'' Mr. Wesley said, noting that for the last 25 years his wife had been writing -- and rewriting -- a book about the martyred 12-year-old girl who was betrayed by her father, refused to renounce her faith and put to death, inspiring a cult that continues in France.         Ms. Green's book, ''Golden Spark, Little Saint: My Book of the Hours of Saint Foy,'' which combines fiction with factual accounts of the Conques region and its people, is to be published by Random House next year.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Mary Lonsdale Hickler of Warwick, Mass.       
         Diana Trilling, an uncompromising cultural and social critic and a member of the circle of writers, thinkers and polemicists of the 1930's, 40's and 50's known as the New York intellectuals, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         At one point, as a critic for The Nation, Mrs. Trilling read a novel a day for six and a half years, delivering challenging reviews on some of the most important works of the modern era: Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men,'' Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Age of Reason'' and George Orwell's ''1984.''         As a reviewer, she approached her work with ''force, control and precision,'' said Paul Fussell, the scholar and author, in his introduction to a collection of her criticism titled ''Reviewing the Forties'' (Harcourt Brace, 1978). Her theme, he said, was ''the threat of monomanias and systems and theories and sentimentalities to fiction.'' Above all, he said, she was ''impatient with simplicities,'' but ''generous in recognizing real merit.''         As an intellectual living through the Depression, the rise and fall of Fascism and Communism, World War II, the Holocaust, Prohibition and the sexual revolution, Diana Trilling clung to an old-fashioned ethos.         ''My first responsibility was to my home and family,'' she once said. ''I was able to deceive myself that it was a matter of free will and competence that I took on the tasks of the home.'' She credited her husband, Lionel Trilling -- one of the century's foremost literary critics and teachers and the author of works like ''The Liberal Imagination'' that became central documents of American intellectual life -- with her success and development as a critical writer, even as she struggled to establish herself in her own right in later years.         Keeping the Flame, While Breaking Free         To everyone, she was a complicated woman, with a passion for language, a zest for cultural contention and a sharp, usually unforgiving pen. Robert Lowell called her ''a housekeeping goddess of reason.''         She began writing in 1941 and never stopped. Fifty-four years later, in her 90th year, with failing eyesight, she composed a 75-page article on the Welsh literary figure Goronwey Rees, offered it for publication to The New Yorker, then headed for her summer home on Cape Cod. Later, back in her ground-floor apartment on Claremont Avenue near Columbia University, she resumed her routine of writing from 9 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon, five days a week.         She believed that ''writers are what they write, also what they fail to write.'' No novels, no volumes of poetry or short fiction bear her name, but among her credits are five books. These include three collections of essays and reviews and an impressionistic piece of journalism, ''Mrs. Harris: The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor'' (Harcourt Brace, 1981), about the sensational murder trial of Jean Harris, the headmistress of an exclusive girls' school, for the murder of her lover. She also wrote ''The Beginning of the Journey'' (Harcourt Brace, 1993), sometimes a memoir, sometimes an apologia, often a long letter of rebuke to those who thought of her as little more than a sidekick to the scholar with whom she lived for 46 years.         Still, the task of keeping Lionel Trilling's flame while trying to break free of its light sometimes seemed to envelop her. She once told an interviewer that the headline on her obituary would read: ''Diana Trilling Dies at 150. Widow of Distinguished Professor and Literary Critic Lionel Trilling.''         His expertise was acquired; he held a doctorate from Columbia University, taught there in the company of brilliant colleagues and challenged students who went on to produce some of the country's finest literature and criticism. Her expertise, on the other hand, was intuitive; her Radcliffe degree in fine arts, she said, left her ill-prepared for anything except a walk through a gallery or a museum.         ''I graduated from Radcliffe without having read a line of Homer or Dante or Chaucer, without knowing anything of Shakespeare,'' she said. So she learned from her husband, ''casually, unconsciously, by association,'' and along the way discovered that she had a natural acuity for language and an innate sense of what made a good book work.         She suggested in her memoir that Lionel Trilling often used her as an editor and tutor on style. ''What I was trying to bring to his writing was a greater directness and greater fluidity,'' she wrote. Nevertheless, she never doubted ''that, of the two of us, he was the more important writer.'' Her husband ''had more to say than I and a great deal more resonated from what he wrote.''         Her work appeared in some of the best magazines in the country, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper's and The Saturday Review, but mainly in two journals that were among those at the center of American intellectual life of the period, The Nation, where she wrote book reviews and literary criticism, and The Partisan Review, to which she contributed essays. Her writing bears out her interest in the relationship between esthetics, morality and society and her determination to express moral judgments -- her critics said moralistic judgments -- on literature and the political issues of the day.         She was a fierce anti-Communist, someone who joined some Communist-front groups in the early 1930's but who then became disaffected by the ruthlessness of Stalin, and for the rest of her public life she wore the ideals of Western democracy on her sleeve. Perhaps it was this disaffection that led her to think of herself as a rationalist bent on exposing empty slogans and ideas -- political, literary and cultural. And it was this stance, the immovable anti-Communist who insisted that all ideas be grounded in rationality and morality, that dominated her work.         'An Anxious World' Filled With Fears         A native New Yorker, she was born on July 21, 1905, one of three children of Helene Forbert Rubin and Joseph Rubin, a manufacturer of straw braid. Her parents were immigrant Polish Jews who moved with their children from Westchester to Brooklyn to Manhattan. ''Pleasure was not the principle of our home,'' Mrs. Trilling once wrote. ''I learned early in life that to laugh before breakfast was to cry before dinner.''         She described herself as an ''excessively fearful'' child. First she was afraid of the dark, then of burglars and, as she grew older, eventually of just about everything, especially being alone or leaving the house. ''I regard the whole of my life as having been lived in an anxious world,'' she said.         Her fears, indeed her fear of having so many fears, may have shaped her choice of work, she came to believe, because they made her ''too intent upon reasonableness'' and ''blocked the free play of my imagination.'' Thus she stuck to analytical writing, preferring the logical and cerebral to the fantastic.         In 1927, in a Manhattan speak-easy -- over a drink called a bullfrog (gin, apricot brandy and grenadine) -- she met Lionel Trilling. He was smart and handsome, a graduate student in literature at Columbia. In a short time, they fell in love. Later they slept together. (''Surely going to bed with a man before marriage was the most courageous act of my life,'' she said.) And in 1929, they were married.         ''With marriage I had entered Lionel's world,'' she said. ''It was with his friends that I now chiefly associated. They were not easy companions, these intellectuals. They were overbearing and arrogant, excessively competitive; they lacked magnanimity and often they lacked common courtesy. Ours was a cruelly judgmental society, often malicious and riddled with envy.''         But what a society it was, with Alfred Kazin, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, William Phillips, Sidney Hook, Delmore Schwartz, Dwight McDonald, Hannah Arendt, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, Clement Greenberg, Irving Kristol and several others striving to set the intellectual agenda of the nation.         In book-cluttered apartments on the Upper West Side, they lived what Mrs. Trilling called ''a life of significant contention.'' In the pages of The Partisan Review, Commentary, The Nation and Dissent, they debated whether America should enter World War II. They quarreled over Trotsky and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Beats and the Columbia riots to such an extent that many of the survivors have not spoken to one another for years.         When these intellectuals were not preoccupied by ideas or pulling apart the culture, they talked incessantly, Mrs. Trilling remembered in her memoir, ''about sex, sex, and more sex, with particular emphasis upon adultery.'' Sex, she continued, ''took up as much conversational space as in later years we would give to politics.''         Wielding Her Pen With Candor         Diana Trilling's career as a critic began in 1941, at the age of 36, when she overheard a telephone conversation between her husband and Margaret Marshall, the literary editor of The Nation, who had called to ask if he could recommend someone to write the magazine's literary notes column. When her husband hung up, Mrs. Trilling looked at him and offered herself for the position.         She held the job for 10 years, often wielding her pen like a Bowie knife: ''A mad, bad, and dangerous book, Allan Seager's 'Equinox' is fiction's most recent attempt to practice psychiatry without a license.'' Or, of Truman Capote's ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'': ''I find myself deeply antipathetic to the whole artistic-moral purpose of Mr. Capote's novel. I would freely trade 80 percent of his technical skill for 20 percent more value in the uses to which it is put.''         She was proud of her reputation as a clear-eyed, uncompromising critic. She liked to tell the story of a Viennese novelist, a refugee from Nazi Austria, who ''was said to have remarked that he had lost his country, his home, his language, but that he had at least one good fortune; he has not been reviewed by me.''         As she approached her 42d birthday, she decided that she and her husband had been squandering their lives. ''We were afraid to be full grown up and to be in command of ourselves and others.'' And so she became pregnant. Their only child, James, was born shortly thereafter, in 1947. James, of Providence, R.I., survives her, as do two grandchildren.         In 1975, Lionel Trilling died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 70, and in the years that followed, she worked hard to assure his legacy, editing a 12-volume uniform edition of his work. But she also strove successfully to establish her own mark, writing essays, publishing two collections of criticism -- ''Reviewing the Forties''  and ''We Must My Darlings'' (Harcourt Brace, 1977) -- and covering the Jean Harris trial. Then, suffering from macular degeneration that left her with eyesight so poor she could no longer type, she dictated her memoir, ''The Beginning of the Journey.''         To the last, she remained contentious, complaining of America's loss of intellectual culture. ''I think the life of significant contention no longer exists,'' she told New York magazine in 1995. ''We have enormous division in our society on sectarian or ideological lines. But we don't have any discourse.'' She said that the best academic minds had drifted into esoteric specialization and she assailed multiculturalism as ''our present-day version of Stalinism -- a culture of moral virtue without thought.''         Earlier this year The New Yorker published her brief memoir of her days at summer camp, and she finished her last book, ''A Visit to Camelot,'' an account of an evening spent at the White House when John F. Kennedy was President.         Three or four times a week in her later years, friends would come to the cluttered apartment to read to her. Among them was the poet Richard Howard, who said that despite her infirmities, she remained ''remarkably autonomous.''         Often the conversation turned to Lionel Trilling. ''Seventeen years have now passed since Lionel's death,'' she wrote at the conclusion of her memoir, ''and hour by hour, minute by minute I still listen for a clock which no longer ticks.''         Correction:  October 31, 1996, Thursday         An obituary of the critic and writer Diana Trilling on Friday omitted part of the title of a collection of her essays. It is ''We Must March My Darlings.''       
         Angela Romano Perez, an advocate for the disabled whose life was a model of the personal independence, responsibility and achievement she championed, died on Friday at the Cabrini Hospice in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan. Ms. Perez, a lifelong resident of the Upper East Side, was 49.         Her husband, Joseph, said the cause was breast cancer.         Ms. Perez, who was born with cerebral palsy, spent her life trying to change the prejudices that disabled people often encounter or even impose on themselves.         At her death, she was the program director of the Y.W.C.A. of New York City, for which she directed the Networking Project for People With Disabilities. ''The project was founded to provide young people with disabilities with positive role models because, particularly for young women with disabilities, there tends to be a lack of visible, appealing role models,'' said Madeline F. Beusse, a consultant who worked with Ms. Perez on the financing of the project. ''The project is about empowerment, boosting self-esteem and opening doors.''         Besides leading the Networking Project, which is paid for by the city's Youth Services Department and private donations, Ms. Perez designed and oversaw a study of the accessibility of health services for disabled women. Called ''Breaking Down Barriers: Eliminating Obstacles to Reproductive Health Care for Women With Disabilities'' and financed by the New York State Department of Health, the study is continuing. The findings and recommendations are to be presented by its board -- health care professionals, disability advocates and corporate and public officials -- at a conference in the spring.         Before taking the Y.W.C.A. post in 1988, Ms. Perez was the educational counseling coordinator for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, from 1983 to 1987.         Working to raise awareness of domestic violence against people with disabilities, she served on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's task force on domestic violence, giving a voice to some of the more vulnerable victims of abuse.         Ms. Perez was also on the board of directors of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled and a vice president of Women With Disabilities, both of which are advocacy and service organizations.         Combining advocacy with her love of travel, Ms. Perez attended the nongovernmental forum on women held in Beijing in conjunction with the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women last year. She went frequently to Canada to collaborate with the Disabled Women's Networ, and traveled as well to Japan, Thailand, Austria, Britain and Italy and throughout the United States.         On Oct. 5, her birthday, a personal letter of commendation from Hillary Rodham Clinton was delivered to Ms. Perez's room at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she had been under care since August. It was followed by a letter from the Mayor, commending Ms. Perez for the difference she had made in the life of New Yorkers.         Ms. Perez held two degrees from Hunter College: a Bachelor of Arts in psychology, awarded in 1978, and a Master of Science in education, awarded in 1983.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Stephen and Mary Romano, and her brother, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Mignon G. Eberhart, a highly prolific author of mystery novels who specialized in stories that combined romance and suspense, died yesterday in the Nathaniel Witherell nursing home in Greenwich, Conn., where she lived. She was 97.         In a 60-year career, Mrs. Eberhardt was one of the most popular mystery writers and one of the most highly paid. She wrote 59 books, including novels and several collections of stories. Her first mystery was published in 1929 and her last, ''Three Days for Emeralds,'' in 1988, when she was in her late 80's.         Her novels have been translated into more than 20 languages, and in the 1930's many of them were turned into movies. Several of her books are still in print, and six of her early novels were recently republished by the University of Nebraska Press.         Reviewing Mrs. Eberhart's ''Next of Kin'' in 1982, Newgate Callendar wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book ''contains all of the formulas she has so successfully conjured up through the years -- rich families, nice people, romance, something of a locked-room mystery, lots of suspects.''         Mignon Good was born in Lincoln, Neb., on July 6, 1899. She studied for three years at Nebraska Wesleyan University. In 1923, soon after her marriage to Alanson Eberhart, an engineer, she began writing in earnest.         ''The Dark Corridor,'' a novella, was printed in 1925 in Flynn's, a detective magazine. Her first novel,  ''The Patient in Room 18,'' featured Nurse Sarah Keate, an amateur sleuth who worked with a young detective, Lance O'Leary. With or without Detective O'Leary, Nurse Sarah starred in other Eberhart mysteries and was played on the screen by Aline MacMahon, Jane Darwell and Ann Sheridan. Mrs. Eberhart's other detectives included Susan Dare, a mystery writer, and James Wickwire, a banker.         With her penchant for plucky heroines in distress, Mrs. Eberhart was considered a disciple of Mary Roberts Rinehart, but eventually she became known as a writer of romance mysteries with a touch of the gothic. In this area she influenced writers like Mary Higgins Clark.         Her atmospheric stories often took place in exotic locales: Hong Kong, Lisbon, the Caribbean. Among her books are ''While the Patient Slept'' (her second novel, which won the $5,000 Scotland Yard Prize in 1930), ''Never Look Back,'' ''Call After Midnight,'' ''Run Scared,'' ''Speak No Evil'' and ''With This Ring.'' In collaboration with Robert Wallsten, she adapted her novel ''Fair Warning,'' into a play, ''Eight O'Clock Tuesday,'' which ran on Broadway in 1941.         When she was asked to name her favorite writers, she said that she never missed a book by Agatha Christie or Ngaio Marsh. ''They are old friends, of course. But my real love is for the brotherhood and sisterhood of the genre.'' She added, ''I love mystery writers as a breed, and am so glad to belong.''         No immediate family members survive.       
         Alma Kitchell, a pioneering radio singer who became a pioneering talk show host, sang in the first televised opera and capped her career by presiding over the first television cooking show, died on Wednesday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 103.         She was known as the Golden Voice of the Golden Age of radio, and from the time she walked into NBC's old New York station, WJZ, in 1927 and sang her way into a job, her rich contralto was rarely silent for the next two decades.         After singing regularly on the local station for a year, she moved up to NBC's old Blue network, spending two years with the NBC Opera Company and five years as the soloist on a weekly program with the NBC concert orchestra before increasing her schedule to three nights a week for a seven-year run.         By the time she abandoned broadcast singing in 1940, Miss Kitchell had embarked on a new phase of her vocal career, as the originator and host of a series of talk shows devoted to women's concerns. Her program and Mary Margaret McBride's, which ran on NBC's Red network, are regarded as the first radio talk shows.         Under names like ''Let's Talk It Over,'' ''Women's Exchange,'' and ''Alma Kitchell's Brief Case,'' in which she answered her voluminous mail, the programs were broadcast from 1938 to 1947, initially on NBC and later on ABC, the network organized in 1943 to take over NBC's Blue network.         Along the way, Miss Kitchell interviewed prominent women like Eleanor Roosevelt, discussed family and social issues and chatted about her own active life.         For all the fans she acquired as a singer, Miss Kitchell became even more famous as a talk show host, and she put her celebrity to civic use, especially during World War II. She once sang on the air while giving blood, for example, and she conceived of and popularized the slogan ''A Stamp a Day for the Man Who's Away'' to help sell war bonds.         A formidable woman on or off the air, Miss Kitchell, who had been sent on cross-country speaking tours by NBC to promote radio, became an important fund-raiser for the Republican Party in New York and was named to state commissions by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey.         A native of Superior, Wis., Miss Kitchell, whose maiden name was Hopkins, began singing locally. She studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory and came to New York in 1912 at the age of 19 to pursue a professional career.         According to family legend, she was chaperoned by her mother during her first year in New York, spent the second year on her own and in the third married her voice teacher, Charles W. Kitchell.         She began by singing with major local choral societies and orchestras, and made her debut at Town Hall in 1924 in a program that included Bach and Handel airs, Swiss and Jewish folksongs and modern French, German and Russian songs with American lyrics.         By the time she began her radio career in 1927, Miss Kitchell had already established her credentials as a broadcast pioneer. In 1917, six years before regular broadcasts were begun, she sang for an experimental station established at the base of the Statue of Liberty.         For all her devotion to music, Miss Kitchell came to love radio more. In 1937, she turned down an opportunity to join the Metropolitan Opera in order to stay in broadcasting.         Although she was primarily known for her work in radio, Miss Kitchell was a pioneer in television as well. In 1939, when RCA began the first experimental television broadcasts from its Rockefeller Center headquarters, she sang the part of Ruth, the piratical maid of all work, in the first televised opera, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance.''         Eight years later, at the dawn of network television in 1947, Miss Kitchell abandoned her radio career and ABC to return to NBC and make television history once again, this time as the star of the first commercial network television series, also  television's first cooking show, ''In the Kelvinator Kitchen.''         She remained on the program until 1949, then retired from public life.         Miss Kitchell, whose first husband died in 1956, married Joseph Yoder, a retired chemical engineer, in 1965 and settled in Florida. Mr. Yoder died about a decade ago.         Miss Kitchell remained in vigorous health until her 100th birthday. It was an occasion noted by Willard Scott, the ''Today'' weatherman, from NBC's studios in the same building where she had helped open the television era a half-century earlier.         She is survived by two sons,  Charles Kitchell of Osterville, Mass.,  and James Kitchell of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and four great-grandhildren.       
         Virginia Cherrill, a 1930's actress who starred as a beautiful, blind flower girl in the classic Charlie Chaplin silent film ''City Lights'' (1931), died late Thursday in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 88 and had settled in Santa Barbara in 1950.         Miss Cherrill was born near Carthage, Ill. and educated at schools in Kenosha, Wis., and Chicago.         After an early marriage to Irving Adler, a Chicago lawyer, ended in divorce, she went to California to recover and met Chaplin there. He has variously been said to have first noticed her on a California beach and when they were both at a boxing match.         David Robinson, film critic for The Times of London, wrote in a 1985 biography of Chaplin that the actor gave Miss Cherrill the part of the flower girl largely because she portrayed a blind person appealingly, in a test, after he advised her to look at him but ''to look inwardly and not to see me.''         In the movie, Chaplin starred opposite her as a little tramp who fell in love with her. Its final scene, with close-ups of Miss Cherrill, has won special praise. The writer and critic James Agee called it ''enough to shrivel the heart to see, the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''         Miss Cherrill starred in several other American-made movies in the early 1930's and met Cary Grant at a film premiere. They were married in 1933, and she went on to retire briefly from movie making.         Their divorce came in 1935. Then she resumed her career, again briefly, in Britain, where she acted in two films. Later she said, ''I was no great shakes as an actress.''         She retired from movie making for good when she began her nine-year marriage to the ninth Earl of Jersey, in 1937.         As the Countess of Jersey, she did charity work in Britain during World War II.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Florian Martini, a World War II flying ace.       
         Suzanne Railey, a representative for Christie's auction house who was known for her talents as an international hostess, died last weekend in her Manhattan apartment. She was 85.         She died in her sleep, Ed Gallagher, a longtime friend, told Christie's. She had a list of guests for her next dinner party at her bedside, he said.         Ms. Railey, who was known as Sue, lived most of her life in Paris and New York, and had been employed by Christie's in New York since March 1985. She was a public relations ambassador of sorts. Her only  role for the auction house was to hold a black-tie dinner party at her home each month, drawing on her long list of wealthy and influential friends, many with extensive art collections. The idea was to generate good will, and eventually business, for the auction house.         Seated at the tables in her two bedroom apartment in the East 60's  would be diplomats, society doyennes and fashion designers.         ''It all depends who's in town and what I'm thinking about,'' Ms. Railey said during an interview last week.         The jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent dinner guest at her house, said: ''You never knew who you'd be seated next to. She always had good people. And her apartment was amazing, with more objects than you could count on every table and mirrors on the ceilings.''         Entertaining and collecting were what she enjoyed.         ''You must talk to me about dinner parties,'' Ms. Railey said, standing at Alexis Gregory's dinner party on Dec. 2, clutching a black pocketbook with a big white clock on top. ''I love them so much. It's just so much more attractive to entertain at home. You can actually sit and talk.''         Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's, said, ''Her apartment was filled with all these treasures of Europe.'' She collected portraits from the French Revolutionary period, miniatures and African works of art, and also had a large collection of letter seals.         She was born Suzanne Rosenberg in Rochester. Her family owned a department store. As a young girl she traveled to Manhattan, Washington and Paris with her parents, said David Granger, a longtime friend.         She lived in Manhattan during part of her 20's with an uncle, Ed Goodman, who owed Finchley's, a men's clothing store. Mr. Granger said, ''And she did what popular young girls do, she traveled and went to parties.''         Then she moved to Washington,  where she started Overcoats for Britain, a program shipping coats to England during World War II.         In 1950, she married Howard Barclay Railey, a businessman who was attached to the American Embassy in Paris. For the next 33 years, she lived and entertained in ''a romantic apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris,'' said Ethel de Croisset, a close friend who lives in Paris.         ''She was a born brilliant hostess,'' she said. ''She was always friends with all the ambassadors.'' When her husband died, Ms. Railey moved back to Manhattan and began working for Christie's.         She is survived by two stepsons.

         Barbara Skelton, a writer whose best subject was her own life of passionate abandon, died on Saturday in Worcestershire in western England from a brain tumor, The Times of London reported on Monday. She was 79.         Her two volumes of memoirs -- "Tears Before Bedtime" (1987) and "Weep No More" (1989) -- were savored for their malicious descriptions of her three husbands and many lovers, including King Farouk of Egypt and a police officer who came to investigate a burglary at her home.         She was married three times: to the literary critic Cyril Connolly from 1950 to 1956; to the publisher George Weidenfeld from 1956 to 1961, and briefly to Derek Jackson, a newspaper heir, in 1966.         She wrote two novels, "A Young Girl's Touch" (1956) and "A Love Match" (1969), though the latter was withdrawn because of threats of legal action by a  former friend. Her two memoirs became the basis for a 1995 film.       
         Lidiya Chukovskaya, the Russian writer who risked her life to record the horrors of Stalinism and speak out against the persecutions of dissidents in the Soviet Union, died on Wednesday at her home in Moscow. She was 88.         As a champion of human rights, Miss Chukovskaya criticized the trial of Andrei D. Sinyavsky and Yuli M. Daniel, who were jailed in the 1960's for their  satiric commentaries on the Soviet system. She also defended the dissident nuclear physicist Andrei D. Sakharov in 1973 and lent her country house to Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author, before he was arrested and deported from the Soviet Union in 1974.         Ideas should be fought with ideas," she said, "not with camps and prisons."         In a statement yesterday, reported by The Associated Press, Mr. Solzhenitsyn  said: "Our literature has lost an exquisite connoisseur of Russian poetry and a  precious witness of the Soviet half-century. She preserved for us concealed treasures, which would have perished but for her."         Mr. Solzhenitsyn called Miss Chukovskaya an "incorruptible" and "passionate"  defender of writers and literature.         Miss Chukovskaya was 66, nearly blind and afflicted with a weak heart when her defense of Mr. Sakharov resulted in her expulsion from the Moscow Writers Union by a unanimous vote in 1974.         Accused of having "slipped into an anti-Soviet swamp," she was in effect blacklisted, since expulsion from the organization deprived writers of the means and the legal right to publish their work.         Summoned to a meeting with the union's secretary, Yuri F. Strekhinin, and another writer, A. M. Mednikov, she was questioned about her criticism of the treatment of dissidents.         "How do you know these things?" she said she was asked.         "From my life," Miss Chukovskaya said she answered. "From mothers, wives, sisters. In order not to see, you have to shut your eyes and cover your ears. It's all around."         "They put one of my friends who was completely healthy in an insane asylum,"  she later recounted having told them. "I knew he was healthy."         She said Mr. Mednikov asked her, "Why does all this happen around you and nothing like that happens around me?"         Miss Chukovskaya replied: "I don't know -- maybe you are living on an island. You make a special effort not to see."         Her differences with the authorities did not end with the breakup of the Soviet Union. When the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, awarded Miss Chukovskaya a literary prize last year, she refused the money because she disagreed with Moscow's military campaign to keep Chechnya a part of Russia, said her longtime friend and English translator, Sylvia Rubashova, who lives in  London.         "She was very uncompromising," Mrs. Rubashova said.         The work that brought Miss Chukovskaya the prize was "The Akhmatova Journals," a recollection of her friendship with the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966), who lost two husbands to Soviet repression.         Miss Chukovskaya was the daughter of a prominent writer and the widow of an author who died in the Stalinist purges of the 1930's. She was renowned for her  love of poetry and for a prodigious memory that enabled her to save countless poems from destruction by learning them by heart.         Among her other books were "Sofiya Petrovna," written in the winter of 1939-40 but not published until 1967, when it was smuggled to the West and issued under the title "The Deserted House."         The semi-autobiographical novel, set down while the memory of Stalin's Great  Purge was still fresh, conveyed the atmosphere of fear and terror that engulfed  the Soviet Union as the crackdown gathered force.         John J. Stephan, a friend who is a professor of history at the University of  Hawaii, said the manuscript of "Sofiya Petrovna" was passed along and hidden at  a time when its possession would have been tantamount to a death sentence.         She was also the author of "Going Under" (1976), a description of the corruption of writers by Soviet power.         Miss Chukovskaya's "To the Memory of Childhood," also published in 1988, was  a tribute to her father, Kornei Chukovsky, a Russian critic, translator and popular author of children's verse and fairy tales. Covering the years 1910 to 1917, it recalled her upbringing at the family home in Kuokkala on the Gulf of Finland.         Miss Chukovskaya was born on March 23, 1907 in Leningrad and spent her summers in Kuokkala. She served as her father's amanuensis, and in "To the Memory of Childhood" she described him as a humorous, fun-loving man who was passionate about language and fanatical about poetry.         She married M. P. Bronshtein, an eminent physicist who died in prison in 1938. For some years she worked as an editor for a children's book publisher in  Moscow.         Miss Chukovskaya is survived by her daughter, Yelena, of Moscow.
