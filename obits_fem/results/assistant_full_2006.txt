         Erica Reiner, an internationally renowned scholar of Assyrian, one of the world's oldest written languages, died on Dec. 31 at her home in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. She was 81.         The cause was lung cancer, according to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, where she was the John A. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor emeritus.         Dr. Reiner spent 44 years working on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, the first of several such monumental undertakings in ancient languages in the United States, and saw it through to completion. Work on the Assyrian project started in 1921. She joined it as a research assistant in 1952, became an associate editor in 1956, editor in 1962, and finally editor in charge from 1973 until her retirement in 1996.         Assyrian, an ornately complex language more commonly called Akkadian, originated in the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers, in Mesopotamia, but in the second millennium B.C. served as a common means of communication throughout the Middle East. From about 2600 B.C. on, it was written in cuneiform, or wedge-shaped letters, impressed by stylus on wax or clay or incised in stone.         Akkadian was the region's predominant tongue for more than 2,500 years, and the dictionary, more than a mere list of words, grew into an encyclopedia of the region's culture, including law, astronomy, poetry, religion and the history of science. Its first volume was published in 1956. It now includes 23 volumes, with two more at the printer and a final volume due later this year.         Dr. Reiner had a hand in all the volumes, said Martha Roth of the institute, now the dictionary's editor in charge, because she continued to write, review and edit entries for them after her formal retirement.         Dr. Reiner's knowledge of Babylonian history of science was legendary among scholars. She wrote ''Astral Magic in Babylonia'' (1995), which traced the roots of Greek medicine and science to Babylonian magical practices using plants and other ingredients and seeking to harness the powers of celestial bodies. Two other books remain in print, ''Adventure of Great Dimension: The Launching of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary'' (2002), and ''Letters from Early Mesopotamia'' (1993), which she edited.         She published ''A Linguistic Analysis of Akkadian'' in 1966 and a collection of essays on the poetry of Babylonia and Assyria in 1985. She was one of only a few people alive proficient in the ancient language called Elamite and published a grammar in 1969.         Erica Reiner was born in Budapest, where she received an undergraduate degree in linguistics in 1948. She studied Elamite, Sumerian and Akkadian in Paris for a diploma from the Ã‰cole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1955, the year before she joined the faculty. By that time, three decades had been spent on planning and preparing the Assyrian dictionary, but no draft existed.         Dr. Reiner succeeded in securing sustained support for the project from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1976. A comprehensive record of a past civilization, it was the endowment's longest project, lasting more than 30 years, and the one with the highest level of support. It also became a Mecca for scholars from around the world.         Dr. Reiner is survived by a sister, Eva Cherna of Montreal.       
         Sarah Caldwell, one of America's best known and most adventurous conductors and opera directors and the founding director of the Opera Company of Boston, died Thursday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. She was 82.         She died of heart failure, said James Morgan, a former manager of the Boston company and a close associate.         Ms. Caldwell, who was also the first woman to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera, lived in Freeport, Me.         In 1990, 32 years after its founding, facing debt and disarray, the Opera Company of Boston went out of business. But in its glory years, Ms. Caldwell's company was a model of bold, imaginative programming, offering musically insightful productions with distinguished casts.         ''Some of the most creative work that many of us artists have done has been with Sarah,'' Beverly Sills, the soprano and former chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera, said yesterday. ''Some of the most aggravating, as well. She had a million different ways to do one thing and was never satisfied until she had tried them all.''         Ms. Caldwell often took on difficult 20th-century operas that bigger companies shirked. Her productions included the American premieres of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace,'' Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' Roger Sessions's ''Montezuma,'' Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Taverner'' and Rodion Shchedrin's ''Dead Souls,'' as well as the world premieres of Gunther Schuller's ''Fisherman and His Wife'' and Robert Di Domenica's ''Balcony.''         Her company seldom presented more than four productions a season. But from the start, Ms. Caldwell attracted world-class artists, notably Ms. Sills and Dame Joan Sutherland. She was both director and conductor for most of her productions -- a double role that often imbued them with a strong vision. But her split duties just as often seemed to divide her attention, resulting in weakened execution onstage and in the orchestra pit.         Ms. Caldwell's longest period of success came in the 1970's, when the company was thriving and her visibility as a conductor was growing. In 1974, she became only the second woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic. (Nadia Boulanger had been the first in 1939 and again in 1962.) For the program, partly sponsored by Ms. magazine, Ms. Caldwell offered only works by women, among them Ruth Crawford Seeger, Lili Boulanger and Thea Musgrave.         A Time magazine cover story on Nov. 10, 1975, called her ''Music's Wonder Woman.'' Two months later, on Jan. 13, 1976, she became the first woman to conduct at the Met. The opera was ''La Traviata,'' starring Ms. Sills, who had cajoled the company into engaging Ms. Caldwell. She conducted 11 total performances.         As a company director, Ms. Caldwell was notoriously disorganized and loath to delegate authority. Only 5 feet 3 inches tall and, for most of her life, overweight, she was an indomitable but chaotic force. Rehearsal periods were typically fraught with crisis. Ms. Caldwell, sleepless and disheveled, would keep stage crews working all night and fight off creditors all day. Stories abounded of staff members' finding their boss napping in a stairwell or atop a pile of costumes backstage.         Yet, even on a shoestring budget, she managed to present challenging repertory in inventive productions. One, in 1965, was Rossini's ''Semiramide,'' a rarely performed work at the time, with Dame Joan and Marilyn Horne. Ms. Caldwell also staged the United States premiere of ''Boris Godunov'' with Mussorgsky's original orchestration nine years before the Metropolitan Opera did. And hers was the first complete American staging of Berlioz's ''Troyens.''         Ms. Caldwell faced formidable obstacles in running her company. Financial support from the Boston civic and cultural worlds was inconsistent, and the company lacked an adequate theater. The year her company began, 1958, the long-neglected 50-year-old Boston Opera House was torn down, and the new company was forced into a nomadic existence, performing at the Donnelly Theater (razed in 1968), then the downtown Shubert Theater and then a series of unlikely places, like a university gym and a South End cyclorama.         The company finally settled at the Orpheum Theater, staying for five years. But the stage was only 26 feet deep, and there was no orchestra pit. Ms. Caldwell's solution was to remove several rows of seats from the orchestra section to make room for her players. She conducted sitting in a director's chair, usually in slippers.         In 1978, the company bought the B. F. Keith Memorial Theater on Washington Street in downtown Boston, and it finally had a home -- a run-down but potentially excellent 2,500-seat theater with good acoustics and palatial lobbies. But the stage was just 35 feet deep, and the only way to expand would have been to claim a small street that bordered the back of the building, an idea that neighborhood residents and businesses opposed. A complete renovation would have cost only $13 million, Ms. Caldwell estimated. But by 1990, with back taxes looming, she sold the theater to a Texas developer, and her company essentially ceased to exist.         Sarah Caldwell was born on March 6, 1924, in Maryville, Mo. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. During her childhood, she and her brother frequently lived with relatives while her mother, Margaret, was off pursuing graduate studies in music. Ms. Caldwell began taking violin lessons early, and by 6 was giving concerts out of state. When her mother married Henry Alexander, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, the family moved to Fayetteville.         Discouraged by her stepfather from pursuing a career in music, Ms. Caldwell entered the University of Arkansas as a psychology major. Within a year she was a violin major at Hendrix College in Arkansas. She later earned a scholarship from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.         It was her summers in the Berkshires at the Tanglewood Music Institute that shifted her toward opera. There, in 1947, she staged Vaughan Williams's ''Riders to the Sea.'' Her idol, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, who directed the institute, was so impressed, he invited her to join the faculty the next year. During this period she became an assistant to the conductor Boris Goldovsky, who ran an opera program at the New England Conservatory. By 1952, Ms. Caldwell was running one herself, at Boston University, which she kept going for eight years.         She started her own company, initially called the Opera Group, in 1958 with just $5,000 in seed money. By 1965, renamed the Opera Company of Boston, it had won an important place in American opera. She tried to be everything: administrator, fund-raiser, proselytizer. But her assumption of both the director and conductor roles in her productions cost the company time and money. During rehearsals, the orchestra would often sit idly in the pit, collecting union-scale pay, while Ms. Caldwell dealt with a directorial detail onstage.         When everything came together, however, the productions had the kind of cohesiveness usually achievable only in festival conditions. There was, for example, a critically hailed production of Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini'' in 1975 with Jon Vickers in the title role; another vibrant production was of Verdi's ''Macbeth'' with Shirley Verrett, a frequent Caldwell collaborator who became Boston's favorite diva, as Lady Macbeth.         Ms. Caldwell was generally thought to be more gifted as a director. Her ideas were usually backed by enormous amounts of historical research. But her conducting, while technically idiosyncratic and often untidy, was musical and sensitive. And she was a pioneer of colorblind casting in opera.         Ms. Caldwell's constant search for financial support led her into a political quagmire in 1982. She agreed to develop an opera program in the Philippines, signing a contract with Imelda Marcos, the wife of the country's repressive president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. Ms. Caldwell insisted that the contract was with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, not the government. But in reality Mrs. Marcos was financing the center to help build her political power base. A year later, facing protests at home from human-rights groups and outraged company patrons, Ms. Caldwell pulled out of the deal.         In 1988, she organized an ambitious three-week festival called Making Music Together, which took 250 Soviet dancers, musicians, composers and other artists to Boston for some 80 events. The festival was budgeted at $2.4 million. But when corporate support and ticket sales did not meet expectations, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, with the intervention of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, bailed Ms. Caldwell out with more state support, averting a diplomatic embarrassment.         For many years Ms. Caldwell lived with her mother in Weston, a Boston suburb. She leaves no immediate survivors.         In 1999, Ms. Caldwell accepted a post as distinguished professor of music at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, but left within several years because of poor health. Missing New England, she moved to Freeport in 2003.         Ms. Caldwell never gave up hope that she could raise funds and re-start her company. It was not to be. But for a while, as the British critic Andrew Porter wrote in The New Yorker, she was ''the single best thing about opera in America.''       
         Edythe Gaines, a prominent educator who in the 1960's and 70's was one of the highest ranking black officials in the New York City public school system, died on March 23 in Hartford. She was 83.         Ms. Gaines died of natural causes, said her son Richard.         From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Gaines was the executive director of the New York City Board of Education's Office of Educational Planning and Support. The position was one of three senior administrative posts newly created by the board and all carried the title executive director, ranking just below the deputy schools chancellor.         Ms. Gaines left the department in 1975 to become the superintendent of schools in Hartford. She was the first woman, and the first African-American, to hold that post.         Ms. Gaines began her career in 1945 as a teacher in New York City public schools. In 1964, she became the first African-American to serve as principal of a secondary school in the city when she was appointed to lead what was then Junior High School 118, on West 93rd Street in Manhattan. She had taught at the school, which was also called the Joan of Arc School, since the late 1940's.         In 1967, Ms. Gaines was appointed assistant superintendent in charge of School District 12 in the Bronx, where she was responsible for the day-to-day operation of 22 schools serving more than 40,000 students.         Edythe Pauline Jones was born on Sept. 6, 1922, in Asheville, N.C., one of seven children of Jacob Jones, an Episcopal minister, and the former Jennie Dillard, who taught high school English and Latin. Her father died when she was an adolescent, and afterward the family moved to New York.         Ms. Gaines earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from New York University in 1947 and a doctorate in education from Harvard in 1969.         From 1971 to 1973, she directed the Learning Cooperative, an agency of the New York City school system designed to develop educational programs. Ms. Gaines, who left the superintendent's post in Hartford in 1978, was named a commissioner of the Connecticut Public Utilities Control Authority the next year.         Ms. Gaines's husband, Albert Denis Gaines, whom she married in 1941, died in 1995. Besides her son Richard, of Greentown, Pa., she is survived by another son, Mallory, of Newark; five grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89.         She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.         In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities.         At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.         Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.         ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.         Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.         In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.         ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''         Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''         Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''         The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.         Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.         Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.         ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.         ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said.         Action, Not Just Words         Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.         In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape.         The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won.         Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.         She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.         ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.         After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.         But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.         What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.         Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.         A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.         But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.         On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.         In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.         In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.         Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.         In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.         ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''         Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.         ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''         Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.         Subways Lead to Jobs         Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.         She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.         She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.         While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.         Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.         Suspicions Aroused         In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.         ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.         ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''         Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.         ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''         William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.         ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''         The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.         Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''         ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''         Form Over Substance?         Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.         ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.         Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.         She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.         Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.         During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.         She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.         In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.         ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''       
         Maggie Dixon, who coached the women's basketball team at Army to its first N.C.A.A. tournament last month, died Thursday at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 28.         Dr. Millard J. Hyland, the Westchester County medical examiner, performed an autopsy yesterday and said afterward that the cause of death was, in part, an enlarged heart with a mitral valve that was not shutting properly.         Jamie Dixon, Maggie's older brother and the men's basketball coach at Pittsburgh, said she collapsed Wednesday while having tea at a friend's home.         She was taken to the Keller Army Community Hospital at West Point and was airlifted to Westchester Medical Center. He said that she had an arrhythmic episode, an irregular heartbeat, and that she had no history of heart problems.         The Dixons were the first brother and sister to coach in the N.C.A.A. tournaments in the same year.         After five years as an assistant at DePaul, Maggie Dixon became the Army coach in late September, 11 days before the first practice. She inherited a team with players who take up to 24 credits a semester in subjects like engineering, physics and calculus and have limited time for sports.         Her team started the season 5-7, including losses by 39 points to Connecticut and 17 to Baylor. She told her players that losing so badly would turn out to be a good thing. Three weeks ago, she recalled that speech for The New York Times this way:         ''We're just in the spot where we want to be,'' she said she told the team. ''Look, we've played some of the toughest teams in the country -- UConn, Baylor, Princeton -- and we've played well, even though we lost. We're just coming together as a team. We're learning to play with each other. We're gaining confidence.''         Her team won the Patriot League regular-season championship for the first time. It then won the conference tournament, and its automatic N.C.A.A. Division I tournament berth, for the first time.         After a 69-68 victory against Holy Cross in the Patriot League tournament final, Dixon was carried around the arena by Army football players. When she entered the dining room for dinner, she received a standing ovation from the corps of cadets.         In the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, her team was routed by Tennessee, a perennial national power, 102-54, and finished 20-11. In that game, Candace Parker of Tennessee made the first dunk in women's N.C.A.A. tournament history (she had two).         After the game, Dixon said: ''I'm looking forward to the future of Army basketball. They have accomplished too much to feel bad about this season.''         Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt said she was impressed by Dixon's work. ''You love the game and you love to teach the game, which she did very well,'' Summitt said.         Margaret Mary Dixon was born May 9, 1977, in North Hollywood, Calif., and grew up there. At the University of San Diego, the 5-foot-11 Dixon won four varsity letters in basketball and was the captain her senior year. She graduated with a degree in history in 1999. In May 2000, she was cut by the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and later talked her way into an assistant's job at DePaul.         In addition to her brother, Dixon is survived by her parents, Jim and Marge Dixon of North Hollywood, and a sister, Julie.         Cara Enright, a guard on Dixon's team, said yesterday: ''I just loved the energy that Coach brought to practice every day and the way she never gave up on us, always believed in us. She would tell us to use what you've learned here at the academy and apply it to basketball.''       
         Carolyn Shaw Bell, an economist at Wellesley College who took her fight for equal opportunities for women in economics from the college into the national arena, died May 13 at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 85.         Mary Ann Hill, a college spokeswoman, announced Dr. Bell's death.         Dr. Bell started her work at Wellesley in 1950. By 1995, an article in The New York Times pointed to the ''Wellesley effect,'' a disproportionately large number of graduates of Wellesley, a women's college, in executive suites and corporate boardrooms. It said the college's alumnae had long been overrepresented at Harvard Business School and said part of the reason was the dynamic teaching of Dr. Bell.         Dr. Bell carried her equality campaign to the American Economic Association, where she was a founder of the group's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. In 1998, the committee established the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award for the person who has most advanced women in the profession.         Her own scholarship focused on human capital, income distribution and the quality of economic data. She wrote two books, ''Consumer Choice in the American Economy'' (1967) and ''The Economics of the Ghetto'' (1970).         In 1973, she was appointed an overseer of the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College, the first woman appointed to any governing board there.         She advised the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter and was rumored to be in consideration for a high economic post in his administration that never materialized.         She deeply influenced distinguished students like Alicia Munnell, an assistant secretary of the treasury and member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration and now a professor at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College. Professor Munnell recounted last week how Dr. Bell's help continued through correspondence and networking for many years after graduation.         ''It was just to make sure that the students she came into contact with knew they could do anything they wanted to, and that she was behind them pushing and applauding all the way,'' Professor Munnell said.         Dr. Bell coined the term ''FEMS,'' for female economics majors, to describe her students and former students. Carolyn Shaw was born on June 21, 1920, in Framingham, Mass. She majored in economics at Mount Holyoke College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated magna cum laude.         She then worked at the Office of Price Administration, which was established during World War II to prevent inflation and was led by John Kenneth Galbraith, who later helped Dr. Bell create the committee of female economists. In 1949, she earned a doctorate at the London School of Economics.         At her retirement in 1989, she held the Katharine Coman chair in economics at Wellesley and had been departmental chairwoman twice.         Dr. Bell had moved to Arlington after living for many years in Lexington, Mass., and, previously, in Dover, Mass.         Her husband, Nelson Sibly Bell, died in 1991. She is survived by her daughter, Tova Maria Solo of Arlington, and one grandson.       
         Barbara Epstein, a founder and co-editor of The New York Review of Books and a figure at the center of New York literary life for decades, died yesterday in the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in which she had lived for more than 50 years. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her son, Jacob, said. He added that his mother, whose cancer was diagnosed in September 2005, was in her office as recently as two and a half weeks ago.         For much of her career, Ms. Epstein was famous for being part of a tandem. During the 1950's and 60's, she and her husband at the time, Jason, were the first couple of publishing, powerful book editors who knew everyone and gave the kind of high-octane dinner parties that warranted mention in Edmund Wilson's journals.         With Robert Silvers, her co-editor at The New York Review, she had an office partnership that endured even longer than her marriage, which ended in divorce in 1980.         ''Barbara was one of the most influential editors of our time,'' the writer Janet Malcolm said. ''But she had none of the qualities -- aggressiveness, ruthlessness, egotism -- that are commonly associated with powerful editors. Barbara's uncommon modesty, gentleness and charm were the source of a certain mysteriousness. They were also, of course, entirely of a piece with the magazine she and Bob Silvers put out.''         Ms. Epstein was born Barbara Zimmerman, the younger of two sisters, in Boston in 1928. Her father sold textiles and her mother was a homemaker. She attended Girls Latin School and graduated in 1949 from Radcliffe.         She began her editorial career as an assistant at Doubleday, then quickly rose to prominence there as the editor of Anne Frank's ''Diary of a Young Girl,'' among other books. She went on to work at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and The Partisan Review. In 1954 she married Mr. Epstein. Their children, Jacob, of Los Angeles, and Helen, of Brooklyn, survive her, as do three grandchildren.         It was at the Epsteins' dinner table, during the winter of 1962, that the idea for The New York Review of Books was hatched. New York's daily newspapers were on strike, and the absence of The New York Times Book Review had stranded publishers with no place to advertise their books and authors with no place for their work to be written about. To fill the vacuum, Mr. and Mrs. Epstein, together with Robert Lowell and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, who were guests that evening, decided to put out a book review of their own. ''Jason was, like, 'Kids, let's put on a show,' '' Ms. Epstein recalled.         The strike ended in February, but The Review, which had by then come out twice, was so successful that Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers, who had been recruited as co-editor, decided to keep it going. It became one of the most influential and admired journals of its kind, attracting a high-powered roster of writers. The books reviewed and those who reviewed them were all carefully hand picked, causing many to view the magazine as a kind of private club.         Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers made an unusual literary tag team. He is large and formidable. She was small, friendly and enthusiastic. They informally divided the literary turf between them. Mr. Silvers claimed history, politics, science and art history; Ms. Epstein looked after the arts and more literary books. But philosophically they saw eye to eye.         ''We were such close partners in the way of sharing every commission, every manuscript, every decision,'' Mr. Silvers said yesterday. Ms. Epstein, he said, read every manuscript that made it into The Review.         The poet James Fenton said: ''The system was always that whichever was actually editing you, the other was always checking in. Nothing was done by one without the participation of the other.''         Ms. Epstein was famous for putting articles though multiple revisions if necessary, sending out what were known as the A, B, C and sometimes the D and E proofs. ''She was the fiercest editor,'' the writer Diane Johnson, a close friend, recalled. ''Very much the perfectionist, but in a very sympathetic way.''         And she was arguably the more fun-loving of The New York Review's ruling pair, reliably turning up at book parties, no matter how obscure, except on evenings when she was giving her own. Her companion of many years after her divorce was the columnist Murray Kempton, who died in 1997.         ''She loved Champagne,'' the writer Nora Ephron recalled, ''and she herself had this quality that was so fizzy and festive, with such an appetite for trivia and gossip, that you completely forgot she was the editor of The New York Review.''       
         Evelyn Dubrow, organized labor's most prominent lobbyist at the time of its greatest power in her four decades with the nation's largest apparel union, died on Tuesday in Washington. Family members said she was 95.         She died at George Washington Hospital after several days in a coma, said Jay Mazur, former president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, now part of Unite Here.         Just 4 feet 11 inches tall and famed for working 15-hour days, Ms. Dubrow was one of the most colorful and respected lobbyists in Washington, and one of the first powerful women among them. One fellow lobbyist called her ''the little engine that could.''         Sometimes she visited 30 senators in a day. She said she trudged so many miles around Capitol Hill that she wore out 24 pairs of her Size 4 shoes each year.         David Dubinsky, the legendary president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, named Ms. Dubrow the union's chief Washington lobbyist in 1956, once saying that she was the girl who should represent all the girls in the union.         Tireless and an eloquent speaker, she was a powerful voice for labor and for social legislation, including Medicare, school spending and civil rights.         At a signing ceremony in 1965 for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, President Lyndon B. Johnson singled out Ms. Dubrow, saying she deserved credit for pushing through the legislation.         Although he was just as conservative as Ms. Dubrow was liberal, Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate in 1964, was friendly with Ms. Dubrow, once telling Mr. Dubinsky, ''That's a smart little girl lawyer you've got down here.'' She was not a lawyer, however.         She was so well liked and such a fixture on Capitol Hill that House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. assigned her a chair among the Congressional doorkeepers' chairs outside the House of Representatives so she would not have to stand all day while waiting to buttonhole arriving or departing House members. She was the only lobbyist to have such a seat.         ''Lobbyists tend to work for, or even become, fat cats,'' Ms. Dubrow said in a 1997 interview with Washingtonian Magazine. ''Well, I'm not. And I don't. I work for more than 350,000 union members and 250,000 retirees. They're far from fat cats. They're hard-working citizens who can't trot up to Capitol Hill and meet their representatives directly.''         She worked in Washington under presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower through Bill Clinton. She won many battles, like raising the federal minimum wage to $1.15 an hour in 1961. But she often lost, failing, for example, to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement under Mr. Clinton.         When Mr. Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999 -- he towered over her as they hugged -- he said, ''A tenacious and effective union activist, she has been a force for social justice and improved labor conditions by working for increases in the minimum wage, health care reform, family and medical leave, and pay equity for women.''         In Ms. Dubrow's early years as a lobbyist, some senators asked her to baby-sit, among them the fathers of Al Gore, the former vice president, and Christopher J. Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut.         She did not hide her disappointment that Republicans took control of Congress in the 1990's.         ''What most bothers me in this Republican Congress is how they make it seem a crime for anyone to be poor -- like the poor want to be poor,'' she said in a Washingtonian interview. ''Some of those folks on the Hill can't get it through their thick heads that as representatives in a democracy, they should care about the people who most need their help.''         Evelyn Dubrow -- known universally as Evy -- was born in Passaic, N.J., on March 6, 1911, relatives said; she left no immediate survivors. She graduated from New York University in the 1930's, having studied journalism there; she sometimes fudged dates to hide her age. She worked as a reporter for The Morning Call of Paterson, N.J.         Ms. Dubrow became secretary for the Textile Workers Union in New Jersey in the late 1930's and then assistant to the president of the state's C.I.O. council.         She said it was no surprise that she became active in labor and politics because her father, a carpenter, was a union man and Socialist Ã©migrÃ© from Belarus while an older sister was once arrested in a suffragists' protest in front of the White House.         In 1948, she became New York State director for Americans for Democratic Action. She twice campaigned for Adlai E. Stevenson, who lost twice to Eisenhower, and afterward she became the garment workers' Washington lobbyist.         She attributed her lobbying success to what she called her BAT theory: ''I don't beg,'' she said. ''I don't assume I know all the answers, and I don't threaten.'' She explained that if lawmakers voted against labor's position, it was unwise to grow angry or threaten to defeat them because then they might never support labor again on any issue.         ''I've always told people, you need better feet than brains to lobby,'' she told Women's Wear Daily in 1988, adding that a sense of humor, a smile and a nonthreatening manner helped, too.         ''I have a theory,'' she added. ''I don't wear pants. Some men don't like women in pants.''       
         Martha E. Peterson, the president of Barnard College in the turbulent Vietnam War era who went on hold the same position at Beloit College, died last Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 90.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said Ron Nief, a spokesman for Beloit, in Wisconsin.         Miss Peterson, as she preferred to be called, was known for fostering calm at Barnard's campus in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan during the late 1960's and early 70's, when student demonstrations roiled at the neighboring campus of Columbia University.         Miss Peterson, who was president of Barnard from 1967 to 1975, said shortly after her appointment: ''I'm not alarmed by student demonstrations. We better try to build bridges of understanding.''         At Beloit, where she was president from 1975 to 1981, Miss Peterson was credited with restoring fiscal stability when enrollment and the endowment were shrinking.         Martha Elizabeth Peterson was born on June 22, 1916, outside Jamestown, Kan., the only child of a wheat farmer and a news reporter. She graduated from the University of Kansas in 1937.         After teaching high school mathematics for several years, she returned to the University of Kansas and earned a master's degree in educational psychology in 1943.         Three years later, after teaching mathematics at the university, Miss Peterson was named assistant dean of women. In 1952, she was promoted to dean of women, and five years later was appointed to a similar post at the University of Wisconsin. In 1959, Miss Peterson completed her doctorate in educational psychology at Kansas.         In May 1967, Miss Peterson was chosen the seventh president of Barnard.         Dorothy Urman Denburg, the current dean of Barnard, was a student government officer during the antiwar protests, during which more than 100 Barnard students were arrested.         ''The campus came to a grinding halt,'' Dean Denburg recalled. ''Martha convened the entire college community -- faculty and students -- in one of the largest rooms on campus to talk about what the college's response should be. The outcome was a series of compromises giving students options for completing their academic work.''         In Miss Peterson's estimation, she once told a reporter, her most significant achievement was working out an arrangement between Barnard and Columbia that allowed students at both colleges to take an unlimited number of courses at the other school while retaining Barnard's autonomy.         Desiring to return to her Midwest roots, she took the job of president of Beloit. She helped improve the school's economic situation by selling off parts of the campus and cutting the staff.         Beloit's current president, John E. Burris, said that Miss Peterson's ''down-to-earth style, mixed with congenial good humor, worked well for Beloit at a time when severe personnel and fiscal decisions were necessary.''         Miss Peterson is survived by her companion, Dr. Maxine Bennett.       
         Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German-born soprano whose interpretations of Strauss and Mozart made her one of the most dazzling artists of her time, died yesterday at her home in Austria. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Austrian state television. Citing a funeral home director, the broadcaster, ORF, said Miss Schwarzkopf had died in the town of Schruns in Austria's westernmost province, Vorarlberg. No cause of death was given.         To her legions of admirers, Miss Schwarzkopf was a peerless interpreter of Strauss's Marschallin, Mozart's Donna Elvira and other operatic roles. But her image was tarnished in her later years by revelations that she had lied about the extent of her association with the Nazis during World War II.         Not only had she performed for the Nazis, it was learned, but she had also been a member of the party. In her defense, she said that for an artist needing work, joining the party had been ''akin to joining a union.''         For a singer of such unquestionable stature, Miss Schwarzkopf's work was controversial. In her prime, she possessed a radiant lyric soprano voice, impressive technical agility and exceptional understanding of style. From the 1950's until the 1970's, she was for many listeners the high priestess of the lieder recital, a sublime artist who brought textual nuance, interpretive subtlety and elegant musicianship to her work.         But others found her interpretations calculated, mannered and arch (the ''Prussian perfectionist,'' one critic called her), and complained that in trying to add textual vitality, Miss Schwarzkopf resorted to crooning and half-spoken dramatic effects.         Connoisseurs and critics could be surprisingly divided about her basic vocal gifts.         Will Crutchfield, reviewing some live recordings of Miss Schwarzkopf in recital, wrote in The New York Times in 1990: ''It was always clear that she had a superior voice (a smooth, glamorous lyric soprano) and superior technical command.'' Yet Peter G. Davis, writing in The Times in 1981, described her career as ''a triumph of intelligence and willpower over what was basically an unremarkable voice.''         The consensus, however, was that in roles like the Marschallin and other Strauss heroines (Ariadne in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' the countess in ''Capriccio''), as well as Mozart's Fiordiligi and Countess Almaviva and Wagner's Eva and Elsa, she could sing incomparably, with shimmering tone and richness and charismatic presence.         She was an uncommonly beautiful woman, despite a visible gap between her two front teeth that she never bothered to correct, with light hair and deep-set gray eyes. For a time in her younger years she pursued a career as a film actress and might have succeeded had she continued.         A hard-working, self-challenging singer, she performed 74 roles in 53 operas, including Anne Trulove in the world premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress'' in Venice in 1951. Her lieder repertory included hundreds of songs by Schubert, Schumann, Mozart and Strauss, and she was a pioneering champion of the songs of Hugo Wolf, which she sang with insight and affecting beauty.         Olga Maria Elisabeth Frederike Schwarzkopf was born on Dec. 9, 1915, in Jarotschin, Germany, in what is now west-central Poland. Both her parents were Prussian. Friedrich Schwarzkopf, her father, a classics schoolmaster, was an easygoing intellectual. Her mother, the former Elisabeth Frohling, was an efficient homemaker who took charge of her adored only child's education and budding musical career.         Friedrich Schwarzkopf's work as a teacher necessitated that the family move several times. When Elisabeth was 13, they settled in Magdeburg, Germany, where she studied piano, guitar, viola and organ and developed a naturally high, light voice that kept her in demand for concerts at school and local amateur performances.         The family moved to Berlin in 1933, the year Hitler came to power. Miss Schwarzkopf attended the Berlin Royal Augusta School and later won admission to the Hochschule fÃ¼r Musik. In 1934, before beginning her formal training, she won a grant from the League of National Socialist Students for a cycling and camping trip to England, where she learned English. She retained a fondness for the country, which after the war embraced her as an artist and made her a Dame of the British Empire in 1992.         At the music school, students were required to attend daily lectures on Hitler's National Socialist movement, and in 1935, when she was nearly 20, Miss Schwarzkopf joined the student association of the National Socialist Party. Alan Jefferson, a Schwarzkopf biographer, said she became fÃ¼hrerin of the student organization and that one of her responsibilities as ideological leader was to ''keep an eye on other students.''         Her teacher at the Hochschule fÃ¼r Musik, Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, though distinguished in her field, inexplicably believed that Miss Schwarzkopf should be a contralto. It was not until after her formal training, in 1938, when she began singing with the Berlin State Opera, that Miss Schwarzkopf came into her own vocally.         During this time she gained a reputation as a singer fiercely determined to leap from the small roles typically assigned a newcomer into substantive parts. The director of the company, Wilhelm Rode, had won the favor of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One reason Miss Schwarzkopf later gave for cooperating with the Nazis was that it was incumbent on aspiring singers in the company to support the party.         But until the 1980's, she maintained that she had never officially joined the Nazi Party. She denied having done so in three Allied questionnaires in 1945, a time during the occupation when former party members were usually barred from public performance in Germany.         In 1982, however, a music historian at the University of Vienna, Oliver Rathkolb, published a doctoral dissertation that revealed details of her party membership. The information had come from documents discovered in the Allied Denazification Bureau in Vienna and subsequently moved to the National Archives in Washington.         According to these records, Miss Schwarzkopf applied for membership on Jan. 26, 1940, and was accepted on March 1 of that year, becoming Nazi member No. 7548960. Scholars and authors have since placed her application for party membership even earlier.         In an interview with The Times in 1983, Miss Schwarzkopf denied she had been a party member. But when told of these documents by The Times, she admitted that she had joined the party. ''We thought nothing of it,'' she said. ''We just did it.'' In a letter to The Times, she expanded on her explanation: ''It was akin to joining a union, and exactly for the same reason: to have a job.''         In other interviews, she quoted in her defense the first line of Tosca's famous aria: ''Vissi d'arte,'' which translates, ''I lived for art.''         Discussion of her Nazi past re-emerged briefly in connection with tributes to her on her 80th birthday. Mr. Jefferson's biography, ''Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,'' which came out at the time, raised debate about her wartime role, depicting her as an ambitious singer who was focused on furthering her career.         As a Nazi, Miss Schwarzkopf gave performances at party functions and sang for Waffen SS troops at the front. Some researchers believe she became a member of Goebbels's Reichstheaterkammer, working in the propaganda ministry and appearing insome films.         Still, if she had hoped that party affiliation would quickly advance her career at the Berlin State Opera, it did not work as planned. She was still expected to sing, sometimes nightly, bit roles in ''Carmen,'' ''Die Fledermaus'' and frothy operettas.         Her breakthrough came with the dauntingly difficult coloratura role of Zerbinetta in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' which she first sang in late 1940. Her performance won the attention of Maria IvogÃ¼n, a noted exponent of the role. Miss IvogÃ¼n was so impressed, she took on Miss Schwarzkopf as a private student, coaching her in the high soprano repertory, and training her as a lieder singer. Miss Schwarzkopf was soon engaged by the Vienna State Opera.         She realized that her future lay with the lyric soprano repertory. Engagements followed at the first postwar Salzburg Festival in 1947, where she worked with the conductor Wilhelm FurtwÃ¤ngler, and in subsequent summers, when she formed a close working relationship with the conductor Herbert von Karajan. She also toured with the Vienna State Opera in 1947, traveling to London, where she performed in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Fidelio'' at Covent Garden.         The London performances were an enormous success, and she was invited to join the newly founded Covent Garden company. She sang with the company for the next five years, performing not just her German repertory but also Violetta, Mimi, Gilda, and Massenet's Manon, all in English.         Her career and repertory choices were now being shaped by Walter Legge, then a music administrator and critic. Born in London in 1906, Legge had no formal training in music but was musically astute. He had been an assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham and was largely responsible for forming the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus.         After the war, Legge worked mainly for recording companies. It was during a scouting trip to Vienna in search of new talent for EMI Records that the severe-looking, bespectacled Legge first heard Miss Schwarzkopf in an audition. Thus began an artistic partnership that grew into a life partnership. Legge, then divorced from his first wife, Nancy Evans, a mezzo-soprano, married Miss Schwarzkopf in 1953.         Opinion is divided about the effect Legge had on Miss Schwarzkopf as an artist. He tended to treat her as a musical and intellectual inferior. He was capable of berating her in public when she failed to meet his approval.         But he introduced her to a wealth of repertory, especially the songs of Hugo Wolf, and as artistic director of EMI Records, he supervised her recordings, coaching her in detail and ensuring that the engineers captured her voice at its best. Given Miss Schwarzkopf's association with the Nazis, there was some trepidation about launching her American career. Her debut in the United States was delayed until October 1953, but that performance, a single sold-out song recital at Town Hall in New York, captivated the critics.         This was followed in late 1954 by an American tour, which ended back at Town Hall. A critic for Musical America wrote that Miss Schwarzkopf's singing at Town Hall had ''displayed the exquisite finish, technical mastery and interpretive felicity that had marked her debut recital here last season.''         In the fall of 1956 she sang a recital at Carnegie Hall. It was the first time the hall had ever been sold out for a program of German lieder.         Miss Schwarzkopf's American operatic debut came in 1955 with the San Francisco Opera as the Marschallin. Mildred Norton, a critic for The Saturday Review, reported that a capacity audience had saluted a ''memorable new Princess Werdenberg.'' Miss Schwarzkopf, she wrote, was ''a poised and vibrant new personality with a vocal radiance and a personal grace.''         Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera did not occur until October 1964, again as the Marschallin. Though Raymond Erickson, a critic for The Times, noted less freshness and bloom in Miss Schwarzkopf's voice (she was nearly 49), he said she had ''conquered her listeners, and the roar that filled the house when she took her bows must be the kind that the most vain prima donna could ask for.''         Outside the Metropolitan Opera House, there were scattered protests over her wartime career, and Miss Schwarzkopf had a chilly relationship with the Met's general manager Rudolf Bing, an Austrian-born Jew. Besides her six performances of the Marschallin that debut season, she sang only one more time at the Met, a Donna Elvira in 1966.         But she performed frequently in New York in recital and with orchestras and continued to win devoted admirers around the world. Many of her EMI recordings became immediate classics. Among them were her Mozart song album with the pianist Walter Gieseking and her Schubert song album with the pianist Edwin Fischer, both recorded in 1952; her 1957 recording of ''Rosenkavalier,'' conducted by Karajan, and, one of her finest achievements, her 1959 recording of ''Capriccio,'' conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.         As her career slowed, she began giving master classes, usually teaming with Legge, gaining a reputation as an insightful but almost impossibly exacting coach. In 1977-78, she embarked on a swan song recital tour, mostly accompanied by the pianist Geoffrey Parsons, who was her partner for her official farewell recital in Zurich on March 19, 1979. Two days later, Legge, who had become embittered that his talents were no longer sought by recording companies, died of a heart attack at 72.         Miss Schwarzkopf leaves no immediate survivors. Asked once whether she regretted having had no children, she replied, ''I have 500 children, the songs I sing.''         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A photograph with an obituary yesterday about the renowned soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who died Thursday in Austria at age 90, was published in error. The picture, supplied by the Salzburg Festival, showed Anneliese Rothenberger, not Miss Schwarzkopf, in the role of Sophie from a 1962 film adaptation of Richard Strauss's opera ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' Miss Schwarzkopf played the Marschallin in that production, which the festival had staged for the film. The Marschallin was a signature role for Miss Schwarzkopf, who performed it, above, in 1959 at Covent Garden in London.         (Photo by Evening Standard/Getty Images)         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was published in error. It showed Anneliese Rothenberger -- not Miss Schwarzkopf -- in the role of Sophie from ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' a 1962 film adaptation of the Richard Strauss opera. The Salzburg Festival mounted that production, in which Miss Schwarzkopf had the role of the Marschallin, and originally distributed the photograph with the incorrect information. A picture of Miss Schwarzkopf appears today on Page C10.         The obituary also misspelled the surname of a music critic for The New York Times who reviewed Miss Schwarzkopf's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1964. He was Raymond Ericson, not Erickson.         Correction:  August 10, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Friday of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf referred incorrectly to her birthplace in some copies. When she was born in 1915, the town was Jarotschin, Germany, not Jarocin, and it was not ''near Poland;'' Poland did not exist then as an independent nation. Since 1918 the town has been Jarocin, Poland.       
         Lydia, Duchess of Bedford, an English aristocrat who helped transform Woburn Abbey, her second husband's ancestral home in Bedfordshire, into a pioneering and satisfyingly lucrative example of blueblood tourism, died July 25 in Chertsey, Surrey, England. She was 88.         Her death came after she was injured in a fall, said Paul de Fraine, personal assistant to the present duke.         After inheriting Woburn Abbey in 1953, with its staggering estate taxes and annual heating bills of $14,000, Ian Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford, a former newspaper reporter and rent collector, decided to make the dilapidated property pay for itself by reinventing it as a tourist attraction. It was not easy; half the building had been demolished because of dry rot.         The estate, with more than 10,000 acres of land, had been in the Russell family since 1547, and when the new duke and duchess, who had been farming in South Africa, were called home to do their dynastic duty, they literally rolled up their sleeves and washed antique porcelain dinner services and dusted off the paintings by Canaletto, Landseer and Van Dyck.         Six months of cleaning later, Woburn Abbey's doors were opened to the public in 1954. The entrance fee was a half-crown, about 35 cents; it is now Â£10.50, about $20.         Some of the couple's noble friends were horrified at additions that they considered shocking intrusions of show business: in addition to snack bars and sailboat rentals, there was a children's zoo with a skunk named Jasmine. More startling stunts were to come. The property eventually developed a safari park with lions, giraffes and Barbary apes. Marilyn Monroe was invited to sleep in one of the historic beds.         However, many members of the nobility tried to follow the example of the duke and duchess when it became clear that the newly enlivened Woburn Abbey was a moneymaker.         In the first five months of 1957, according to an article in The New York Times, 373,000 tourists visited the property, paying more than $200,000 toward the upkeep of the estate.         The estate is now managed by the duke's grandson Andrew Russell, 15th Duke of Bedford. Today, it incorporates three award-winning golf courses, an inn, a stud farm, an antiques center and a restaurant housed in a Tudor-style half-timbered building that was displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.         Born in 1917 as the Hon. Lydia Yarde-Buller, the duchess was a member of a family whose genealogical tentacles connected her to an array of notables, including Sir Walter Raleigh, Robert E. Lee, Olivia de Havilland and President Benjamin Harrison. Her father, John Yarde-Buller, the third Baron Churston, was a military officer who served in the Boer War. Her mother, Jessie Smither, was one of Edwardian London's most alluring musical comedy stars, performing under the stage name Denise Orme. Adding further exotic gloss to the Yarde-Buller clan was the duchess's sister Joan, who married the playboy Prince Aly Khan, converted to Islam and adopted the name Princess Tajuldowlah.         The duchess married her first husband, Capt. Ian Archibald de Hoghton Lyle, heir to a baronetcy, in 1938; he was killed in action four years later. She married the Duke of Bedford in 1947, about a year after the suicide of his first wife, when he was still the Marquess of Tavistock. They divorced in 1960 because of the duke's affair with the French television producer Nicole Milinaire, who became his third and last wife.         Lydia, Duchess of Bedford (who kept her title after the divorce, with the customary addition of her first name to avoid confusion with her husband's new wife) is survived by two sons, Sir Gavin Lyle, third baronet, of Murthly, Perth, Scotland, and Lord Francis Russell of London; a daughter, Lorna Alexander of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland; a stepson, Lord Rudolf Russell, also of London; and nephews and nieces who include Aga Khan IV, the 49th imam of the Shiite Imami Ismaili Muslims, who lives in Paris.       
         Marie Tharp, an oceanographic cartographer whose work in the 1950's, 60's and 70's helped throw into relief -- literally -- the largely uncharted landscape of the world's ocean floor, died on Wednesday in Nyack, N.Y. She was 86 and a resident of South Nyack.         The cause was cancer, according to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, which announced the death. Ms. Tharp was a researcher at the observatory from 1948 until her retirement in 1982.         With her colleague Bruce C. Heezen (pronounced HAY-zen), Ms. Tharp compiled the first comprehensive map of the entire ocean bottom, illuminating a hidden world of rifts and valleys, volcanic ranges stretching for thousands of miles and mountain peaks taller than Everest. The map was published by the Office of Naval Research in 1977.         In the revised edition of his book ''The Mapmakers'' (Knopf, 2000), John Noble Wilford, a science reporter for The New York Times, described their achievement this way: ''Like other pioneering maps, the one by Heezen and Tharp is not complete and not always completely accurate. It is, nonetheless, one of the most remarkable achievements in modern cartography. It is the graphic summary of more than a century of oceanographic effort.''         Ms. Tharp's work in plotting the ocean's bottom would also help gain acceptance for the theory of continental drift, still a fairly subversive proposition when she and Mr. Heezen began their collaboration in the late 1940's.         Marie Tharp was born in Ypsilanti, Mich., on July 30, 1920, into a mapping family. Her father, William Edgar Tharp, was a soil surveyor for the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Tharps moved wherever his work took him. Ms. Tharp once estimated that by the time she graduated from high school, she had attended two dozen public schools across the country.         She received a bachelor's degree in English and music from Ohio University in 1943, followed the next year by a master's degree in geology from the University of Michigan. While working as a geologist for an oil company in Oklahoma, Ms. Tharp earned a degree in mathematics from the University of Tulsa in 1948.         That year, she joined Columbia's geology department as a research assistant to the eminent scientist Maurice Ewing. Mr. Heezen, who went on to become a leading geologist and oceanographer, was a graduate student there, and he and Ms. Tharp would share their professional and personal lives for the next three decades.         Before the mid-20th century, little was known about the ocean bottom. Many scientists regarded it as a mostly flat, dull expanse whose principal function was to act as a plinth for the masses of water on top of it. There were some mountains down there -- that much was known -- but no one was certain if they were isolated anomalies or part of a larger geologic system.         In 1949, Mr. Ewing and his team moved their base of operations to the newly opened Lamont Geological Observatory (now the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), in Palisades, N.Y. There, they embarked on a quest to map the sea floor using sonar soundings. Because a research vessel was considered no fit place for a woman, Ms. Tharp, working with pen, ruler and what turned out to be a dangerous bottle of India ink, plotted the data back in Palisades.         She noticed something striking. Charting the soundings in 1953, she observed what seemed to be a depression in the mid-Atlantic Ridge, a volcanic chain that traverses the ocean from north to south. She wondered whether the depression was evidence of a continuous rift -- a crack in the world -- down the middle of the ridge. And she wondered in turn whether that rift might be evidence of what scientists now call seafloor spreading, popularly known as continental drift.         She and Mr. Heezen argued about it. She threw erasers and bottles of ink at him. It took him some time to come around.         ''I discounted it as girl talk and didn't believe it for a year,'' Mr. Heezen later said in an interview.         Over time, Ms. Tharp's hunch was proved correct. Her work with Mr. Heezen, along with the work of other scientists, helped establish the existence of a continuous belt of undersea mountains girdling the earth, with a rift down the center of it.         ''It was only in the early 60's that the marine scientists around the world started putting the pieces of the puzzle together and understanding that these huge volcanic mountain chains were actually where seafloor spreading was taking place,'' Michael Purdy, the director of the Lamont-Doherty observatory, said in a telephone interview yesterday.         Like many women of her era in science, Ms. Tharp was recognized mainly late in life. In 1997, she was honored by the Library of Congress as part of the 100th anniversary of its geography and map division. A fellowship at Lamont-Doherty to promote women in science now bears her name.         The boys finally let her onto the boat, and in her later years, Ms. Tharp sailed the seas, plotting them.         Ms. Tharp leaves no immediate survivors. Mr. Heezen died aboard a submarine, apparently of a heart attack, in 1977.         Of all the waters Ms. Tharp plotted, she found the Atlantic the most congenial. ''It's such a nice symmetrical ocean,'' she told The New York Times in 1991. ''I felt sorry for the people who had to do the Pacific -- it was so much more complicated.''       
         Alice Stone Ilchman, an economist and political scientist who was president of Sarah Lawrence College for nearly 20 years, died on Friday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said Judith Schwartzstein, a spokeswoman for the college, which is in Bronxville.         The eighth president of Sarah Lawrence, Ms. Ilchman (pronounced ILTSCH-man) was also its longest serving, holding the post from 1981 until 1998. She was previously an assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in the administration of President Jimmy Carter.         At her death, Ms. Ilchman was the director of the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship of the Thomas J. Watson Foundation. From 1995 to 2000, she was chairwoman of the Rockefeller Foundation.         Alice Stone was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1935. Her father, Donald Crawford Stone, was an educator and federal planner in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. She earned a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke in 1957; a master's from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1958; and a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics in 1965. She married Warren F. Ilchman in 1960.         After earning her doctorate, Ms. Ilchman directed the Peace Corps training program for India and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. She later taught economics at Wellesley, where she was Dean of the College         During Ms. Ilchman's tenure at Sarah Lawrence, the college's endowment grew from $3 million to $30 million. She oversaw the construction of two new buildings, including a science center, which was named for her this May.         Besides her husband, a former president of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn who is now the director of the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, Ms. Ilchman is survived by a son, Frederick, of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Hollinger of New York; two sisters, Nancy Dickinson of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Stone of Los Angeles; and a brother, Donald C. Stone Jr. of Oakland, Calif.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 and also had a home in Southampton, N.Y.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Athletic, lithe and as poised as a princess, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         The marriage, in 1954, was the stuff of newsreels: some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.         The sixth of nine children born to Joseph Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mrs. Lawford, like her siblings, had a well-honed understanding of politics and of the power of appearances. As early as 1946, she campaigned for her brother John during his first run for Congress, organizing highly effective women's coffees in Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods. When he ran for president in 1960, she often substituted at events for his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, who was pregnant.         The Lawfords strengthened John Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with the ''Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Mr. Sinatra threw his support behind Kennedy, and his hit song ''High Hopes,'' with lyrics by Sammy Cahn, became the Kennedy campaign song. At the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, Mr. Lawford and Ms. MacLaine helped lead the singing of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce. It was a highly publicized break, one that required Mrs. Lawford to establish residency in Idaho to circumvent New York's divorce laws of the time.         Afterward, Mrs. Lawford and her four children moved to New York, where she took on a busy social schedule, befriended artists and writers and became known as a generous benefactor of the arts. She was a familiar presence at benefit dinners, and her patronage would increase the cachet of any fund-raising event. Her name appeared regularly in the society columns of New York, the Hamptons and Palm Beach, Fla.         Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives.         In the 1930's, while her father was ambassador to Britain, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, a boarding school for girls on the outskirts of London. When her family moved to Bronxville, N.Y., she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school in the Maplehurst section of the Bronx. (It later moved to Greenwich, Conn.) She attended Rosemont College in Pennsylvania, graduating in 1945.         Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother. She was an accomplished athlete, but she never caught the family's legendary fire for competition.         In her 1987 book, ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote that Rose Kennedy was bothered by Patricia's lack of ambition. ''Although she had a good mind, a fine physique and a beautiful face which could easily have led her to excel in school,'' Ms. Goodwin wrote, ''in sports or in appearance, Rose contended 'she would never make the effort to achieve distinction' in any of these areas.''         But Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher Lawford, wrote in his best-selling memoir, ''Symptoms of Withdrawal,'' published last year, that his mother had been resentful of her father for ''not being allowed fully to live up to her potential.''         In college she directed and acted in theater productions, and she pursued those interests after graduation, going to work as an assistant in the New York production department of NBC. She moved to Los Angeles to work as an assistant for Kate Smith's radio show and later for ''Family Theater,'' the radio program produced by the Rev. Patrick Peyton.         Much like her older sister Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to rear their children as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York. She and Mr. Lawford settled into a sprawling oceanfront home in California once owned by Louis B. Mayer. The house became a recreation center for other family members; the president spent time lounging at his sister's pool when he was on the West Coast.         After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Mrs. Lawford was often seen in the company of his widow and their two children, Caroline and John Jr. In 1986, she joined Senator Kennedy on an official visit to Chile that was marred by egg-throwing protesters angered by Mr. Kennedy's criticism of President Augusto Pinochet.         Mrs. Lawford devoted her energies to organizations that served the mentally disabled and to those helping people with substance abuse problems. She had a close personal appreciation for both causes: her older sister Rosemary, who died last year, was born mildly retarded and was lobotomized at 23; and she, Mr. Lawford and her son had waged their own battles with drugs and alcohol.         Mrs. Lawford's brother Robert, the former attorney general and later senator from New York, was closest to her in age, just 18 months younger. After his assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lawford assembled a privately printed book of reminiscences about him, as John had done for their oldest brother, Joe, who died in World War II.         The book, ''That Shining Hour,'' was published in 1969. Mrs. Lawford wrote in her introduction: ''This is not a sad book. Bobby was not a sad person. His basic shyness to the outside world gave way to fun, humor and wit whenever he was with the family.''         In addition to her brother Edward, Mrs. Lawford is survived by her son, Christopher, of California; three daughters, Sydney and Victoria Frances, both of Washington, and Robin, of New York; her sisters Jean Kennedy Smith and Eunice Kennedy Shriver; and 10 grandchildren.         In her last years, Mrs. Lawford led a relatively private life. She may have been a Kennedy, a woman with an instantly familiar name, but she did not crave attention and enjoyed walking the streets of Manhattan without being recognized.         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  September 19, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about Patricia Kennedy Lawford, a sister of President John F. Kennedy, misstated the location of her death. It was at her home in Manhattan, not her home in Southampton, N.Y. The article also erroneously included a survivor; her sister Rosemary Kennedy died last year. The obituary also misstated the place of residence of Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher. He lives in California, not New York. A full obituary appears today on page B8.       
         Astrid Varnay, the charismatic dramatic soprano whose distinguished 55-year career began at 23 with a last-minute debut at the Metropolitan Opera, singing the role of Sieglinde in Wagner's ''WalkÃ¼re'' for an indisposed Lotte Lehmann, died in Munich on Monday. She was 88.         The cause was a pericardial infection after a long illness, said the writer Donald Arthur, who collaborated with Ms. Varnay on her autobiography, ''Fifty-Five Years in Five Acts: My Life in Opera'' (2000, Northeastern University Press).         As a Wagnerian soprano, Ms. Varnay never achieved the widespread public recognition of her beloved mentor Kirsten Flagstad or her good friend Birgit Nilsson, who like Ms. Varnay was born in Sweden in 1918. But to opera buffs and insiders, Ms. Varnay was a comparably excellent artist.         Her voice had a remarkable range of colorings, from steely luster in climactic outbursts to dusky mellowness in lyrical phrases. She was an alluring woman and a natural actress who conveyed both tragic dignity and impetuosity. Text and music were one in Ms. Varnay's subtle interpretations.         Her work recently came to public attention again when the Testament label released the first two installments of a complete account of Wagner's ''Ring,'' recorded live at the 1955 Bayreuth Festival in Germany. Ms. Varnay, portraying BrÃ¼nnhilde in ''Die WalkÃ¼re'' and ''Siegfried,'' sings with shimmering intensity and keen dramatic insight.         In a phone interview yesterday, James Levine called Ms. Varnay ''one of the truly unique singers'' and recalled working with her in 1979 when, at 61, she sang the role of the hard-bitten Widow Begbick in John Dexter's gritty production of the Weill-Brecht opera ''The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.''         ''I can't think of anyone else who had a grip on the whole thing the way she did,'' Mr. Levine said. ''She sang from the inside out.'' He added: ''The whole score, everything was in her realization, and the presence and the drama were always in balance with the music.''         Though opera was the family business, Ms. Varnay was a latecomer to singing. Ibolyka Astrid Maria Varnay was born in Stockholm on April 25, 1918, to Hungarian parents. At the time, her mother, Maria Javor, a noted coloratura soprano, and her father, Alexander Varnay, a tenor who became a stage director and producer, were working at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm.         In a story she loved to tell in later life, Ms. Varnay said her mother used the bottom drawer of a dressing table backstage as a makeshift crib for her infant daughter during a performance of Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera.'' The table belonged to the company's prima donna, Flagstad, who watched over the baby.         When Astrid was 4, the Varnay family, in search of opportunities, moved to Buenos Aires and then to New York. Her father, who was working as a director at the Manhattan Opera House, died suddenly in 1924. Her mother married an Italian tenor, and the family settled in Jersey City, where Ms. Varnay was brought up.         She set her sights on becoming a pianist. But her vocal talent was overwhelming and she began serious training at 20, working privately with Hermann Weigert, a coach and assistant conductor at the Met. When she sang an audition for Edward Johnson, then the general manager of the Met, he could not believe that Ms. Varnay, a 22-year-old, had learned 13 daunting soprano roles.         When he needed a Sieglinde at the last minute for a Saturday matinee broadcast performance of ''Die WalkÃ¼re'' on Dec. 6, 1941, he turned to Ms. Varnay, who had not even had a stage rehearsal. Cultural news that weekend was pushed aside by the events of the following day: the attack on Pearl Harbor. Still, the opera world took notice.         The New York Times review reported that the ''exceedingly comely Swedish-American soprano acted with a skill and grace only possible to those with an inborn talent for the theater.''         Six days later, Helen Traubel, scheduled to sing BrÃ¼nnhilde in ''Die WalkÃ¼re,'' took ill and Ms. Varnay, in another last-minute substitution, sang the role, wowing New York audiences and critics.         In 1944 she married her coach, Mr. Weigert, who died in 1955. (Ms. Varnay has no immediate survivors.) Though in the late 1940's she branched into the Italian repertory, at the Met she was known for her Wagner interpretations. She sang around 200 performances with the company.         Still, disagreements with Rudolf Bing, who became the Met's general manager in 1950, led her to concentrate her career in Europe. She became a mainstay of companies in Berlin, Munich and Vienna. She was a particular favorite of Wieland Wagner, Richard Wagner's grandson, who ran the Bayreuth Festival and directed Ms. Varnay in several of his radically abstract and spare productions.         In the late 1960's she gave up her weighty dramatic soprano repertory, which included a chilling portrayal of Strauss's Elektra, and began a ''second career,'' as she called it, singing mezzo-soprano roles and character parts. Mr. Levine said when he asked Ms. Varnay late in her career why she still undertook small roles like Mamma Lucia in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' she told him, '' 'I just love being on stage, seeing up close the work of my younger colleagues.' ''       
         Iva Toguri D'Aquino, the Japanese-American convicted of treason in 1949 for broadcasting propaganda from Japan to United States servicemen in World War II as the seductive but sinister Tokyo Rose, died Tuesday in Chicago.         Mrs. D'Aquino, who served more than six years in prison but steadfastly denied disloyalty and received a presidential pardon in 1977, was 90. Her death, at a Chicago hospital, was confirmed by a nephew, William Toguri, The Associated Press reported.         Tokyo Rose was a mythical figure. The persona, its origin murky, had been bestowed by American servicemen collectively on a dozen or so women who broadcast for Radio Tokyo, telling soldiers, sailors and marines in the Pacific that their cause was lost and that their sweethearts back home were betraying them.         The broadcasts did nothing to dim American morale. The servicemen enjoyed the recordings of American popular music, and the United States Navy bestowed a satirical citation on Tokyo Rose at war's end for her entertainment value.         But the identity of Tokyo Rose became attached to Mrs. D'Aquino, a native of Southern California and the only woman broadcasting for Radio Tokyo known to be an American citizen. She emerged as an infamous figure in a rare treason trial.         Convicted in 1949 by a federal jury in San Francisco on one of eight vaguely worded counts, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. She served six years and two months, then lived quietly in Chicago, running a family gift shop. On Jan. 19, 1977, she was pardoned, without comment, by President Gerald R. Ford on his last full day in office, and her citizenship was restored.         ''A mere wartime myth, Tokyo Rose was to become a disgrace to American justice,'' Edwin O. Reischauer, the American ambassador to Japan from 1961 to 1966 and a scholar at Harvard specializing in East Asian affairs, wrote in his introduction to ''Tokyo Rose: Orphan of the Pacific,'' by Masayo Duus.         The treason charges, Mr. Reischauer wrote, were ''egged on by a public still much under the influence of traditional racial prejudices and far from free of the anti-Japanese hatreds of the recent war.''         Iva Ikuko Toguri was born in Los Angeles on the Fourth of July, 1916, a daughter of Japanese immigrants who owned a grocery store. She graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1940 with a degree in zoology, hoping to become a physician.         In the summer of 1941, she visited an ailing aunt in Tokyo at the request of her mother. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, she was stranded in Tokyo, knowing virtually no Japanese, deprived of a food ration card by the authorities after refusing to become a Japanese citizen and hard pressed to find work.         In 1942, she obtained a job with Japan's Domei news agency, monitoring American military broadcasts, and late in 1943 she became an announcer and disc jockey for Radio Tokyo's propaganda broadcasts, playing American musical recordings on the ''Zero Hour'' program beamed to American servicemen. She called herself Ann or Orphan Ann, short for announcer and a play on the Orphan Annie character.         While continuing to work for Radio Tokyo in 1945, she married Felipe D'Aquino, a Domei news agency employee with Portuguese citizenship and Japanese ancestry.         When the war ended, several American reporters learned of Mrs. D'Aquino's broadcasts and interviewed her in Japan. She said she was Tokyo Rose, evidently presuming no great notoriety would be attached to that and perhaps hoping to embellish an intriguing story for American readers, having been paid for her account in a magazine article.         She subsequently denied ever having called herself Tokyo Rose in her broadcasts, and no evidence was produced to the contrary.         As an outgrowth of the publicity, Mrs. D'Aquino was arrested and questioned by American military occupation authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. United Press quoted her at the time as saying, ''I didn't think I was doing anything disloyal to America.''         In the fall of 1946, Mrs. D'Aquino was released from custody in Japan after the Army and the Justice Department concluded that there were no grounds for prosecuting her. But the Justice Department reopened the case in 1948. Loyalty issues were becoming a national political flash point, although mainly in the context of the cold war, and the American Legion and the powerful columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell had spoken out against Mrs. D'Aquino.         Mrs. D'Aquino, who had unsuccessfully sought permission from the American authorities to return to California, was arrested on charges of treason, transported to San Francisco, held in a county jail for a year, then put on trial in 1949.         Treason, the only crime outlined in detail in the Constitution, is defined as ''levying war'' against the United States or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. A defendant may be convicted only ''on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.''         Up to the end of World War II, there had been only about 30 treason cases in United States history. When Mrs. D'Aquino went on trial, five Americans had been convicted of treason for actions in the war, four having broadcast for Nazi Germany, most notably Mildred Gillars, known as Axis Sally.         Tom DeWolfe, a special assistant attorney general, told the jury that Mrs. D'Aquino had engaged in ''nefarious propagandistic broadcasts'' without being under duress. Former supervisors for Radio Tokyo testified that she had made propaganda broadcasts willingly, and a few broadcast tapes were played for the jury, though none were identified as containing Mrs. D'Aquino's voice.         Testifying at the 12-week trial, Mrs. D'Aquino denied that she had ever made any disloyal statements on Radio Tokyo. She was supported in testimony from former Allied prisoners of war who had worked in the Japanese broadcasting operation. In a statement that she had given to the F.B.I. in Japan and that was entered in the court record, she said that she had sought to reduce the programs' effectiveness as propaganda by inserting double meanings in some of her broadcasts.         Mrs. D'Aquino was convicted on a single count of treason, relating to a broadcast she was alleged to have made to American servicemen in October 1944, referring to the loss of their ships. According to prosecution testimony, she said: ''Orphans of the Pacific, you really are orphans now. How will you get home now that all your ships are lost?''         After serving her sentence at the federal penitentiary for women in Alderson, W.Va., Mrs. D'Aquino fought government efforts to deport her. She ran an Asian grocery store and gift shop on Chicago's North Side that family members had opened after their release from a wartime internment camp in Arizona. Her husband returned to Japan after her trial, and she never saw him again.         President Ford pardoned Mrs. D'Aquino after she appealed to him in writing. The decision was supported by a unanimous vote of the California State Legislature, the national Japanese-American Citizens League, and S. I. Hayakawa, a United States senator-elect from California.         ''It is hard to believe,'' Mrs. D'Aquino said on receiving word of President Ford's action. ''But I have always maintained my innocence -- this pardon is a measure of vindication.''       
         Martha Holmes, a photographer for Life magazine for 40 years, who was known for her intimate portraits but also for covering sports at a time when that was male turf, died on Sept. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The death was confirmed by her son-in-law, John Koshel.         Hired by Life in 1944 when she was 20, Ms. Holmes was one of five women who were photographers at the magazine during its glory decades as the nation's most popular publisher of photography.         She worked in Hollywood, Washington and New York -- for five years on staff and for 35 years as a freelancer -- capturing images of movie stars like Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Van Johnson, Joan Crawford and John Garfield, and of public figures like the union leader John L. Lewis, caught in a scowl, and Eleanor Roosevelt sipping tomato juice.         ''She had a talent for extracting the best from people,'' said Bobbi Burrows, the director of photography for Life Books and an editor at the magazine for 40 years. ''She brought intimacy out of her subjects; people felt they were in good hands.''         Perhaps Ms. Holmes's most famous image is of the abstract painter Jackson Pollock, taken at his home studio in East Hampton, N.Y., for the issue of Aug. 8, 1949. It shows Pollock crouching over a canvas with paint cupped in his right hand, demonstrating his technique for applying an unbroken stream of black enamel, a cigarette dangling from his mouth.         In 1999 the photograph was the model for a 33-cent postage stamp. The Postal Service hired an artist, Howard Koslow, to copy it -- telling him to leave out the dangling cigarette, in the interest of public health.         Another well-known photo by Ms. Holmes, taken in 1947 during the Hollywood blacklist era, shows Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Danny Kaye in the audience at a hearing of the House Un-American Activities Committee, looks of concern on their faces.         Ms. Holmes's son-in-law, Mr. Koshel, said he once showed her the picture and suggested that it was an indication of her political point of view.         ''Martha remarked, 'No, I just saw Bogey was upset,' '' he said.         Martha Louise Holmes was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 7, 1923. Her father, George Holmes, worked in public relations; her mother, Emma Auer Holmes, was a voice coach. Ms. Holmes is survived by two daughters, Anne Waxman of Manhattan and Terry Koshel of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and two grandchildren. Her husband of 46 years, Arthur Waxman, died in 1998.         Ms. Holmes became interested in photography as teenager. She attended the University of Louisville for a year, but then was hired as a photo lab assistant at The Louisville Courier-Journal. Soon after, she was given a three-month trial as a cub photographer.         Two years later a Life photographer noticed her work and recommended that the magazine hire her. One of her first assignments was to cover the Kentucky Derby, where a male photographer shoved her aside. She later said she just elbowed him in the chest.         Ms. Burrows said Ms. Holmes's favorite photo, taken in 1949, is of the jazz singer Billy Eckstine surrounded by grinning female fans, one with her head on his chest.         ''It was groundbreaking back then in that it was a black man hugging a white woman,'' Ms. Burrrows said. ''There was a discussion about whether we should run it or not.'' An editor took the print to Henry R. Luce, Life's publisher, Ms. Burrows said. ''And Mr. Luce said, 'Run it.' ''         In 1953 Ms. Holmes was the subject of a sports-page article in The Louisville Times. Headlined ''Gal Sent to Cover Marciano Camp,'' it tells how she was assigned to shoot the heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano at his training camp at Grossinger's resort in the Catskills. In the article Ms. Holmes tells how an assignment editor at Life looked around, pointed and said, ''You.''         ''Who, me?'' Ms. Holmes recalled saying.         ''Yes, you're a photographer, aren't you?'' the editor said.       
         Michelle Urry, who brought a wicked sense of humor, an uncanny ability to nurture eccentric artists and what she called an ''inordinately dirty mind'' to her position as cartoons editor of Playboy magazine, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was an ocular melanoma, a cancer of the eye, said her daughter-in-law, Justine Rosenthal.         For a generation -- from the early 1970's until her death -- Ms. Urry sorted through more than 1,000 cartoons a week to come up with the couple of dozen or so to appear in the monthly magazine, then sent them on to Hugh Hefner for the final selection. Her taste -- seasoned by a girlhood of reading comic books, the careful study of the history of cartoons and experience as a fashion designer -- helped shape the famous look of Playboy's cartoons.         Brian Walker, curator of a 1984 exhibition of Playboy cartoons at the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., wrote that ''perhaps with the exception of The New Yorker, Playboy has been the only publication to maintain excellence in the field.''         Playboy's cartoons were certainly sexier than The New Yorker's, but they also reflected a cheekier, more anti-establishment sensibility that Mr. Hefner has said presaged and reflected the sexual revolution of the 1960's and 70's. Ms. Urry assembled a worldwide stable of artists who captured this worldview.         In an interview yesterday, Mr. Hefner said that occasionally Ms. Urry would persuade him to use a cartoon he had initially rejected. He also praised her ability to communicate with cartoonists, whose artistic egos often needed massaging.         The cartoonist Jules Feiffer, in another interview yesterday, said Ms. Urry was a ''mother superior to cartoonists.''         Lee Lorenz, the longtime cartoon editor of The New Yorker, recalled the famous poker parties for cartoonists she held in her loft and the cartoonists' Christmas parties at Playboy headquarters. He praised her ability to choose work that reflected Playboy's mission.         Michelle Dorothy Kaplan was born on Dec. 28, 1939, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where her father was a clothing manufacturer. She said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995 that instead of dolls she had a huge comic-book collection. After graduating from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she studied English, she opened a dress shop where she sold her own designs.         She sold the shop and moved to New York, but hated it and moved to Chicago, where a friend suggested she might find design work at Playboy.         Instead, she was offered a secretarial job, which she angrily rejected. A few days later, she was offered a job she remembered as ''an assistant something,'' with the promise that in six months she could be an editor. The job was ''bunny department assistant,'' although she was never a bunny, Ms. Rosenthal said.         Not satisfied, she transferred to answering phones at the Playboy mansion, and eventually Mr. Hefner asked her to be his assistant on cartoons, with the understanding that she might become cartoon editor in a year.         She did, although she said in an interview with The National Observer in 1971 that the job ''had some onus attached to it'': her predecessor had been a girlfriend of Mr. Hefner's, and gossip was inevitable. However, Ms. Urry said, she quickly demonstrated an indisputable knack for the work.         ''The fact that I brought to it an inordinately dirty mind was my own doing -- I mean, I don't think he expected that kind of bonus,'' she said. She also learned that appreciation of humor is almost instinctual. She told The National Observer that when people brought intellect to humor, the enjoyment was lost.         In the 1970's, it was cause for comment that Ms. Urry was working for Playboy despite her outspoken feminist beliefs. But she stoutly defended her magazine for backing feminist goals like access to abortion. She said that women posed nude to further their careers: ''No one ever coerced anybody to take their clothes off,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1971.         Ms. Urry's first husband, Steven Urry, a sculptor, died in 1993. She is survived by her husband, Alan R. Trustman, a screenwriter, and a son, Caleb Urry.         One of Ms. Urry's big successes came from a visit to B. Kliban in his San Francisco studio in the 1970's. She bought six cartoons involving cats for $25, and urged Mr. Kliban to do a book. He became famous for his cat cartoons.         She once said her goal was to prod readers to think about something familiar in a different way. One cartoon she selected, by Chon Day, showed a gentleman in a club remarking, ''While other fellows were swapping wives, I traded mine for 100 shares of I.B.M.''       
         Princess Irene Galitzine, a descendant of Russian nobility who founded a glamorous fashion house in Italy and popularized ornate pants as evening wear in the 1960's, died Friday at her home in Rome. She was believed to be 90.         Her death was announced by Angela Savarese, her assistant, who said she died in her sleep. She left no immediate survivors.         Princess Galitzine's couture collections, shown in a Roman villa, were once praised as the social highlight of the fashion season, and her salon on the Via Veneto was where du Ponts competed with Fords to have first crack at her designs, which often featured a spiral cut. Greta Garbo, whom the princess befriended aboard the yacht of Aristotle Onassis, once appeared at a Galitzine presentation, ''although she disliked the crowd,'' the princess said.         Her most famous design was the evening pants she introduced in Florence about a decade after starting her company, with styles either slim and embroidered or flowing in gauzy fabrics. Diana Vreeland, in Vogue, called them ''palazzo pajamas,'' after the setting of the shows in the Palazzo Pitti. (The princess showed her ready-to-wear line in Florence and her couture designs in Rome, when women who bought those clothes routinely went there to find less expensive designs than those shown in Paris.)         Some American designers, notably Arnold Scaasi, Jane Derby and Norman Norell, had already experimented with the idea of fancy dinner pants for women, but it was Princess Galitzine's appearances in the designs at great society parties that inspired other women to buy them. She said in 1960 that she was deluged with orders even before she showed the look at a fashion show.         ''I was one of Emilio Pucci's best customers, but I got tired of seeing the same clothes I was wearing on other people, so I began making my own things,'' she once said. ''I put them in my first collection, and everybody went wild.''         The most famous palazzo pajamas of all were the ones worn by Claudia Cardinale in the original version of ''The Pink Panther'' (1963). They have frequently been exhibited in Italian fashion retrospectives, including one at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York in 1985 and one in Rome this year.         Princess Irene Galitzine was born in 1916 in Tiflis, Russia (now called Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia). Her father, Prince Boris Galitzine, was an official of the imperial guard, and her mother was Princess Nina Lazareff. When she was 10 months old, her family went into exile during the Bolshevik Revolution, moving to Rome, where they bought a house overlooking the Spanish Steps.         The young princess received a lavish education, learning English at Cambridge and French at the Sorbonne. She worked briefly translating English-language film dialogues, but after studying art and design in Rome, she became an assistant, in 1943, to the Fontana sisters, who operated the most successful Italian couture house of the time.         The princess then started a business importing and reproducing French designs, favoring the collections of Balenciaga and Dior. She married Silvio MÃ©dici de Menezes, a Portuguese aristocrat, in 1949.         The princess began casually designing evening wear for herself and her prominent friends, including Jacqueline Kennedy and the actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn, and eventually decided to work as a designer. Her first show was in 1959, which was an immediate success. She was not as skilled at running a business, however. The company declared bankruptcy in 1968 and then was resurrected several times by manufacturing companies that produced her designs less expensively and in larger quantities.         In the 1990's, the princess returned to Russia several times and opened a store in Moscow in 1996. Fashion and home designs are still manufactured under her name under several licenses in Europe.         Her experience was chronicled in a biography, ''From Russia to Russia,'' published in 1996.       
         Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the Reagan administration's first United Nations ambassador and a beacon of neoconservative thought who helped guide American military, diplomatic and covert action from 1981 to 1985, died Thursday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 80.         Her death was announced yesterday by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, where she was a senior fellow. The cause was congestive heart failure, said her personal assistant, Tammy Jagyur.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was the first American woman to serve as United Nations ambassador. She was the only woman, and the only Democrat, in President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council. No woman had ever been so close to the center of presidential power without actually residing in the White House.         ''When she put her feet under the desk of the Oval Office, the president listened,'' said William P. Clark Jr., Mr. Reagan's national security adviser during 1982 and 1983. ''And he usually agreed with her.''         President Reagan brought her into his innermost foreign policy circle, the National Security Planning Group. There she weighed the risks and rewards of clandestine warfare in Central America, covert operations against Libya, the disastrous deployment of American marines in Lebanon, the invasion of Grenada and support for rebel forces in Afghanistan.         Her public diplomacy made her a national political figure. She was a star performer at the 1984 Republican national convention, deriding the Democrats as the ''blame America first'' party.         She changed her political affiliation after leaving the Reagan administration and thought hard about seeking the Republican nomination for president.         ''So many people talked to me about it so much that they finally persuaded me to consider it,'' she said in October 1987. But she decided against it, fearing she would split the conservative vote and help elect Vice President George H. W. Bush. Though he won, she thought him too moderate to inherit the Reagan legacy.         Fifteen years later, in March 2003, President Bush recalled Ambassador Kirkpatrick to active duty and sent her to Geneva, said Alan Gerson, who had served as her general counsel at the United Nations. The secret mission, previously undisclosed, was to head off a diplomatic uprising against the imminent war against Iraq. Arab ministers wanted to condemn it as an act of aggression.         ''The marching orders we received were to argue that pre-emptive war is legitimate,'' Mr. Gerson said. ''She said: 'No one will buy it. If that's the position, count me out.' ''         Instead, she argued that the attack was justified by Saddam Hussein's violations of United Nations resolutions dating from the 1991 war against Iraq. The foreign ministers found her position convincing and their resolve against the war faded, Mr. Gerson said.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was a political science professor with no diplomatic experience when she arrived at the United Nations in February 1981. Her mission was to wage rhetorical warfare against Moscow and its allies. She sought to restore the international standing of the United States after its defeat in Vietnam and the captivity of Americans in Iran.         Her high-profile performance at the United Nations made her President Reagan's favorite envoy. ''You're taking off that big sign that we used to wear that said, 'Kick Me,' '' the president told her. He admired her strong diplomatic stands and her undiplomatic language. In a letter to 40 third world ambassadors in October 1981, for example, she accused them of spreading ''base lies'' and making ''malicious attacks upon the good name of the United States.''         When nations opposed American foreign policy, she sent their voting records to Congress. The threat was tacit but clear: to stand against the United States meant to risk losing its foreign aid. Her deputy at the United Nations, Kenneth L. Adelman, said she enjoyed such close combat.         ''We were like Davy Crockett at the Alamo,'' he said.         Said She Hated U.N. Job         She professed to detest the United Nations. She compared it to ''death and taxes.'' But she endured it for four years.         At the United Nations, she defended Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the American invasion of Grenada in 1983. She argued for El Salvador's right-wing junta and against Nicaragua's left-wing ruling council, the Sandinistas.         In private, she supported American efforts to sustain the contras, the rebel group that tried to overthrow the Sandinistas with help from the Central Intelligence Agency She was a crucial participant in a March 1981 National Security Planning Group meeting that produced a $19 million covert action plan to make the contras a fighting force.         She was part of a national security team that was often at war with itself. Her relationship with Mr. Reagan's first secretary of state, the four-star general Alexander M. Haig Jr., ''started off bad and got worse over time,'' Mr. Adelman said in an oral history of the Reagan years. She had something Mr. Haig found that he lacked: the president's ear.         Ms. Kirkpatrick first entered Mr. Reagan's inner circle on the strength of a 10,000-word article she published in the neoconservative magazine Commentary in November 1979. The article, ''Dictatorships and Double Standards,'' drew a bright line between right-wing pro-American governments and left-wing anti-American ones.         ''Traditional authoritarian governments,'' she argued, ''are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.'' She said it was an historic mistake for the United States to have shied away from dictators like the Somozas in Nicaragua and the Shah of Iran. If they served American interests, she asserted, they were defensible.         Mr. Reagan read the article closely. Richard V. Allen, who later became the first of his six national security advisers, introduced him to Ms. Kirkpatrick. They met at a February 1980 dinner party given by George F. Will, the syndicated columnist.         She recalled that she wondered aloud how she, a Democrat all her life, could join his team. Mr. Reagan confided, ''I was a Democrat once, you know.'' He won her over. After his election a year later, Ms. Kirkpatrick became the United Nations ambassador and ''Dictatorships and Double Standards'' became an important part of the foreign policy of the United States.         At the United Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick was the target of barbs and backstabbing. Sometimes she was aware of the source, sometimes not.         She knew she was ''a kind of special target for the Soviets -- disinformation target,'' she said at a 2003 foreign policy roundtable convened by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. In 1982, the K.G.B. forged a letter to discredit her and fobbed it off on the Washington correspondent for The New Statesman, a leftist British weekly, which reprinted it. The phony letter was a note of ''best regards and gratitude'' from the intelligence chief of the apartheid South African government.         ''But I felt there was as much disinformation aimed at me from inside our own government, frankly, as from the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick said. ''That's a shocking thing to say, but it is no exaggeration.''         Role as Adviser Blocked         In 1983, Ms. Kirkpatrick was a strong candidate to become President Reagan's third national security adviser. She had support from the director of central intelligence, William J. Casey, and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. But her new boss, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, opposed her.         ''I respected her intelligence, but she was not well suited to the job,'' Mr. Shultz wrote. ''Her strength was in her capacity for passionate advocacy,'' and the post, he added, demanded a ''dispassionate broker.''         Ms. Kirkpatrick was at the June 1984 National Security Planning Group meeting that began the secret initiative that later became known as the Iran-contra affair. Congress had cut off funds for the contras. Mr. Casey wanted to obtain money from foreign countries in defiance of the ban.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was in favor. ''We should make the maximum effort to find the money,'' she said. Mr. Shultz was opposed. ''It is an impeachable offense,'' he said. President Reagan warned that if the story leaked, ''we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House.''         Secret Arms Sales Exposed         Over the next two years, millions skimmed from secret arms sales to Iran went to the contras. The story did leak, as Mr. Reagan feared, and his Administration was shaken by Congressional investigations and criminal charges. Robert C. McFarlane, who had won the national security slot over Ms. Kirkpatrick, pleaded guilty to misinforming Congress.         Mr. McFarlane said he should have stood up against the secret initiative to support the contras. But ''if I'd done that,'' he said, ''Bill Casey, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Cap Weinberger would have said I was some kind of commie.''         By then Ms. Kirkpatrick had left the government. She stuck to a vow to leave the United Nations at the end of Mr. Reagan's first term and resigned in April 1985. She was succeeded by Vernon A. Walters, a former deputy director of central intelligence. The next year, as the Iran-contra story began unfolding, Mr. Casey urged the president to make her secretary of state, but Mr. Reagan rejected the idea.         Ms. Kirkpatrick spent the rest of her career commenting on policy instead of making it. She remained among the most highly regarded members of the Republican establishment, and her voice remained one of the strongest echoes of the Reagan era.         Jeane Duane Jordan was born on Nov. 19, 1926, in Duncan, Okla., about 160 miles northwest of Dallas, the daughter of Welcher F. and Leona Jordan. Her father was an oil wildcatter who moved from town to town searching for a gusher that he never hit.         She attended Stephens College in Missouri for two years, then moved to New York, where she earned a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree from Columbia University in 1950. She went to Washington as a research analyst at the Intelligence and Research Bureau of the State Department, where she met her future husband, Evron Kirkpatrick. Fifteen years her senior, he was a veteran of the wartime Office of Strategic Services, and he soon became the head of the American Political Science Association. They married in 1955 and had three sons -- Douglas Jordan, John Evron and Stuart Alan. Douglas died earlier this year. The other sons and five grandchildren survive her. Mr. Kirkpatrick died in 1995.         In 1967, before completing her doctoral dissertation, she was appointed associate professor at Georgetown University. The next year, she earned a doctorate in political science at Columbia University. Georgetown made her a full professor in 1973 and gave her the endowed Leavey Chair five years later.         Ms. Kirkpatrick supported Jimmy Carter in 1976 and came close to being chosen for an ambassadorship in his administration. But she had become deeply disenchanted with her party.         Swept In With 50 Others         She joined the vanguard of the neoconservative movement, the Committee on the Present Danger, which warned throughout the late 1970s of a disastrous downturn in every aspect of American strength, from nuclear warheads to national image. When Mr. Reagan came to office in 1981, 51 of the committee's members won positions of significant power in his administration.         Power, Ms. Kirkpatrick said in a 1996 interview, is based not merely on guns or money but on the strength of personal conviction.         ''We were concerned about the weakening of Western will,'' she said. ''We advocated rebuilding Western strength, and we did that with Ronald Reagan, if I may say so.''
