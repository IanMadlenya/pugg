        Elaine de Kooning, a painter, teacher and writer on art, died of lung cancer yesterday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in East Hampton.         Elaine de Kooning, a painter, teacher and writer on art, died of lung cancer yesterday at Southampton (L.I.) Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in East Hampton.         Mrs. de Kooning, who was married to the artist Willem de Kooning, was a highly versatile painter whose work ranged from realism to abstraction but was grounded in the gestural Abstract Expressionism of the New York School. Her landscapes, portraits and studies of athletes in action were notable for their verve and freshness.         ''I always say I'm an escape artist,'' she told the critic Rose Slivka when asked to characterize her style. ''Style is something I've always tried to avoid. I'm more interested in character. Character comes out of the work. Style is applied or imposed on it.'' Sketches for a Series         Seized by a particular theme, she would explore many aspects of it. She did 50 watercolor sketches, for instance, to begin a series devoted to Bacchus, a series inspired by her encounter with ''the churning, writhing movement'' of a statue in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris in 1976.         When she was commissioned in 1962 to do a portrait of President John F. Kennedy for the Truman Library in Independence, Mo., she characteristically immersed herself in the project, turning out hundreds of sketches and some two dozen finished canvases in her attempt to capture the President's restless energy.         One of the finished portraits hangs in the Truman Library; the other is in the John F. Kennedy Library at Cambridge, Mass. Cave Art Inspired Recent Work         Her recent work was inspired by the paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, which she felt were close in spirit to 20th-century art. In her show at the Fischbach Gallery in New York City last November, the grafitti-like images of horses, deer, antelope, bison and bulls appeared in flowing panorama, seeming to emerge - as they do in the caves themselves - by means of spontaneous brushwork from the rough, accidental surfaces of the cave walls. The ambitious series was the culmination of work begun in 1983 after a visit to Lascaux.         Elaine Marie Catherine Fried was born in New York City on March 12, 1920, the oldest child of Charles Frank and Mary Ellen O'Brien Fried. She was introduced to art at an early age by her mother, who covered the walls of their Brooklyn home with reproductions of famous paintings. After her graduation from Erasmus Hall High School, she put in a brief stint at Hunter College, then switched to the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in Manhattan, where she fell in with a congenial group of abstract and Social Realist painters. In 1938, at the age of 18, she met Mr. de Kooning in a Manhattan cafeteria. They were married in 1943. First Solo Show in 1952         Mrs. de Kooning's first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery in New York. An insightful writer and lecturer on art, she held teaching posts at many colleges and universities, including Yale, Carnegie-Mellon, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Georgia, Bard College, the Cooper Union and the Parsons School of Fine Art in New York.         Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York and in a number of other institutions throughout the country.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Marjorie Luyckx, and two brothers, Conrad and Peter Fried, all of Freeport, L.I., and a stepdaughter, Lisa, of Springs, L.I.         A funeral service will be held at 1 P.M. on Saturday at the Williams Funeral Home, 99 Newtown Lane, in East Hampton.       
        Marie Syrkin, an author, editor and teacher who was active in the Zionist cause for many decades, died of cancer Wednesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89 years old and lived in Santa Monica.         Marie Syrkin, an author, editor and teacher who was active in the Zionist cause for many decades, died of cancer Wednesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89 years old and lived in Santa Monica.         Miss Syrkin was born in Bern, Switzerland, the daughter of Dr. Nachman Syrkin, a prominent Socialist Zionist theoretician. She came with her family to the United States in 1908 and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Cornell University, then taught high school in New York City. Her first book, ''Your School, Your Children,'' published in 1944, was an impassioned plea for schools to propagandize democratic values instead of remaining neutral in the war of ideas.         In 1950 Miss Syrkin was named associate professor of English at Brandeis University, where she taught until her retirement in 1966 as professor of the humanities.         Her involvement with Zionism dated to the early 1930's, when she was a translator of Yiddish poetry and a commentator on Jewish life in the United States. She was a founder of the Labor Zionist journal Jewish Frontier in 1934 and for a quarter century beginning in 1948 was its editor in chief. Her most recent article for the magazine appears in its current issue. Golda Meir Biography         In the 1940's Miss Syrkin made the first of many trips to Palestine - later Israel - to interview survivors of the Holocaust and to gather material for her 1947 book, ''Blessed Is the Match: The Story of Jewish Resistance,'' which chronicled the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto and other revolts against the Nazis.         A longtime friend and associate of Golda Meir, who was also a schoolteacher, Miss Syrkin published ''Golda Meir: Woman With a Cause'' - a three-volume biography of the Israeli Prime Minister - in 1964. She was a prolific writer for such periodicals as Midstream, Commentary, The Saturday Review, The New York Times Magazine and The New Republic. Her final volume was a collection of essays from those and other magazines entitled ''The State of the Jews,'' published in 1980.         From 1965 to 1969 Miss Syrkin was on the executive body of the World Zionist Movement and during that period was honorary president of the Labor Zionist Movement in the United States.         Miss Syrkin was married to the poet Charles Reznikoff, who died in 1976.         She is survived by a son, David Bodansky of Seattle; a sister, Zivia Wurtele of Santa Monica; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Angna Enters, a dancer and mime, painter and writer, died on Saturday at the County Manor Nursing Home in Tenafly, N.J. She was 82 years old.         Miss Enters became internationally known during the 1920's for an individual style of dance-mime that Stark Young described as ''free of influences foreign to her nature.'' She specialized in character vignettes, frequently described as wordless monologues, developing nearly 300 separate characters for her touring Theater of Angna Enters from 1928 to 1960.         Her range of subjects was wide, from sharply specific satires on politics and the arts to portraits of ordinary young women. ''To my way of thinking, the greatest quality about Angna Enters is her unfetteredness,'' the dance critic Walter Terry wrote in 1946. In her 1926 ''Moyen Age,'' one of her best-known pieces, Miss Enters seemed to have stepped out of a medieval painting as she enacted a woman's reactions to stories of events in the life of Christ, in a series of fluid poses to music by Frescobaldi. Also an Artist and Sculptor         Miss Enters was also a well-known artist and sculptor who held her first New York exhibition in 1933. She designed and executed all the costumes and props for her performances, and illustrated several of the books she wrote on her life and her work. She also composed scores for some of her pieces.         Miss Enters was born in New York City of an Austrian father and French mother, and spent her childhood in Milwaukee and traveling through Europe. She returned to New York in 1922 to enroll at the Art Students' League, where she studied with John Sloan while doing lettering in an advertising agency during the daytime.         Miss Enters had studied ballet in Milwaukee as she had studied piano, she once said, ''to become 'accomplished.' '' Her adult interest in dance began with a concern for the visual representation of movement. First Dance Work in 1923         She enrolled in dance classes taught by Michio Ito in 1922, and performed as his partner in a series of recitals in 1923. That year she created her first piece, ''Ecclesiastique,'' an evocation of a statue of a Gothic Virgin, which she performed in a Broadway revue organized by Ito. The piece later became ''Moyen Age.'' She presented her first solo program in 1924 at the Greenwich Village Theater with a borrowed $25 as her operating budget.         Her reputation grew rapidly over the next two years, and Miss Enters made her London debut in 1928, performing for the first time in Paris the following year.         Miss Enters wrote three volumes of autobiography - ''First Person Plural,'' ''Silly Girl'' and ''Artist's Life'' - a novel, ''Among the Daughters'' (1956), and a book about her work, ''On Mime,'' published in 1966. Her plays, ''Love Possessed Juana: A Play of the Inquisition in Spain'' and ''The Unknown Lover,'' were presented by the Houston Little Theater in 1946 and 1947. A University Lecturer         A noted master teacher, Miss Enters lectured at universities throughout the country. In the early 1960's, she was an artist in residence at the Dallas Theater Center and Baylor University and a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.         Miss Enters retired from performing in 1960, and had been in nursing homes since 1976. There are no survivors.       
        Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         Christine Jorgensen, a former Army private from the Bronx who underwent surgery and hormone treatments in Denmark in 1952 to change from a male to a female, died of cancer yesterday in San Clemente, Calif. She was 62 years old.         The San Clemente General Hospital issued a statement saying Miss Jorgensen's death followed a long bout with bladder and lung cancer.         Miss Jorgensen was born in the Westchester section of the Bronx on May 20, 1926, and was named George Jorgensen Jr. In her book, ''Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Biography,'' published in 1967, Miss Jorgensen said she had a normal, happy childhood but on growing up became frustrated by feelings that she was a woman trapped in a man's body. A Sensation in Tabloids         As George Jorgensen, she served as a clerk in the Army. After being honorably discharged, she decided to seek a sex change operation.         Her sexual conversion began with hormone injections in 1950, when she was 24 years old. It was completed in 1952 with surgery at the Danish State Hospital in Copenhagen under the care of Dr. Christian Hamburger, a Danish hormone expert whose first name she took to form her own.         On her return to the United States in 1955, her transsexualism was sensationalized in the daily tabloids, some of which she gave exclusive interviews.         One tabloid headline read, ''Bronx GI Becomes a Woman!'' and went on, ''Dear Mum and Dad, Son Wrote, I Have Now Become Your Daughter.''         The New York Times carried a five-paragraph Associated Press story headlined, ''Bronx 'Boy' Is Now A Girl.''         ''At first I was very self-conscious and very awkward,'' Miss Jorgensen said in an interview in 1970. ''But once the notoriety hit, it did not take me long to adjust.''         Miss Jorgensen was the first transsexual in the United States to publicly announce her change of sexual identity. Rather than withdraw from public attention, she turned the notoriety to her advantage with a series of lucrative tours on the lecture and nightclub circuit. Her nightclub act featured the theme song, ''I Enjoy Being a Girl.''         ''I decided if they wanted to see me, they would have to pay for it,'' she said. Chose Not to Marry         She made headlines again in 1959 when she sought, but was denied, a license to marry because her birth certificate said she was a male. She later chose not to marry. She could not have had children.         In an interview last year, she said she never regretted her decision to change sexes. She linked the public reaction to her decision, in part, to the awakening that led to the sexual revolution of the 1950's and 1960's.         But as a person who had experienced both sides of the issue, she said in an interview in 1972 that she did not understand the women's liberation movement.         Discussing the subject with a group of students at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, Miss Jorgensen said: ''I don't know very many women who arent't liberated. Men need liberation too.''         For the last 20 years, she lived in California, the last two in San Clemente.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy, and two nieces.       
        Helen Hadassah Lyons, a pioneer in Jewish education for women, died of a brain tumor on Sunday in New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. She was 79 years old and lived in New Rochelle.         Helen Hadassah Lyons, a pioneer in Jewish education for women, died of a brain tumor on Sunday in New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. She was 79 years old and lived in New Rochelle.         In 1939, Mrs. Lyons became the first woman in the United States to complete the full curriculum at a recognized rabbinical college, the Reform movement's Jewish Institute of Religion. But the title rabbi was not conferred on her because women were not ordained at the time.         Though she lacked the title, Mrs. Lyons lectured and preached widely and became an advocate for women's ordination. Women were first ordained as rabbis in the 1970's.         Last year, the seminary from which she graduated, since renamed the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, honored Mrs. Lyons for her scholarship. ''You are blessed,'' the citation said, ''that in your lifetime, you are able to see others travel the path that you had cleared.''         She is survived by her husband, Lester; a daughter, Judith Aviva Lyons of New Rochelle; a son, George David Lyons of West Harrison, Ind., and one granddaughter.       
        Mabel Hampton, an advocate in the gay rights movement, died of pneumonia Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mabel Hampton, an advocate in the gay rights movement, died of pneumonia Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Hampton, a native of Winston Salem, N.C., had been a dancer in earlier years. In 1974, with three other women, she founded the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Manhattan, a collection of lesbian books and artifacts including her personal library.         She was an annual participant in the city's Gay and Lesbian Pride March and was its grand marshal in 1985.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Dolores Ibarruri was better known at home and abroad under her battle name, La Pasionaria, the Passion Flower. A Basque left-winger who was a founder of the Spanish Communist Party, she won international renown during the Spanish Civil War for her indomitable stand.         Dolores Ibarruri was better known at home and abroad under her battle name, La Pasionaria, the Passion Flower. A Basque left-winger who was a founder of the Spanish Communist Party, she won international renown during the Spanish Civil War for her indomitable stand.         In her first broadcast after the outbreak of war in 1936 she told Spanish republicans: ''It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees! They shall not pass!'' The last two words - ''no pasaran'' in Spanish -became the rallying cry of the dying republic.         Later, in her years living in Moscow, she met many Soviet and non-Soviet Communist leaders, including Mao and Ho Chi Minh. Asked in a 1983 interview which of them was most impressive, she answered without hesitation, ''Logically, Stalin.'' In many broadcasts and messages from the Soviet Union to Spain, she advocated collaboration between Communists and all other left-wing and so-called progressive forces, including Roman Catholic groups.         While the Franco regime never forgave her for her role before and during the civil war, which ended in 1939, Spanish anti-Communists would reluctantly acknowledge that she had shown courage and determination. Some backers of Franco would even say privately that La Pasionaria, though in error, was ''a great Spaniard.'' A Delicate Child         Dolores Ibarruri was the 8th of 11 children of a miner's family in the harsh mountains near Bilbao, in northern Spain. Born in the village of Somorrostro on ''a day in December 1895,'' as she wrote in her autobiography, she went to school until she was 15, two years longer than required by law, because she was of delicate health and her parents thought she might become a teacher rather than a manual worker.         The family's poverty prevented this. After being apprenticed to a dressmaker for a short time, she worked for three years as a maid.         At the age of 20 she married Julian Ruiz, a miner from Asturias who had migrated to the Basque country. In her memoirs, ''The Only Way,'' published in Paris, Havana and Mexico in 1962-63, La Pasionaria wrote curiously little about her husband, by whom she had six children, including three girls born as triplets in 1923. All but two of the six died soon after birth. Her only son, Ruben, born in 1922, was reportedly killed in World War II fighting for the Soviet Union.         Deeply religious as a girl, she lost her Roman Catholic faith when she started reading Karl Marx and other radical writers. In 1918 she began working on the miners' newspaper El Minero Vizcaino. Soon she chose her pseudonym for contributions to revolutionary publications. A Founder of Party         She was a member of the first provincial committee of the fledgling Spanish Communist Party in her home province in 1920 and was elected a delegate to the first national Communist congress, which led to the formal founding of the party in 1921. During the next years she emerged as a spellbinding orator, agitator and organizer.         In 1930, elected to the Central Committee of the party, she backed the national leadership in its fight against Trotskyists in Catalonia - a quarrel that was to come into the open again during the civil war.         La Pasionaria moved to Madrid in 1931, having been placed in charge of the party's official organ, Mundo Obrero. Her first visit to the Soviet Union was in 1933-34. She was elected to the Spanish Parliament as a deputy for Asturias in 1934. There, as in other public places, she invariably appeared dressed in black.         In a dramatic session on July 11, 1936, La Pasionaria is said to have exclaimed, ''This is your last speech!'' when Finance Minister Jose Calvo Sotelo, the monarchist leader, attacked the republican Government. On July 13 Mr. Calvo Sotelo was kidnapped and slain by left-wing terrorists, an event that marked the beginning of the civil war. Anti-Communists accused La Pasionaria of having instigated the killing. She denied it.         Throughout the war she made many speeches and broadcasts to urge the country to resist the Nationalist insurgents the way it had resisted Napoleon's troops in 1808. She told women to fight with knives and burning oil. In contrast to her verbal truculence, she is credited by some reports with having saved the lives of nuns who were threatened by mob violence in Madrid early in the war. Communists Grow in Power         As the civil war proceeded, the Communist Party, though comparatively small, became more and more powerful in the republican camp, and La Pasionaria was the most influential Spanish Communist. She consistently backed Palmiro Togliatti, later leader of the Italian Communist Party, whom Moscow had sent as its representative in Spain.         In the spring of 1936, acting on Moscow's orders, she helped bring about the downfall of Francisco Largo Caballero, the Socialist who had been the republic's Prime Minister since September 1936. Juan Negrin, who was Mr. Largo Caballero's successor, is known to have intensly disliked La Pasionaria, but he kept collaborating with the Communists until the republic's collapse in 1938.         La Pasionaria left Spain early in March 1938, shortly before the fall of Madrid. Together with Mr. Negrin and other republican leaders she flew to France and then proceeded to Moscow, where she had sent her two surviving children, Ruben and Amaya, in 1934 for schooling. Organized an Underground         During World War II La Pasionaria made propaganda broadcasts in support of the Soviet war effort. Later she devoted much time to organizing a Communist underground movement for Spain.         After 38 years in Moscow, she returned to Spain in 1977, two years after Franco died. When she made her first appearances in post-Franco Spain, crowds greeted her with chants of ''Si si, si, Dolores esta aqui - ''Yes, yes, yes, Dolores is here.''         The Spanish Communist Party was made legal two years after Franco's death. In 1977 La Pasionaria was re-elected to Parliament, but she later withdrew because of infirmity and age.         She was separated from her husband, Mr. Ruiz, in the 1930's. He died not long after her return to Spain.         Correction:  November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary yesterday about Dolores Ibarruri, the Spanish Communist leader known as La Pasionaria, misstated the year of the fall of the Spanish republic and of her departure for Moscow. It was 1939, not 1938.
