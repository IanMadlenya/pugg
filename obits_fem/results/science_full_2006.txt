         Muriel Costa-Greenspon, a mezzo-soprano who was a fixture at the New York City Opera for 30 years, died on Dec. 26 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68.         Her death was due to natural causes, said her son, Stefano Costa.         A reliable character mezzo, Ms. Costa-Greenspon consistently won critical praise for her musicianship, singing and acting. After making her City Opera debut as Olga Olsen in Kurt Weill's ''Street Scene'' in 1963, she went on to sing everything from Augusta in Douglas Moore's ''Ballad of Baby Doe'' to the three mezzo roles in Puccini's ''Trittico'' to the Old Lady in Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide.''         She had a particular association with the composer Gian Carlo Menotti. She made her professional debut in his ''Old Maid and the Thief'' and later sang the title role in his ''Medium'' at the Festival of Two Worlds (which Mr. Menotti founded), in Spoleto, Italy, among other places. At City Opera, her Menotti roles included parts in ''The Consul'' and ''The Saint of Bleecker Street.''         Muriel Greenspon was born in Detroit in 1937 to deaf parents. She received her B.A. and M.A. from the University of Michigan, and began her opera career singing arias in a restaurant.         Her husband, Giorgio Costa, a carpenter at the Metropolitan Opera and on various Broadway shows, also survives her. In 1984, the two enjoyed a burst of fame when Ms. Costa-Greenspon won $1.7 million in the New York State Lotto game.         Neither quit their day jobs. Ms. Costa-Greenspon continued to appear at City Opera until 1993. She then volunteered in the musical theater program at the Bronx High School of Science, helping to stage student shows.       
         Erica Reiner, an internationally renowned scholar of Assyrian, one of the world's oldest written languages, died on Dec. 31 at her home in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. She was 81.         The cause was lung cancer, according to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, where she was the John A. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor emeritus.         Dr. Reiner spent 44 years working on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, the first of several such monumental undertakings in ancient languages in the United States, and saw it through to completion. Work on the Assyrian project started in 1921. She joined it as a research assistant in 1952, became an associate editor in 1956, editor in 1962, and finally editor in charge from 1973 until her retirement in 1996.         Assyrian, an ornately complex language more commonly called Akkadian, originated in the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers, in Mesopotamia, but in the second millennium B.C. served as a common means of communication throughout the Middle East. From about 2600 B.C. on, it was written in cuneiform, or wedge-shaped letters, impressed by stylus on wax or clay or incised in stone.         Akkadian was the region's predominant tongue for more than 2,500 years, and the dictionary, more than a mere list of words, grew into an encyclopedia of the region's culture, including law, astronomy, poetry, religion and the history of science. Its first volume was published in 1956. It now includes 23 volumes, with two more at the printer and a final volume due later this year.         Dr. Reiner had a hand in all the volumes, said Martha Roth of the institute, now the dictionary's editor in charge, because she continued to write, review and edit entries for them after her formal retirement.         Dr. Reiner's knowledge of Babylonian history of science was legendary among scholars. She wrote ''Astral Magic in Babylonia'' (1995), which traced the roots of Greek medicine and science to Babylonian magical practices using plants and other ingredients and seeking to harness the powers of celestial bodies. Two other books remain in print, ''Adventure of Great Dimension: The Launching of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary'' (2002), and ''Letters from Early Mesopotamia'' (1993), which she edited.         She published ''A Linguistic Analysis of Akkadian'' in 1966 and a collection of essays on the poetry of Babylonia and Assyria in 1985. She was one of only a few people alive proficient in the ancient language called Elamite and published a grammar in 1969.         Erica Reiner was born in Budapest, where she received an undergraduate degree in linguistics in 1948. She studied Elamite, Sumerian and Akkadian in Paris for a diploma from the Ã‰cole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and earned a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1955, the year before she joined the faculty. By that time, three decades had been spent on planning and preparing the Assyrian dictionary, but no draft existed.         Dr. Reiner succeeded in securing sustained support for the project from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1976. A comprehensive record of a past civilization, it was the endowment's longest project, lasting more than 30 years, and the one with the highest level of support. It also became a Mecca for scholars from around the world.         Dr. Reiner is survived by a sister, Eva Cherna of Montreal.       
         Jill Chaifetz, a lawyer who as the executive director of the nonprofit legal group Advocates for Children of New York turned it into a force for reform in the nation's largest school system, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 41.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her brother, Lawrence Chaifetz, said.         In 1998, Ms. Chaifetz joined Advocates for Children, which defends the legal rights of students in public education, and in her time there she quadrupled its staff and budget. One of its goals was the enforcement of standards for the city school system, with 1.1 million students, most of them living in poverty. She sought to empower families who were otherwise without legal resources.         Advocates for Children, which is based in Manhattan, produced many policy papers and reports under Ms. Chaifetz's direction and provided free legal help to students who claimed they were being denied proper educations and services.         In 2003, in one of their most important cases, Ms. Chaifetz and Advocates for Children filed lawsuits against three city high schools, charging that they illegally discharged or turned away students because of their ages, poor grades, poor attendance or pregnancy. Ms. Chaifetz said that the schools had been pushing out many struggling students in reaction to new state standards that judged schools on what percentage of students passed state exams needed to graduate.         After months of skirmishing, the city settled the suits in 2004 and agreed to take back students who had been discharged.         In a memorandum about the settlement, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court said the principles involved, accepted by the city, ''set an important standard for the entire system.'' The cases, he said, ''exposed a lesion -- the alleged 'pushing out' of difficult-to-educate students -- that has been festering for many years.''         Joel I. Klein, the city schools chancellor, whose administration was almost always on the other side of Ms. Chaifetz's recent arguments, said yesterday: ''Jill was an extraordinarily dedicated and effective children's advocate who worked tirelessly to ensure that school reform reached every child. She had a special affinity for the most vulnerable and those who most need a voice, especially children with special needs and English-language learners.''         Ms. Chaifetz worked to help change what she saw as an ingrained culture of discrimination against poor youth.         ''I think kids are one of the last groups of people to be recognized as having fully developed rights,'' she said in an interview in the alumni bulletin of her undergraduate school, Swarthmore College, in September.         Ms. Chaifetz was also an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law.         Ms. Chaifetz was born in New York City on July 24, 1964. She received her undergraduate degree with honors in political science from Swarthmore in 1986 and a law degree from New York University School of Law in 1989.         Before leading Advocates for Children, Ms. Chaifetz established the legal department at the Door, a youth development agency in Manhattan, where she worked from 1992 to 1998. She had previously worked as the legislative attorney for the New York City Council and as program director of a project that helped match law students to needy causes.         Besides her brother, her survivors include her husband, Daniel Seltzer, and their 10-year-old triplets, a daughter, Leila, and two sons, Isaac and Milo, who all have the last name Selchaif; and her parents, Marilyn and Malcolm Chaifetz.       
         Octavia E. Butler, an internationally acclaimed science fiction writer whose evocative, often troubling, novels explore far-reaching issues of race, sex, power and, ultimately, what it means to be human, died on Friday after a fall near her home in Lake Forest Park, Wash. She was 58.         The precise cause of death has not been determined, Ms. Butler's literary agent, Merrilee Heifetz, said on Monday. She added that Ms. Butler had suffered from severe hypertension and other health problems in recent years.         In 1995 Ms. Butler was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, the first science fiction writer to be so honored. She received two Hugo Awards from the World Science Fiction Society and two Nebula Awards from the Science Fiction Writers of America.         Throughout Ms. Butler's career, the news media made much of the fact that she was an African-American woman writing science fiction, traditionally a white male bastion. But in interviews and in her work itself she left no doubt that her background equipped her spectacularly well to portray life in hostile dystopias where the odds of survival can be almost insurmountable.         ''I'm black, I'm solitary, I've always been an outsider,'' The Los Angeles Times quoted Ms. Butler as saying in 1998. She leaves no immediate survivors.         Set in time periods ranging from the historical past to the distant future, Ms. Butler's books were known for their controlled economy of language and for their strong, believable protagonists, many of them black women. She wrote a dozen novels, including ''Parable of the Sower'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1993); ''Parable of the Talents'' (Seven Stories Press, 1998); and, most recently, ''Fledgling'' (Seven Stories), which appeared last year.         Ms. Butler also published a story collection, ''Bloodchild'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1995).         Concerned with empathy and with the need to build community, Ms. Butler's work attracted an audience beyond its genre and was widely praised by critics. Translated into 10 languages, her books have sold more than a million copies altogether, Ms. Heifetz said.         One of Ms. Butler's best-known novels, ''Kindred'' (Doubleday, 1979), told the story of a modern-day black woman who must travel back to the antebellum South to save the life of a white, slaveholding ancestor and, in so doing, save her own. Frequently assigned in black-studies courses, the book was rooted in the experience of the author's mother, who worked as a maid.         ''I didn't like seeing her go through back doors,'' Ms. Butler once told Publishers Weekly. ''If my mother hadn't put up with all those humiliations, I wouldn't have eaten very well or lived very comfortably. So I wanted to write a novel that would make others feel the history: the pain and fear that black people have had to live through in order to endure.''         Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, Calif. As a girl, she was known as Junie. (This may have derived from ''Junior'': her mother was also named Octavia.) Her father, a shoeshine man, died when she was very young, and her mother reared her alone.         Always conspicuously tall for her age, Junie grew up paralytically shy, losing herself in books despite having dyslexia. Octavia Senior could not afford books, but she brought home the tattered discards of the white families for whom she worked.         Octavia Junior began writing stories as a child and soon turned to science fiction, attracted by a genre whose limitless possibilities let her imagine absolutely anything.         ''When I began writing science fiction, when I began reading, heck, I wasn't in any of this stuff I read,'' Ms. Butler told The New York Times in 2000. ''The only black people you found were occasional characters or characters who were so feeble-witted that they couldn't manage anything, anyway. I wrote myself in, since I'm me and I'm here and I'm writing.''         Ms. Butler earned an associate's degree from Pasadena City College in 1968, and later studied at California State University, Los Angeles.         As a student, Ms. Butler became a protÃ©gÃ©e of the renowned science fiction writer Harlan Ellison. Over the next half-dozen years, living alone in a modest Los Angeles apartment, she rose each day at 2 a.m. to write. She supported herself through a series of dystopian jobs: dishwasher, telemarketer, potato chips inspector.         Her first novel, ''Patternmaster,'' was published by Doubleday in 1976. The book centers on a rigidly stratified society ruled by telepathic people called Patternists. It became the first installment in Ms. Butler's highly regarded Patternist series, whose later titles, most from Doubleday, include ''Mind of My Mind'' (1977); ''Survivor'' (1978); ''Wild Seed'' (1980); and ''Clay's Ark'' (St. Martin's, 1984).         Among Ms. Butler's other books are the Xenogenesis trilogy, published by Warner Books and comprising ''Dawn'' (1987), ''Adulthood Rites'' (1988) and ''Imago'' (1989). Her other awards include a lifetime achievement award from PEN Center West and the Langston Hughes Medal from the City College of New York.         In an interview with The New York Times in 2000, Ms. Butler explained the deep appropriateness of her chosen genre as a vehicle for social commentary.         ''We are a naturally hierarchical species,'' she said. ''When I say these things in my novels, sure I make up the aliens and all of that, but I don't make up the essential human character.''       
         Edythe Gaines, a prominent educator who in the 1960's and 70's was one of the highest ranking black officials in the New York City public school system, died on March 23 in Hartford. She was 83.         Ms. Gaines died of natural causes, said her son Richard.         From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Gaines was the executive director of the New York City Board of Education's Office of Educational Planning and Support. The position was one of three senior administrative posts newly created by the board and all carried the title executive director, ranking just below the deputy schools chancellor.         Ms. Gaines left the department in 1975 to become the superintendent of schools in Hartford. She was the first woman, and the first African-American, to hold that post.         Ms. Gaines began her career in 1945 as a teacher in New York City public schools. In 1964, she became the first African-American to serve as principal of a secondary school in the city when she was appointed to lead what was then Junior High School 118, on West 93rd Street in Manhattan. She had taught at the school, which was also called the Joan of Arc School, since the late 1940's.         In 1967, Ms. Gaines was appointed assistant superintendent in charge of School District 12 in the Bronx, where she was responsible for the day-to-day operation of 22 schools serving more than 40,000 students.         Edythe Pauline Jones was born on Sept. 6, 1922, in Asheville, N.C., one of seven children of Jacob Jones, an Episcopal minister, and the former Jennie Dillard, who taught high school English and Latin. Her father died when she was an adolescent, and afterward the family moved to New York.         Ms. Gaines earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from New York University in 1947 and a doctorate in education from Harvard in 1969.         From 1971 to 1973, she directed the Learning Cooperative, an agency of the New York City school system designed to develop educational programs. Ms. Gaines, who left the superintendent's post in Hartford in 1978, was named a commissioner of the Connecticut Public Utilities Control Authority the next year.         Ms. Gaines's husband, Albert Denis Gaines, whom she married in 1941, died in 1995. Besides her son Richard, of Greentown, Pa., she is survived by another son, Mallory, of Newark; five grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89.         She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.         In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities.         At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.         Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.         ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.         Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.         In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.         ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''         Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''         Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''         The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.         Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.         Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.         ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.         ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said.         Action, Not Just Words         Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.         In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape.         The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won.         Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.         She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.         ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.         After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.         But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.         What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.         Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.         A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.         But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.         On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.         In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.         In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.         Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.         In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.         ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''         Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.         ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''         Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.         Subways Lead to Jobs         Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.         She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.         She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.         While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.         Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.         Suspicions Aroused         In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.         ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.         ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''         Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.         ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''         William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.         ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''         The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.         Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''         ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''         Form Over Substance?         Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.         ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.         Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.         She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.         Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.         During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.         She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.         In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.         ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''       
         Henriette D. Avram, a systems analyst who four decades ago transformed millions of dog-eared catalog cards in the Library of Congress into a searchable electronic database, and in the process helped transform the gentle art of librarianship into the sleek new field of information science, died on April 22 in Miami. She was 86 and had lived for many years in California, Md.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Avram, who was not a librarian by training, is widely credited with developing the automated cataloging system that rendered printed cards obsolete. Known to librarians as Marc, for Machine Readable Cataloging, Mrs. Avram's system is, in its current form, the worldwide standard.         Her work changed forever the relationship of a library to its users, making it possible, with the push of a button, to search the holdings of a library thousands of miles away. It also made it possible to ''visit'' the library at midnight attired in nothing more than a bathrobe, a practice brick-and-mortar libraries traditionally discouraged.         When Mrs. Avram joined the Library of Congress in the mid-1960's, the American card catalog had scarcely changed in half a century. Each item in a library's collection was represented by typewritten cards of thick, cream-colored paper. Many of the cards were annotated by hand, in what, impossibly, seemed to be the same handwriting in widely separated libraries. (In fact, the characteristic script -- squarish and slanting slightly backward -- was taught in library schools.)         ''She developed the mechanism for being able to capture the data that the user was seeing on the 3-by-5 catalog card into an electronic format,'' Beacher Wiggins, the director of acquisitions and bibliographic access at the Library of Congress, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''And what that did was open the door for data to be shared broadly.''         Mrs. Avram's work in encoding and organizing data for transmission across long distances also helped set the stage for the development of the Internet, Mr. Wiggins said.         Henriette Regina Davidson was born in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1919. She began premedical studies at Hunter College, and in 1941 married Herbert Mois Avram (pronounced AH-vrum).         In the early 1950's, after her husband took a job with the National Security Agency, Mrs. Avram moved to the Washington area, where she studied mathematics at George Washington University.         Mrs. Avram's husband died in January. She is survived by their children, Marcie, of Manhattan; Lloyd, of Key West, Fla.; and Jay, of Arlington, Va.         In 1952, Mrs. Avram also went to work for the N.S.A., where she learned computer programming; she later worked for Datatrol, an early software company. In 1965, she joined the Library of Congress, where she was put in charge of the Marc pilot project.         It was not a job for the faint-hearted. The catalog comprised millions of items -- books, maps, films, sound recordings and more -- in hundreds of languages, many using non-Roman alphabets. The cards for each item contained many discrete pieces of information (including author, title, publisher and place of publication), each of which would need to be represented with a separate mathematical algorithm.         To translate the cards into something a computer could digest, understand and share, Mrs. Avram also had to enter the mind of the library cataloger, a profession whose arcane knowledge -- involving deep philosophical questions about taxonomy, interconnectedness and the nature of similarity and difference -- was guarded like priestly ritual.         ''A big challenge would be just understanding what goes on in this world of cataloging because it's a really complicated world,'' Allyson Carlyle, an associate professor at the Information School at the University of Washington, said in an interview. ''It's something that's passed from generation to generation; there's still a lot of unwritten practice.''         The pilot project was finished in 1968, and, starting the next year, bibliographic records were dispatched on magnetic tape to libraries around the country. In 1971, Marc became the national standard for electronic cataloging; it was named the international standard two years later. Mrs. Avram retired from the Library of Congress in 1992 as associate librarian for collections services.         Today, a mouse click brings up the Library of Congress Online Catalog (catalog.loc.gov), the modern incarnation of the work Mrs. Avram began in 1965.         It also brings up eBay, where a copy of the American Library Association's book ''Rules for Filing Catalog Cards'' (2nd ed., 1968; 104 pp.; softcover; 6 x 9 inches), can be had for 99 cents.       
         Ruth Gay, a writer known for her nonfiction books documenting Jewish life in the Old World and the New, died on Tuesday in the Bronx. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.         She had been suffering from leukemia, and died at Calvary Hospital, her family said.         Ms. Gay's books include ''Safe Among the Germans: Liberated Jews After World War II'' (Yale University, 2002), which dealt with a little-studied subject: the more than 250,000 Jews who returned to Allied-occupied Germany in the immediate aftermath of World War II.         She also wrote ''The Jews of Germany: A Historical Portrait'' (Yale University, 1992), which chronicled Jewish life in Germany from the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 to the rise of Hitler in 1933.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Peter Filkins called it ''moving and lively.''         ''What emerges is the portrait of a culture very much alive and aware of its own rich heritage,'' he wrote.         In 1997, Ms. Gay received the National Jewish Book Award for nonfiction for ''Unfinished People: Eastern European Jews Encounter America'' (W. W. Norton, 1996). In that book, she examined the immigrant experience through the lens of her own girlhood in the Bronx.         Ruth Slotkin was born in the Bronx on Oct. 19, 1922; her father was a milkman who later opened a delicatessen. She earned a bachelor's degree from Queens College in 1943 and a master's in library science from Columbia in 1969.         Her first marriage, to the sociologist Nathan Glazer, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, the historian Peter Gay; three daughters, Sarah Glazer Khedouri of Larchmont, N.Y.; Sophie Glazer of Fort Wayne, Ind.; and Elizabeth Glazer of Manhattan; two sisters, Shirley Gorenstein of Manhattan and Caroll Boltin of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.         Ms. Gay's book ''The Jewish King Lear Comes to America,'' written with her daughter Sophie, is to be published next year by Yale.       
         Anita B. Roberts, a molecular biologist who made pioneering observations of a protein that is critical in healing wounds and bone fractures and that has a dual role in blocking or stimulating cancers, died on Friday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 64.         The cause was gastric cancer, her family said.         In the early 1980's, Dr. Roberts and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, began to experiment with the protein, called T.G.F.-beta, short for transforming growth factor beta.         Dr. Roberts isolated the protein from bovine kidney tissue and compared her results with T.G.F.-beta taken from human blood platelets and placental tissue. Institute researchers then began a series of experiments to determine the protein's characteristics. They discovered that it helps play a central role in signaling other growth factors in the body to heal wounds and fractures speedily.         A collaborator, Michael B. Sporn, a professor of pharmacology and medicine at Dartmouth, said T.G.F.-beta was later shown to have an effect on regulation of the heartbeat, the response of the eye to aging and also serves as ''a switching point, a node through which all kinds of information flows.''         Dr. Sporn, a former researcher at the National Cancer Institute, added, ''Anita Roberts delivered some of the first studies showing the protein is a key component in healing all types of injuries and was exceptional in collaborating with other scientists.''         In later research, Dr. Roberts and others found that T.G.F.-beta inhibits the growth of some cancers while stimulating growth in advanced cancers, including cancers of the breast and lung.         Anita Bauer Roberts was born in Pittsburgh. She attended Oberlin College and earned her doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin in 1968.         After postdoctoral work at Harvard, Dr. Roberts joined the National Cancer Institute in 1976. From 1995 to 2004, she headed the institute's Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis, and continued her research until this year.         Dr. Roberts was a former president of the Wound Healing Society. In 2005, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.         She is survived by her husband of 41 years, Dr. Robert E. Roberts, a chemist and director of the Science and Technology Policy Institute in Washington; two sons, Dr. Karl Roberts, an orthopedic surgeon in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Greg Roberts, of Alpharetta, Ga.; a sister, Dorrie Derge, of Frederick, Md.; and five grandchildren.       
         Barbara Epstein, a founder and co-editor of The New York Review of Books and a figure at the center of New York literary life for decades, died yesterday in the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in which she had lived for more than 50 years. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her son, Jacob, said. He added that his mother, whose cancer was diagnosed in September 2005, was in her office as recently as two and a half weeks ago.         For much of her career, Ms. Epstein was famous for being part of a tandem. During the 1950's and 60's, she and her husband at the time, Jason, were the first couple of publishing, powerful book editors who knew everyone and gave the kind of high-octane dinner parties that warranted mention in Edmund Wilson's journals.         With Robert Silvers, her co-editor at The New York Review, she had an office partnership that endured even longer than her marriage, which ended in divorce in 1980.         ''Barbara was one of the most influential editors of our time,'' the writer Janet Malcolm said. ''But she had none of the qualities -- aggressiveness, ruthlessness, egotism -- that are commonly associated with powerful editors. Barbara's uncommon modesty, gentleness and charm were the source of a certain mysteriousness. They were also, of course, entirely of a piece with the magazine she and Bob Silvers put out.''         Ms. Epstein was born Barbara Zimmerman, the younger of two sisters, in Boston in 1928. Her father sold textiles and her mother was a homemaker. She attended Girls Latin School and graduated in 1949 from Radcliffe.         She began her editorial career as an assistant at Doubleday, then quickly rose to prominence there as the editor of Anne Frank's ''Diary of a Young Girl,'' among other books. She went on to work at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and The Partisan Review. In 1954 she married Mr. Epstein. Their children, Jacob, of Los Angeles, and Helen, of Brooklyn, survive her, as do three grandchildren.         It was at the Epsteins' dinner table, during the winter of 1962, that the idea for The New York Review of Books was hatched. New York's daily newspapers were on strike, and the absence of The New York Times Book Review had stranded publishers with no place to advertise their books and authors with no place for their work to be written about. To fill the vacuum, Mr. and Mrs. Epstein, together with Robert Lowell and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, who were guests that evening, decided to put out a book review of their own. ''Jason was, like, 'Kids, let's put on a show,' '' Ms. Epstein recalled.         The strike ended in February, but The Review, which had by then come out twice, was so successful that Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers, who had been recruited as co-editor, decided to keep it going. It became one of the most influential and admired journals of its kind, attracting a high-powered roster of writers. The books reviewed and those who reviewed them were all carefully hand picked, causing many to view the magazine as a kind of private club.         Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers made an unusual literary tag team. He is large and formidable. She was small, friendly and enthusiastic. They informally divided the literary turf between them. Mr. Silvers claimed history, politics, science and art history; Ms. Epstein looked after the arts and more literary books. But philosophically they saw eye to eye.         ''We were such close partners in the way of sharing every commission, every manuscript, every decision,'' Mr. Silvers said yesterday. Ms. Epstein, he said, read every manuscript that made it into The Review.         The poet James Fenton said: ''The system was always that whichever was actually editing you, the other was always checking in. Nothing was done by one without the participation of the other.''         Ms. Epstein was famous for putting articles though multiple revisions if necessary, sending out what were known as the A, B, C and sometimes the D and E proofs. ''She was the fiercest editor,'' the writer Diane Johnson, a close friend, recalled. ''Very much the perfectionist, but in a very sympathetic way.''         And she was arguably the more fun-loving of The New York Review's ruling pair, reliably turning up at book parties, no matter how obscure, except on evenings when she was giving her own. Her companion of many years after her divorce was the columnist Murray Kempton, who died in 1997.         ''She loved Champagne,'' the writer Nora Ephron recalled, ''and she herself had this quality that was so fizzy and festive, with such an appetite for trivia and gossip, that you completely forgot she was the editor of The New York Review.''       
         Marie Tharp, an oceanographic cartographer whose work in the 1950's, 60's and 70's helped throw into relief -- literally -- the largely uncharted landscape of the world's ocean floor, died on Wednesday in Nyack, N.Y. She was 86 and a resident of South Nyack.         The cause was cancer, according to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, which announced the death. Ms. Tharp was a researcher at the observatory from 1948 until her retirement in 1982.         With her colleague Bruce C. Heezen (pronounced HAY-zen), Ms. Tharp compiled the first comprehensive map of the entire ocean bottom, illuminating a hidden world of rifts and valleys, volcanic ranges stretching for thousands of miles and mountain peaks taller than Everest. The map was published by the Office of Naval Research in 1977.         In the revised edition of his book ''The Mapmakers'' (Knopf, 2000), John Noble Wilford, a science reporter for The New York Times, described their achievement this way: ''Like other pioneering maps, the one by Heezen and Tharp is not complete and not always completely accurate. It is, nonetheless, one of the most remarkable achievements in modern cartography. It is the graphic summary of more than a century of oceanographic effort.''         Ms. Tharp's work in plotting the ocean's bottom would also help gain acceptance for the theory of continental drift, still a fairly subversive proposition when she and Mr. Heezen began their collaboration in the late 1940's.         Marie Tharp was born in Ypsilanti, Mich., on July 30, 1920, into a mapping family. Her father, William Edgar Tharp, was a soil surveyor for the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Tharps moved wherever his work took him. Ms. Tharp once estimated that by the time she graduated from high school, she had attended two dozen public schools across the country.         She received a bachelor's degree in English and music from Ohio University in 1943, followed the next year by a master's degree in geology from the University of Michigan. While working as a geologist for an oil company in Oklahoma, Ms. Tharp earned a degree in mathematics from the University of Tulsa in 1948.         That year, she joined Columbia's geology department as a research assistant to the eminent scientist Maurice Ewing. Mr. Heezen, who went on to become a leading geologist and oceanographer, was a graduate student there, and he and Ms. Tharp would share their professional and personal lives for the next three decades.         Before the mid-20th century, little was known about the ocean bottom. Many scientists regarded it as a mostly flat, dull expanse whose principal function was to act as a plinth for the masses of water on top of it. There were some mountains down there -- that much was known -- but no one was certain if they were isolated anomalies or part of a larger geologic system.         In 1949, Mr. Ewing and his team moved their base of operations to the newly opened Lamont Geological Observatory (now the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), in Palisades, N.Y. There, they embarked on a quest to map the sea floor using sonar soundings. Because a research vessel was considered no fit place for a woman, Ms. Tharp, working with pen, ruler and what turned out to be a dangerous bottle of India ink, plotted the data back in Palisades.         She noticed something striking. Charting the soundings in 1953, she observed what seemed to be a depression in the mid-Atlantic Ridge, a volcanic chain that traverses the ocean from north to south. She wondered whether the depression was evidence of a continuous rift -- a crack in the world -- down the middle of the ridge. And she wondered in turn whether that rift might be evidence of what scientists now call seafloor spreading, popularly known as continental drift.         She and Mr. Heezen argued about it. She threw erasers and bottles of ink at him. It took him some time to come around.         ''I discounted it as girl talk and didn't believe it for a year,'' Mr. Heezen later said in an interview.         Over time, Ms. Tharp's hunch was proved correct. Her work with Mr. Heezen, along with the work of other scientists, helped establish the existence of a continuous belt of undersea mountains girdling the earth, with a rift down the center of it.         ''It was only in the early 60's that the marine scientists around the world started putting the pieces of the puzzle together and understanding that these huge volcanic mountain chains were actually where seafloor spreading was taking place,'' Michael Purdy, the director of the Lamont-Doherty observatory, said in a telephone interview yesterday.         Like many women of her era in science, Ms. Tharp was recognized mainly late in life. In 1997, she was honored by the Library of Congress as part of the 100th anniversary of its geography and map division. A fellowship at Lamont-Doherty to promote women in science now bears her name.         The boys finally let her onto the boat, and in her later years, Ms. Tharp sailed the seas, plotting them.         Ms. Tharp leaves no immediate survivors. Mr. Heezen died aboard a submarine, apparently of a heart attack, in 1977.         Of all the waters Ms. Tharp plotted, she found the Atlantic the most congenial. ''It's such a nice symmetrical ocean,'' she told The New York Times in 1991. ''I felt sorry for the people who had to do the Pacific -- it was so much more complicated.''       
         Alice Stone Ilchman, an economist and political scientist who was president of Sarah Lawrence College for nearly 20 years, died on Friday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said Judith Schwartzstein, a spokeswoman for the college, which is in Bronxville.         The eighth president of Sarah Lawrence, Ms. Ilchman (pronounced ILTSCH-man) was also its longest serving, holding the post from 1981 until 1998. She was previously an assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in the administration of President Jimmy Carter.         At her death, Ms. Ilchman was the director of the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship of the Thomas J. Watson Foundation. From 1995 to 2000, she was chairwoman of the Rockefeller Foundation.         Alice Stone was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1935. Her father, Donald Crawford Stone, was an educator and federal planner in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. She earned a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke in 1957; a master's from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1958; and a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics in 1965. She married Warren F. Ilchman in 1960.         After earning her doctorate, Ms. Ilchman directed the Peace Corps training program for India and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. She later taught economics at Wellesley, where she was Dean of the College         During Ms. Ilchman's tenure at Sarah Lawrence, the college's endowment grew from $3 million to $30 million. She oversaw the construction of two new buildings, including a science center, which was named for her this May.         Besides her husband, a former president of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn who is now the director of the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, Ms. Ilchman is survived by a son, Frederick, of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Hollinger of New York; two sisters, Nancy Dickinson of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Stone of Los Angeles; and a brother, Donald C. Stone Jr. of Oakland, Calif.       
         Evelyn Ortner, who with her husband, Everett, was among the first, the most vocal and the most effective champions of the brownstone revival that spread from Brooklyn to the rest of the country, died on Tuesday at her home in Park Slope. She was 82.         The cause has not been determined. She had a mastectomy two weeks ago, but had seemed to be doing well until her death, her husband said.         Victorian homes had fallen into disfavor and many middle-class New Yorkers were moving to the suburbs by 1963, when Mrs. Ortner and her husband bought a four-story 1886 brownstone on Berkeley Place in Park Slope.         Mrs. Ortner, an interior designer before she became a preservationist, was so enchanted by that house, with its original mahogany woodwork and papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and linseed-oil wallpaper, that she began a campaign to save thousands of other brownstones from neglect or the wrecking ball.         Many of the graceful 19th-century single-family homes in Park Slope were owned by absentee landlords and had been cut up into rooming houses. In other parts of New York, old homes were being lost to federally sponsored urban renewal projects.         The Ortners decided to make brownstones -- and Brooklyn -- appealing to many people who had never considered anything but apartment life in Manhattan. To attract other preservationists, the Ortners and a small group of likeminded Brooklynites began conducting some historic-house tours to present dilapidated houses as opportunities. Mrs. Ortner publicized the tours by dressing in antique clothing and posing for newspaper photographers.         She and her husband convinced Brooklyn Union Gas that it would be good business to buy another old house, then occupied by pigeons, and turn it into a showcase. That house, at 211 Berkeley Place, became the first of a series of Cinderella Projects undertaken by the company, now called Keyspan, and the Ortners were eventually featured in full-page Brooklyn Union ads.         In 1968, the Ortners helped found the Brownstone Revival Committee, now known as the Brownstone Revival Coalition, a citywide preservation organization.         ''It was the beginning of the brownstone frenzy, the mania,'' she said in an interview in 2003 conducted as part of the New York Preservation Archive Project.         In 1974, the brownstone coalition held a national ''Back to the City'' conference at the Waldorf-Astoria, which was followed by 13 other annual conferences in 13 cities, including St. Paul, Hartford, Washington and San Antonio, Mr. Ortner said.         Mrs. Ortner did much of the historical research that persuaded the New York City Landmarks Preservation Committee to designate the Park Slope historic district in 1973, her husband said.         ''Because of her knowledge of interior design and her personal charm, she was able to convince large numbers of people that saving brownstones and saving neighborhoods were worthwhile causes,'' said Ronda Wist, executive director of the New York City Landmarks Commission.         Mrs. Ortner's enthusiasm was infectious. Clem Labine was a writer for Chemical Engineering magazine when he met her at a New Year's Eve party in 1966. He was planning to move to the suburbs, and the Ortners persuaded him to buy a brownstone a block away from them. He went on to found magazines called Old House Journal, Traditional Building and Period Homes.         Evelyn Gelbman was born in Manhattan on July 4, 1924, the daughter of Joseph Gelbman, an electrical contractor, and his wife, Stella. She grew up in the north Bronx and earned a bachelor's degree in Spanish from Hunter College. In 1953, she married Everett, an editor at Popular Science magazine for 33 years. Besides her husband, she is survived by her brother, Bernard Gelbman of Manhattan.         She studied interior design at Pratt Institute in the 1950's and historic preservation at Columbia University in the 1970's and until recently worked as an interior designer.         She championed the restoration of the stained glass windows at St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn, beginning in 1979. That project led to the creation of the Brooklyn Stained Glass Conservation Center, a nonprofit studio, of which she was the president. From 1979 to 1984, she was director of facilities and collections of the New York Chamber of Commerce.         In part because of their own difficulty in getting a mortgage for their $32,500 house, the Ortners were prominent in the anti-redlining campaigns beginning in the mid-1960's, when many banks were reluctant to finance mortgages in declining neighborhoods like Park Slope, Cobble Hill and even Brooklyn Heights, where brownstones now routinely sell for millions of dollars.         She was never motivated by money. The only house that she and her husband ever owned was their own, where she was living at the time of her death.       
         Maureen Daly, a writer whose first novel, ''Seventeenth Summer,'' anticipated the young-adult genre by decades when it appeared in 1942 and has endured as a classic coming-of-age story, died on Monday in Palm Desert, Calif. She was 85 and made her home in Palm Desert.         The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, her sister, Sheila Daly White, said.         Written when Ms. Daly was a teenager and published while she was still in college, ''Seventeenth Summer'' told the story of Angie and Jack, two teenagers who fall in love during one enchanted summer in a Wisconsin lakeside town. Written in a straightforward, unpretentious style, the book is full of innocent pastimes -- boating on the lake, Cokes at the corner drugstore -- mingled with more grown-up pleasures like beer and cigarettes.         Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Edith H. Walton wrote:         ''By a kind of miracle, and perhaps because she is so close to an experience not easy to recapture, Miss Daly has made an utterly enchanting book out of this very fragile little story -- one which rings true and sweet and fresh and sound.''         Published originally by Dodd, Mead & Company and most recently in 2002 by Simon & Schuster, ''Seventeenth Summer'' has sold more than a million copies worldwide, according to the reference book Authors and Artists for Young Adults.         Though fiction about adolescents was nothing new in the 1940's -- among its eminent practitioners had been Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington and Louisa May Alcott -- the concept of novels specifically earmarked for adolescents would not exist until the late 1960's, ushered in by writers like Paul Zindel and S. E. Hinton.         Yet a quarter-century earlier, ''Seventeenth Summer'' anticipated many of these authors' concerns, as Teri Lesesne, a professor of library science at Sam Houston State University and a specialist in young-adult literature, explained in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''For '42, this is a pretty avant-garde young woman: she smokes, she drinks, she dates,'' Ms. Lesesne said. ''She thinks about more than a chaste kiss at the end of a date.''         Maureen Patricia Daly was born on March 15, 1921, in Castlecaulfield, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. She came to the United States with her family as a young child.         When Ms. Daly was 15, her short story ''Fifteen'' was published in Scholastic magazine. The next year she wrote another story, fittingly titled ''Sixteen,'' that was included in the O. Henry collection of 1938, which gathered together the best short stories of the previous year. Then, working in the basement of her parents' home in Fond du Lac, Wis., she began ''Seventeenth Summer.''         After earning undergraduate degrees in English and Latin from Rosary College in River Forest., Ill., Ms. Daly worked as a reporter and book critic for The Chicago Tribune. She was later on the staff of Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post.         Among her many other books are the young-adult novels ''Acts of Love'' (1986) and ''First a Dream'' (1990), both published by Scholastic, and ''Mention My Name in Mombasa: The Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad'' (Dodd, Mead, 1958), a travel memoir written with her husband, William P. McGivern, a well-known crime novelist.         Ms. Daly's husband died in 1982; her daughter, Megan McGivern Shaw, died the next year. Besides her sister, Ms. White, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Patrick McGivern, of Palm Desert, and two grandchildren.         In an interview quoted in the reference book Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, Ms. Daly recalled the special urgency -- akin to grasping quicksilver -- that gave rise to ''Seventeenth Summer.''         ''I was so wildly and vividly happy about love and life at a particular time in my existence,'' she said. ''I wanted to get all that fleeting excitement down on paper before it passed, or I forgot the true feelings.''         She added, ''It was not until the reviews came out (and the royalties came in) that I realized I had recorded universal emotions and joys -- and people would want to read about them year after year.''       
         Estelle R. Ramey, an endocrinologist, physiologist and feminist who came to national prominence in 1970 after she famously rebutted a Democratic leader who pronounced women unfit for important jobs because of the ''raging hormonal influences'' to which they were supposedly subject, died Friday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 89.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Drucilla Stender Ramey.         Professor Ramey was most recently emeritus professor of physiology and biophysics at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, where she had taught for many years.         The controversy arose in April 1970, at a session of the Democratic Party's Committee on National Priorities. Representative Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii had just urged the committee to make women's rights a major issue. She was challenged by a committee member, Edgar F. Berman, a retired surgeon and a confidant of Hubert H. Humphrey, the former vice president.         ''If you had an investment in a bank,'' Dr. Berman said, ''you wouldn't want the president of your bank making a loan under these raging hormonal influences at that particular period.''         He continued: ''Suppose we had a president in the White House, a menopausal woman president who had to make the decision of the Bay of Pigs?'' (He meant the Cuban missile crisis.)         Reading Dr. Berman's remarks, Professor Ramey was moved to action. She studied hormones for a living. She also had, as she would later say in interviews, ''a very sharp tongue.''         In a letter published in The Washington Star, she wrote, ''As an endocrinologist in good standing, I was startled to learn that ovarian hormones are toxic to brain cells.''         She went on to remind the public that during the Cuban missile crisis, the nation had a president who suffered from a severe hormonal imbalance: John F. Kennedy, who had Addison's disease, an endocrine disorder.         Her comments were widely reproduced, and Professor Ramey was soon in great demand in the news media and on the lecture circuit. Amid the furor over his remarks, Dr. Berman was forced to resign from the committee.         Estelle Rosemary Rubin was born in Detroit on Aug. 23, 1917, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Europe. The family moved to Brooklyn when she was a baby and, after her father died when she was an adolescent, their existence was threadbare.         After graduating from high school at 15, she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and biology from Brooklyn College in 1937; a master's in physical chemistry from Columbia in 1940 and a doctorate in physiology from the University of Chicago in 1950.         Before joining the Georgetown faculty in 1956, Professor Ramey taught at Queens College, the University of Tennessee and the University of Chicago. A founder and former president of the Association for Women in Science, she also was a past member of the President's Advisory Committee for Women.         Besides her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, James T. Ramey, whom she married in 1941; a son, James N., of Bethesda; a brother, Jack Rubin, formerly of Little Neck, N.Y.; and five grandchildren. Information on other survivors could not immediately be confirmed.         Throughout her research, which focused on the relationship between hormones and stress, Professor Ramey was struck again and again by the fact that men seem to be at a natural hormonal disadvantage: they are more inclined toward aggression, die sooner and are more prone to heart attacks and strokes.         As she often said in the popular press, ''Maleness is a biological risk factor.''         Dr. Berman, who helped propel Professor Ramey into the national spotlight, died in 1987, at 68, of a heart attack.       
         Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, who, with a younger brother, wrote ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' the account of their growing up in a family of 12 children that led to several movies of the same name, died on Saturday in Fresno, Calif. She was 98 and lived in Reedley, Calif.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Charles E. Carey.         ''Cheaper by the Dozen,'' which became a best seller when it was published in 1948, beguiled readers with the autobiographical details of the Gilbreths, a family in the 1920's dominated by Dad but discreetly monitored by Mother. The book, replicated in numerous editions since its publication, is a testament to the intelligence, energy and eccentricity of the Gilbreth parents, who ran the family's management consulting firm.         The business focused on the science of motion study and industrial efficiencies. Frank Bunker Gilbreth believed that the factory management principles he espoused to his clients could also be applied to his family of six girls and six boys, produced in 17 years; Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who had a Ph.D. from Brown University (earned around 1915, while she had several children at home), was an industrial psychologist and an engineering expert. Mr. Gilbreth died of a heart attack in 1924 at 55, the day after Mrs. Carey graduated from high school; his wife died in 1972 at 93.         Mrs. Carey's brother Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. received first billing as a co-author, and the book's narrative voice is decidedly unified, never betraying who wrote what. Nevertheless, Mrs. Carey wrote other books (as did her brother, who died in 2001), including ''Jumping Jupiter,'' ''Rings Around Us'' and ''Giddy Moment.''         The charming havoc of ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' found a wide audience just after World War II. Mrs. Carey and her brother mined a rich vein of humorous and quirky material from the Gilbreth clan. Mrs. Carey, the third child, and Frank, the fifth, plumbed what appeared to be the best of living in a brood that size.         An outing in their Pierce-Arrow, with Dad at the wheel and babies tucked in the front seat near Mother in the days before seat belts, felt ''like a back somersault off the high diving board.'' The household was described as ''organized confusion,'' resembling a ''newspaper on election night.'' In their house in Montclair, N.J., servants took care of cooking and gardening, although every child was assigned to look after a younger sibling and performed other tasks.         Given their father's penchant for order, ''nothing was considered more of a sin in our house than wasted time and motions,'' the authors wrote. Dad, though a benevolent soul, ran a household that was above all else driven to learn. Language records were played in the bathrooms while the children washed; they absorbed French and German that was later recited at the dinner table. Mealtime could be as intense as a board meeting, since ''no one could talk unless the subject was of general interest.'' Practical jokes, centered around Dad, defused the tension.         Toward the book's end, Ern, as Mrs. Carey was called, briefly enjoyed some of the spotlight when she and her older sister, Anne (who died in 1987), began dating in high school. With her wide face and compelling gaze, she attracted many suitors. But Dad had a little trouble with this, referring to one fellow as a ''simpleton with pimples in his voice.'' That didn't stop another boy from climbing a cherry tree near Ern's bedroom to spy on her, inciting her to label him a ''sneaking Peeping Tom.''         Hollywood wasted little time, spiriting ''Cheaper by the Dozen'' into a movie by 1950, starring Myrna Loy as Mother and Clifton Webb as Dad. It was remade and modernized in 2003 with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents, with ''Cheaper by the Dozen 2'' appearing in 2005. The Gilbreth brother-and-sister team also wrote ''Belles on Their Toes,'' a 1950 sequel that was turned into a movie in 1952. In July of this year Mrs. Carey finished writing a memoir but did not want to talk about it prematurely for fear of ''bad luck.''         Mrs. Carey graduated from Smith College in 1929, with a degree in English. She worked as a department-store buyer and in management in New York City for 14 years, marrying Charles E. Carey, who died in 1986, and having two children. Her own mother eventually lived with Mrs. Carey, after a long career of mothering, teaching, writing and consulting. Mrs. Carey also gathered her mother's extensive papers and photographs to donate them to Smith College.         Mrs. Carey is survived by two brothers, Frederick Gilbreth of Larchmont, N.Y., and Robert Gilbreth, of Franklin, N.H.; her children Charles E. Carey of Livermore, Calif., and Lillian Barley of Riverdale, Calif.; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the Reagan administration's first United Nations ambassador and a beacon of neoconservative thought who helped guide American military, diplomatic and covert action from 1981 to 1985, died Thursday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 80.         Her death was announced yesterday by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, where she was a senior fellow. The cause was congestive heart failure, said her personal assistant, Tammy Jagyur.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was the first American woman to serve as United Nations ambassador. She was the only woman, and the only Democrat, in President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council. No woman had ever been so close to the center of presidential power without actually residing in the White House.         ''When she put her feet under the desk of the Oval Office, the president listened,'' said William P. Clark Jr., Mr. Reagan's national security adviser during 1982 and 1983. ''And he usually agreed with her.''         President Reagan brought her into his innermost foreign policy circle, the National Security Planning Group. There she weighed the risks and rewards of clandestine warfare in Central America, covert operations against Libya, the disastrous deployment of American marines in Lebanon, the invasion of Grenada and support for rebel forces in Afghanistan.         Her public diplomacy made her a national political figure. She was a star performer at the 1984 Republican national convention, deriding the Democrats as the ''blame America first'' party.         She changed her political affiliation after leaving the Reagan administration and thought hard about seeking the Republican nomination for president.         ''So many people talked to me about it so much that they finally persuaded me to consider it,'' she said in October 1987. But she decided against it, fearing she would split the conservative vote and help elect Vice President George H. W. Bush. Though he won, she thought him too moderate to inherit the Reagan legacy.         Fifteen years later, in March 2003, President Bush recalled Ambassador Kirkpatrick to active duty and sent her to Geneva, said Alan Gerson, who had served as her general counsel at the United Nations. The secret mission, previously undisclosed, was to head off a diplomatic uprising against the imminent war against Iraq. Arab ministers wanted to condemn it as an act of aggression.         ''The marching orders we received were to argue that pre-emptive war is legitimate,'' Mr. Gerson said. ''She said: 'No one will buy it. If that's the position, count me out.' ''         Instead, she argued that the attack was justified by Saddam Hussein's violations of United Nations resolutions dating from the 1991 war against Iraq. The foreign ministers found her position convincing and their resolve against the war faded, Mr. Gerson said.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was a political science professor with no diplomatic experience when she arrived at the United Nations in February 1981. Her mission was to wage rhetorical warfare against Moscow and its allies. She sought to restore the international standing of the United States after its defeat in Vietnam and the captivity of Americans in Iran.         Her high-profile performance at the United Nations made her President Reagan's favorite envoy. ''You're taking off that big sign that we used to wear that said, 'Kick Me,' '' the president told her. He admired her strong diplomatic stands and her undiplomatic language. In a letter to 40 third world ambassadors in October 1981, for example, she accused them of spreading ''base lies'' and making ''malicious attacks upon the good name of the United States.''         When nations opposed American foreign policy, she sent their voting records to Congress. The threat was tacit but clear: to stand against the United States meant to risk losing its foreign aid. Her deputy at the United Nations, Kenneth L. Adelman, said she enjoyed such close combat.         ''We were like Davy Crockett at the Alamo,'' he said.         Said She Hated U.N. Job         She professed to detest the United Nations. She compared it to ''death and taxes.'' But she endured it for four years.         At the United Nations, she defended Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the American invasion of Grenada in 1983. She argued for El Salvador's right-wing junta and against Nicaragua's left-wing ruling council, the Sandinistas.         In private, she supported American efforts to sustain the contras, the rebel group that tried to overthrow the Sandinistas with help from the Central Intelligence Agency She was a crucial participant in a March 1981 National Security Planning Group meeting that produced a $19 million covert action plan to make the contras a fighting force.         She was part of a national security team that was often at war with itself. Her relationship with Mr. Reagan's first secretary of state, the four-star general Alexander M. Haig Jr., ''started off bad and got worse over time,'' Mr. Adelman said in an oral history of the Reagan years. She had something Mr. Haig found that he lacked: the president's ear.         Ms. Kirkpatrick first entered Mr. Reagan's inner circle on the strength of a 10,000-word article she published in the neoconservative magazine Commentary in November 1979. The article, ''Dictatorships and Double Standards,'' drew a bright line between right-wing pro-American governments and left-wing anti-American ones.         ''Traditional authoritarian governments,'' she argued, ''are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.'' She said it was an historic mistake for the United States to have shied away from dictators like the Somozas in Nicaragua and the Shah of Iran. If they served American interests, she asserted, they were defensible.         Mr. Reagan read the article closely. Richard V. Allen, who later became the first of his six national security advisers, introduced him to Ms. Kirkpatrick. They met at a February 1980 dinner party given by George F. Will, the syndicated columnist.         She recalled that she wondered aloud how she, a Democrat all her life, could join his team. Mr. Reagan confided, ''I was a Democrat once, you know.'' He won her over. After his election a year later, Ms. Kirkpatrick became the United Nations ambassador and ''Dictatorships and Double Standards'' became an important part of the foreign policy of the United States.         At the United Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick was the target of barbs and backstabbing. Sometimes she was aware of the source, sometimes not.         She knew she was ''a kind of special target for the Soviets -- disinformation target,'' she said at a 2003 foreign policy roundtable convened by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. In 1982, the K.G.B. forged a letter to discredit her and fobbed it off on the Washington correspondent for The New Statesman, a leftist British weekly, which reprinted it. The phony letter was a note of ''best regards and gratitude'' from the intelligence chief of the apartheid South African government.         ''But I felt there was as much disinformation aimed at me from inside our own government, frankly, as from the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick said. ''That's a shocking thing to say, but it is no exaggeration.''         Role as Adviser Blocked         In 1983, Ms. Kirkpatrick was a strong candidate to become President Reagan's third national security adviser. She had support from the director of central intelligence, William J. Casey, and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. But her new boss, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, opposed her.         ''I respected her intelligence, but she was not well suited to the job,'' Mr. Shultz wrote. ''Her strength was in her capacity for passionate advocacy,'' and the post, he added, demanded a ''dispassionate broker.''         Ms. Kirkpatrick was at the June 1984 National Security Planning Group meeting that began the secret initiative that later became known as the Iran-contra affair. Congress had cut off funds for the contras. Mr. Casey wanted to obtain money from foreign countries in defiance of the ban.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was in favor. ''We should make the maximum effort to find the money,'' she said. Mr. Shultz was opposed. ''It is an impeachable offense,'' he said. President Reagan warned that if the story leaked, ''we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House.''         Secret Arms Sales Exposed         Over the next two years, millions skimmed from secret arms sales to Iran went to the contras. The story did leak, as Mr. Reagan feared, and his Administration was shaken by Congressional investigations and criminal charges. Robert C. McFarlane, who had won the national security slot over Ms. Kirkpatrick, pleaded guilty to misinforming Congress.         Mr. McFarlane said he should have stood up against the secret initiative to support the contras. But ''if I'd done that,'' he said, ''Bill Casey, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Cap Weinberger would have said I was some kind of commie.''         By then Ms. Kirkpatrick had left the government. She stuck to a vow to leave the United Nations at the end of Mr. Reagan's first term and resigned in April 1985. She was succeeded by Vernon A. Walters, a former deputy director of central intelligence. The next year, as the Iran-contra story began unfolding, Mr. Casey urged the president to make her secretary of state, but Mr. Reagan rejected the idea.         Ms. Kirkpatrick spent the rest of her career commenting on policy instead of making it. She remained among the most highly regarded members of the Republican establishment, and her voice remained one of the strongest echoes of the Reagan era.         Jeane Duane Jordan was born on Nov. 19, 1926, in Duncan, Okla., about 160 miles northwest of Dallas, the daughter of Welcher F. and Leona Jordan. Her father was an oil wildcatter who moved from town to town searching for a gusher that he never hit.         She attended Stephens College in Missouri for two years, then moved to New York, where she earned a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree from Columbia University in 1950. She went to Washington as a research analyst at the Intelligence and Research Bureau of the State Department, where she met her future husband, Evron Kirkpatrick. Fifteen years her senior, he was a veteran of the wartime Office of Strategic Services, and he soon became the head of the American Political Science Association. They married in 1955 and had three sons -- Douglas Jordan, John Evron and Stuart Alan. Douglas died earlier this year. The other sons and five grandchildren survive her. Mr. Kirkpatrick died in 1995.         In 1967, before completing her doctoral dissertation, she was appointed associate professor at Georgetown University. The next year, she earned a doctorate in political science at Columbia University. Georgetown made her a full professor in 1973 and gave her the endowed Leavey Chair five years later.         Ms. Kirkpatrick supported Jimmy Carter in 1976 and came close to being chosen for an ambassadorship in his administration. But she had become deeply disenchanted with her party.         Swept In With 50 Others         She joined the vanguard of the neoconservative movement, the Committee on the Present Danger, which warned throughout the late 1970s of a disastrous downturn in every aspect of American strength, from nuclear warheads to national image. When Mr. Reagan came to office in 1981, 51 of the committee's members won positions of significant power in his administration.         Power, Ms. Kirkpatrick said in a 1996 interview, is based not merely on guns or money but on the strength of personal conviction.         ''We were concerned about the weakening of Western will,'' she said. ''We advocated rebuilding Western strength, and we did that with Ronald Reagan, if I may say so.''
