        Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Gerald Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which helped to plead her case, said Mrs. Meiman was admitted to the center on Jan. 20. In asking to go abroad, Mrs. Meiman said she wanted to undergo specialized radiation treatment, her only remaining hope for survival. Complications Reported         According to Mr. Strober, she had various tests complicated by low blood pressure, drug-induced diabetes and infection.         ''Basically she was still being evaluated for the start of chemotherapy,'' Mr. Strober said.  She was the wife of Prof. Naum Meiman, a mathematician who himself had long been denied an exit visa on the ground that he did secret work 30 years ago. Professor Meiman, 76 years of age, was a member of a now-disbanded group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki accords of 1975.         Professor Meiman said last month that he did not think officials might relent and let him follow his wife now that her health had become precarious. He said that his wife had undergone chemotherapy and four operations and that her only chance lay in American experimental treatment.         Mrs. Meiman, a teacher of English, was married to Professor Meiman in 1981.         Word that she might be able to leave first came from Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat and possible Democratic Presidential candidate, while he was on a visit to Moscow in December. He said he had made a special plea for her to Mikhael S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.         Later, in a meeting, with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Senator Hart was informed of that the case was being ''reconsidered.'' Another Soviet cancer patient, Rimma Bravve, left Moscow on Dec. 18 in Senator Hart's company to receive treatment in New York. Left With Mixed Feelings         At the time of her own departure, Mrs. Meiman said she was leaving with ''mixed feelings'' since her husband had to stay behind. She said she had been feeling weak for some weeks and was eager to enter the Georgetown center.         Donna Hartman, the wife of Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman, accompanied Mrs. Meiman through routine customs and passport controls.         Mrs. Meiman is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Leo Kitrossky, a scientist in Moscow with three children. Also surviving is a daughter of Professor Meiman by a previous marriage, Olga Plam of Boulder, Colo.         INNA MEIMAN, EMIGRE, DIES AT 53       
        Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Nora Kaye, a leading American ballerina whose exceptional power as a dramatic dancer made her an international star, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles after a long illness. She was 67.         Miss Kaye was one of the foremost ballerinas of her time. Although she danced many classical roles, she became known for creating a new contemporary look among dancers, especially in Antony Tudor's dance-dramas in the 1940's and 1950's.         In an era when ballet was considered a Russian art, Miss Kaye remained steadfastly an American dancer. Her last name was originally Koreff, but she changed it to Kaye because ''an American dancer ought to have an American name,'' as she put it.         Called the ''Duse of the dance,'' Miss Kaye excelled in dramatic roles. The world premiere by Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, of Mr. Tudor's psychological ballet ''Pillar of Fire'' catapulted her to stardom in 1942. Symbol of Tenacity and Vigor         Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ballet Theater's current artistic director, said of the ballerina: ''She was undoubtedly a great woman of the theater and a symbol to any dancer of tenacity, vigor and what it means to be a great star. Everyone in the dance world mourns her and is sad today.''         Miss Kaye was a charter member of Ballet Theater from the company's first year, 1939. There she worked with Mr. Tudor, one of the company's choreographers and teachers, who revealed ballet to her as an expressive art.         During Ballet Theater's first New York season early in 1940, she danced in the chorus of several Tudor ballets. The choreographer offered Miss Kaye her first important dramatic or character role, that of the Russian ballerina in his comic ballet ''Gala Performance,'' for its premiere in February 1941.         But it was her portrayal of the sexually repressed Hagar in ''Pillar of Fire,'' that raised Miss Kaye to the status of prima ballerina and helped make her one of the best-known American ballerinas in the world.         Reviewing the ballet at its premiere in April 1942, John Martin, then dance critic of The New York Times, rated Miss Kaye's characterization as among ''the great examples of tragic acting of its generation.'' 'I Wanted to Extend Myself'         By 1943, Miss Kaye was dancing most of the lead female roles in the Ballet Theater repertory. She performed with the company through 1951, when she left to dance with the New York City Ballet.         She was not well suited to the City Ballet style, however. though she had notable triumphs, among them her portrayal of the man-killing Novice in ''The Cage,'' which Jerome Robbins created for her. ''I wanted to extend myself,'' she said in 1977 of her years with City Ballet, ''but I was wrong for it.'' She returned to Ballet Theater in 1954 and danced with the company until 1959. She retired from the stage in 1961.         Miss Kaye was known as a Tudor ballerina, but she danced ballets by many other contemporary choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, George Balanchine, Valerie Bettis, Kenneth MacMillan, John Taras and Herbert Ross, whom she married in 1959.         Born in New York City, and named after the heroine of ''A Doll's House,'' Miss Kaye was exposed at an early age to Stanislavskian acting by her father, Gregory Koreff, a former actor with the Moscow Art Theater. She began studying dance at the age of 5, working with the celebrated choreographer Michel Fokine.         At 8, Miss Kaye entered Margaret Curtis's ballet class at the Metropolitan Opera school. At 15, she graduated into the Metropolitan Opera's corps de ballet and danced with the American Ballet, a company founded by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, when it became the Metropolitan's resident ballet troupe in 1935. She also studied at the School of American Ballet and with such noted teachers as Anatole Vilzak, Ludmila Shollar and Margaret Craske.         She then abandoned ballet for several years, feeling, as she later said, that it was ''something dragged up from 300 years ago that didn't make any sense and wasn't going anyplace.'' She performed in musical comedies, among them ''Virginia,'' in 1937, ''Great Lady'' (1938), ''Stars in Your Eyes'' (1939) and, in 1952, ''Two's Company.'' She also danced in the Radio City Music Hall corps de ballet for nine months in the late 1930's. Assisted on Film Projects         Miss Kaye was associate artistic director of Ballet Theater from 1977 to 1983. In later years, she also assisted Mr. Ross, by then a well-known film and stage producer and director, in his projects. Miss Kaye served as executive producer of ''The Turning Point,'' a 1977 film whose story was said to have been drawn from her own life, though she denied the rumor. Last summer, she assisted Mr. Ross in his filming of ''Giselle.''         Other credits included work as executive producer or co-producer on the films ''The Last of Sheila,'' ''The Seven Percent Solution,'' ''Nijinsky,'' ''Pennies From Heaven'' and ''The Secret of My Success.''         ''As an American ballerina,'' Miss Kaye wrote in 1950 in Theater Arts magazine, ''I never take anything for granted. I question each tradition, each interpretation, each movement. The answers I have found, sometimes right and sometimes wrong, constitute my contribution to the young American dancer of ballet: not to accept until you understand (at least to your own satisfaction), and not to dance any role, ancient or new, until you do understand. This urge to question and to discover is, I think, the trademark of American ballet.''         Miss Kaye is survived by Mr. Ross. Earlier marriages to Michael Van Buren and Isaac Stern, the violinist, ended in divorce. The funeral is on Monday at 4 P.M. at the Westwood Village Mortuary in Los Angeles.         NORA KAY IS DEAD       
        Hannelore Baron, an artist known for her collages and box assemblages, died of cancer Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Riverdale.         Hannelore Baron, an artist known for her collages and box assemblages, died of cancer Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Riverdale.         Ms. Baron escaped Nazi Germany with her parents, and her work is marked by the gravity, discretion and understated wit of a survivor. She had a special feeling for paper, for the weight of communication it can bear and the weight of history that settles so easily on its edges and surfaces.         She described herself a pacifist and wanted her quietly intense work to convince others of the need to listen. She used letters as symbols of memory and birds as symbols of vulnerability and the need for song.         She had numerous solo shows in New York and last summer was a participant in ''Jewish Themes - Contemporary Artists II'' at the Jewish Museum.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Museum of American Art and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y.         She is survived by her husband, Herman; a son, Mark; a daughter, Julie; a brother, Hans, and two grandchildren.       
        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.       
        Hermione Gingold, the irrepressible English-born comedienne whose tart, quick-witted repartee became her trademark, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived on the East Side.         Hermione Gingold, the irrepressible English-born comedienne whose tart, quick-witted repartee became her trademark, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived on the East Side.         Miss Gingold conquered Broadway in 1953 as the star of the long-running revue ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac''; she last appeared on Broadway as the narrator in Stephen Sondheim's musical entertainment ''Side by Side by Sondheim'' in 1977-78.         To a wider American public she was known as a rambunctious, ribald conversationalist on talk shows, a longtime ''irregular regular'' on ''The Jack Paar Show'' whose rejoinders more recently delighted audiences of the talk-show host Merv Griffin.         Her throaty voice is remembered from Alan Jay Lerner's movie musical ''Gigi'' (1958), in which she and Maurice Chevalier joined in the duet ''I Remember It Well.'' Miss Gingold portrayed a retired courtesan, the scheming grandmother of Leslie Caron.         She also appeared in ''The Music Man'' (1962), as the mayor's wife; ''Bell, Book and Candle'' (1958); again with Mr. Chevalier in ''I'd Rather Be Rich'' (1964), and as Mme. Armfeldt in both the stage and film versions of ''A Little Night Music,'' Mr. Sondheim's musical comedy based on Ingmar Bergman's ''Smiles of a Summer Night.'' In Wartime Revue         Miss Gingold began her career in 1911 as a child actor with Noel Coward in ''Where the Rainbow Ends.'' She acted in Shakespearean plays at the Old Vic.         But thousands of servicemen came to admire her as a comedienne in the long-running London revue ''Sweet and Low.'' Several attempts to extend her career to Broadway, one of them involving Cole Porter, failed in the best theater tradition.         Miss Gingold had her first acting engagement in this country at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., in March 1951. The vehicle was ''It's About Time,'' an intimate revue that incorporated some of her material from London.         The title proved prophetic, for '' John Murray Anderson's Almanac'' made her an instant Broadway favorite when it opened in December 1953. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it the ''funniest revue Broadway has played host to for a long time.'' Mr. Atkinson singled out one of her skits with Billy De Wolfe, in which ''Miss Gingold and Mr. De Wolfe act like a couple of geniuses.''         ''It seems like a long time since anyone acted a revue sketch with as much craft and subtlety,'' he said. ''Almanac'' ran for 227 performances, and Miss Gingold won the Donaldson Award in 1954 for her performance.         Miss Gingold acted on the straw-hat theater circuit in summer with, among others plays, Terence Rattigan's ''Sleeping Prince'' and one of her earlier London successes, Noel Coward's ''Fallen Angels.''         Another one of her roles, both on Broadway and in summer stock, was that of the fastidious mother in Arthur Kopit's ''Oh, Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad.'' 'I'm a Celebrity'         She was a tall, vibrant woman with a mobile face, large, heavy-lidded blue eyes and tousled blond hair. She delighted in television, and one of her funniest moments came on a show when she was asked whether her most recent husband was dead. ''That's a matter of opinion,'' she replied.         ''Fighting is essentially a masculine idea,'' she observed on another occasion. ''A woman's weapon is her tongue.''         On the eve of her 80th birthday, while in the cast of ''Side by Side,'' she ruefully reflected that she had always wanted to be in ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''Hamlet.'' She said: ''The trouble with me is that I'm not considered an actress anymore. I'm a celebrity.''         At 66, asked about retirement, Miss Gingold said, ''I suppose I shall drop dead in the theater, to a full house, I hope.''         Miss Gingold participated in benefits and fund raisers for causes ranging from the theater to cancer research. She wrote articles and revue sketches, a play, ''Abracadabra,' as well as a tongue-in-cheek autobiography, ''The World Is Square: My Own Unaided Work.''         Hermione Ferdinanda Gingold was born in London to an English mother and an Austrian father. She was privately educated in London and Paris.         Among her survivors are a sister and two grandchildren, all of Britain.       
        Sister Mary Theresa Brentano, a Benedictine nun who was a pioneer in the use of electronics in the classroom, died of a stroke Sunday at the Mount St. Scholastica Convent, Atchison, Kan. She was 84 years old. In 1957, while she was principal of St. Scholastica Academy in Covington, La., she designed and put to use an electronic system for teaching children through tape recordings.         Sister Mary Theresa Brentano, a Benedictine nun who was a pioneer in the use of electronics in the classroom, died of a stroke Sunday at the Mount St. Scholastica Convent, Atchison, Kan. She was 84 years old. In 1957, while she was principal of St. Scholastica Academy in Covington, La., she designed and put to use an electronic system for teaching children through tape recordings.         Children in the same class could listen to one of four taped lessons made by the teacher. If a student wanted help, pressing a button would get the teacher's attention. The teacher in turn could communicate with any one student.         Sister Mary Theresa told an interviewer at the time that she considered the system means of tailoring instruction to be closer to individuals' needs and farther from mass education.         She was born on a farm in Kansas and took her vows in 1927. She was a graduate of Catholic University and the University of Kansas, where she received a doctorate in English.       
        Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Geraldine Page, dedicated to acting for more than four decades and long identified with the work of Tennessee Williams, died of a heart attack Saturday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Both a Broadway star and an Academy Award winner, she was 62 years old.         Miss Page, who had been performing in ''Blithe Spirit'' on Broadway since spring, did not arrive for Saturday's two performances. At the end of the evening show, the play's producer, Karl Allison, announced that she had died. Her role in ''Blithe Spirit'' was assumed by her understudy, Patricia Conolly.         Mr. Allison described the other members of the cast as devastated by the news. ''She was such a wonderfully sweet person, on top of being such an extraordinary actress,'' he said.         Born in Kirksville, Mo., on Nov. 22, 1924, Miss Page grew up in Chicago and later traced her love of acting to plays that she had done with a church youth group. 'To Be Good at Something'         ''I always wanted to be good at something, to be somebody,'' she once wrote in a sketch of herself for The New Yorker. ''The minute I got into my first play, which was called ''Excuse My Dust'' - I was 17 at the time - I knew that this was what I'd been looking for.''         After graduating from high school in 1942, Miss Page spent three years studying at the Goodman Theater School in Chicago. With 11 other students - they each chipped in $35 - she formed a stock theater company that operated for four seasons from a playhouse outside the city.         In the late 1940's, Miss Page moved to New York, where she worked as a hat-check girl, a spool winder in a thread factory and a negligee model while stalking the theater district for work.         ''The first rule of survival was to stretch every penny,'' she once said. ''I'd eat in a restaurant that featured soup and free rolls for 15 cents and I'd stuff my pockets with rolls. Fortunately, food didn't mean much to me.'' First Big Break in '52         Her first big acting break came in 1952, when the director Jose Quintero cast her as the lovelorn Alma Winemiller in his production of Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' which played Off Broadway at the Circle in the Square.         In that role, she attracted such praise that the next year she made her Broadway debut, in ''Midsummer'' by Vina Delmar. Though the show received mediocre reviews, the critics once again raved about Miss Page, and the producers raised her to star billing.         On Broadway, she went on to star in ''The Immoralist'' in 1954, an adaption of the Gide novel; in N. Richard Nash's ''Rainmaker,'' also in 1954, and in Williams's ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' in 1959.         More recently, she appeared in John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God'' in 1982, and Off Broadway in Sam Shepard's ''Lie of the Mind'' in 1985.         Miss Page was perhaps best known for her interpretations of Williams's obsessive heroines. In 1980 she played Zelda Fitzgerald in the Williams drama ''Clothes for a Summer Hotel.'' 'Disciplined and Dedicated'         The playwright once described her as ''the most disciplined and dedicated of actresses.''         She rejected another characterization of her - as an actress best suited to the roles of neurotic women. ''It's a myth based on nothing,'' she said.         ''A lot of people say I always play neurotic women,'' she said. ''Well, who doesn't play neurotic women?''         The career of Miss Page, who shunned many of the trappings of stardom, was marked by periods of relative obscurity broken by sudden rediscovery. In 1962, with the release of the film versions of ''Summer and Smoke'' and ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' she found herself, after 10 years on the stage, being hailed as an ''overnight success.''         ''That's the longest night I've ever seen,'' she said at the time.         Miss Page's film credits included ''Hondo,'' in which she played opposite John Wayne, in 1954; ''The Happiest Millionaire'' in 1967, and ''The Day of the Locust'' in 1975. In recent years, she appeared in ''The Pope of Greenwich Village'' in 1984 and ''The Trip to Bountiful'' in 1985. A Belated Oscar         Nominated for an Oscar eight times without winning, Miss Page finally received the award for best actress for her performance in ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' In the movie, she played Carrie Watts, an old woman who finally fulfills her long desire to return to her childhood home of Bountiful, a Texas town that has by then disappeared. Of her performance, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''As Mrs. Watts, Geraldine Page has never been in better form or in more control of that complex, delicate mechanism that makes her one of our finest actresses.''         ''She was not a gal who worried about the fashion of the times,'' said the playwright, Horton Foote, a longtime friend of the actress and the author of the screenplay for ''The Trip to Bountiful.'' ''She had enormous individuality. She just wasn't a theater provincial and her work reflected that.''         In the New Yorker sketch, Miss Page gave her own views on what makes a successful actor: ''The main thing is the ability to control your instrument, which in the actor, is yourself. Look the way you want the character to look. Sound the way you want the character to sound. Once you've trained the instrument to do what you want, you're in control and you're free.''         Despite her successful Hollywood career, Miss Page remained a strong supporter of repertory theater throughout her life, often acting in them at a low salary and in supporting roles. Recently, as a member of the Mirror Repertory Company, she appeared in ''The Madwoman of Chaillot.''         Miss Page won two Emmy awards for her television performances, both in the late 1960's for roles in adaptations of Truman Capote stories, ''A Christmas Memory'' and ''The Thanksgiving Visitor.''         Miss Page is survived by her third husband, the actor Rip Torn; their three children, Jonathan, Anthony and Angelica Torn-Burkhardt; a grandchild, Elija Burkhardt, and a brother, Donald.         A memorial service will be held at the Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52d Street, at 11 A.M. on Wednesday.

        Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Pola Negri, a tempestuous green-eyed vamp of the silent screen who tantalized audiences with her on- and off-camera romances, died Saturday at Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio. She was 88 years old and lived in San Antonio.         Miss Negri was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia last week, hospital officials said yesterday. Her physician, Dr. Houston Wade, said she had been diagnosed two years ago as having a brain tumor. She decided not to undergo treatment, he said.         There were believed to be no survivors.  ----  Most Exotic of Stars         The 1920's and 30's were the Age of the Vamp in the movies, and of all the screen vamps, Pola Negri was, unquestionably, the most colorful, the most exotic, the most mysterious.         The Polish-born Miss Negri was a startlingly beautiful woman, with skin as delicately white as fine porcelain, jet black hair and flashing dark-green eyes.         Her off-screen life was more tempestuous than any role she ever played and, although she often insisted that she wished only to be left alone, she could shrewdly maneuver her love affairs and feuds into avalanches of personal publicity.         Men found her fascinating. She married two noblemen and divorced both. She was the mistress and fiancee of Charles Chaplin, whom she jilted in a whirl of headlines. She was living openly with Rudolph Valentino, the romantic idol of millions of women the world over, at the time of his death in 1926. And Adolf Hitler was so taken with her that he personally intervened to countermand an order, issued by the Nazis on the ground that they thought Miss Negri was part-Jewish, forbidding her to work in Germany.         The temperamental star flourished in the long-gone era of the flamboyant screen siren, competing for roles and popularity with such other stars as Gloria Swanson and Theda Bara. Festooned in Diamonds         Whenever she appeared in public, she was festooned in diamonds and pearl brooches from her $1 million collection, acquired cut-rate from Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns who could no longer afford them. She popularized painted toenails in the mid-20's, and when she took to wearing turbans, or appeared in high boots, thousands of American women slavishly copied her.         She maintained a mansion in Beverly Hills, a villa on the Riviera and a chateau north of Paris, and just before the crash of 1929 her personal fortune was estimated at $5 million. She lost most of her money and possessions, however, and spent her last years living in elegant simplicity in San Antonio.         In ''Memoirs of a Star,'' published in 1970, Miss Negri wrote that she was born in Lipno, Poland, on New Year's Eve, 1899. (Other sources, however, give the date as three to five years earlier.) Her mother was the former Eleanora de Kielczeska, from a family of impoverished nobility; her father was Jerzy Mathias-Chalupec, a Slovak immigrant.         Miss Negri's two sisters died in childhood. Her father was arrested by Czarist troops in 1905 for revolutionary activity in what was then Russian Poland. He was sent to prison and, although he was ultimately released, he did not return to his wife and daughter.         Miss Negri's mother had to go to work as a cook to maintain a one-room apartment in a Warsaw slum and earn enough money to send Pola to the Imperial Ballet School. Pola's first public performance was in the role of a cygnet in ''Swan Lake,'' with the Imperial Ballet. Illness Ended Dance Career         Her dancing career ended when she was 13 years old, however, because she contracted tuberculosis and had to be sent to a sanitarium. Pronounced cured a year later, she returned to Warsaw and was admitted for study at the Imperial Academy of Dramatic Arts after falsely stating she was 17. It was at that time that she adopted her stage name - Pola, the diminutive of her given name, Apolonia, and Negri, after Ada Negri, an Italian poet whom she admired.         She was one of Poland's leading actresses when she was 17, at which time she made her first movie, a two-reeler called ''Slaves of Sin.'' In 1918 she went to Berlin to perform a leading role in Max Reinhardt's pantomime ''Sumurun,'' which was later filmed as her third full-length movie.         Miss Negri's roles in her first two pictures, ''The Eyes of the Mummy Ma'' and ''Carmen,'' typed her as the man-ruining vamp. She took time out from her career in 1919 to be the wife, briefly, of Count Eugene Dambski, a Polish army career officer, then returned to Berlin to make films. ''Madame Du Barry,'' released in the United States under the title ''Passion,'' won her a Paramount Pictures contract and she was brought here in 1922.         During the Atlantic crossing, Miss Negri's agent scolded her for spending most of her time in her cabin. ''Make a few appearances,'' he said. ''Think of the publicity.''         ''I am thinking of it,'' she replied. ''We will get more publicity this way. I have already learned that the fewer appearances you make, the more they will talk about you. All you have to do is to say you want to be alone - and the whole world thinks you are exotic and glamorous. It never occurs to them that you are simply tired.'' Feud With Swanson         In Hollywood, while carefully limiting her public appearances, Miss Negri, with equal assiduity, cultivated several headlined feuds, most notably with Gloria Swanson, her rival at Paramount. (The leading ladies once had a cat fight using real cats.) Miss Negri's Hollywood films were not artistic landmarks, but most were extremely successful at the box office. Among them were ''Belle Donna'' (1923), her first American movie; ''The Cheat'' (1923); ''Men'' (1924); ''The Spanish Dancer'' (1923); ''Shadows of Paris'' (1924); ''East of Suez'' (1925) and ''Forbidden Paradise'' (1924). At the height of her popularity, she was so much in demand that she ground out five pictures in a single year.         However, she always seemed able to find time for romance. Her first big headlined Hollywood affair was with Charlie Chaplin, who in 1964 wrote in his autobiography that the relationship was essentially one of the pursued (Chaplin) and the pursuer (Negri). In her own memoirs Miss Negri observed tartly:         ''A great deal has been written about my relationship with Charlie Chaplin. Unfortunately, much of it has been written by Mr. Chaplin. Still less fortunately, what he wrote was largely untrue. Rather than say he behaved in less than a gentlemanly fashion, I would prefer to excuse him on the grounds that all clowns live in a world of fantasy.''         Miss Negri went on to say that her relationship with Mr. Chaplin had been intimate and stormy, that he was an inept lover, that he proposed marriage and that finally she ended the affair, over Mr. Chaplin's tearful entreaties. Her Greatest Love         According to Miss Negri, the greatest love of her life was Rudolph Valentino. On their second meeting, she wrote in her memoirs, she found him so passionately overpowering that on that very night they became lovers and remained so for nearly a year, until his death in 1926.         Valentino, called by his adoring public ''The Great Lover,'' was indeed the great lover, she wrote, capable of making such romantic gestures as sprinkling rose petals on the bed before they retired. He could also be quite prosaic. For example, he often wept because he was losing his hair, and sometimes the sex symbol of American women preferred making spaghetti for Miss Negri to making love to her.         After collapsing at Valentino's funeral in New York, Miss Negri took his body back to California by train, stopping at dozens of stations along the way so that hysterical Valentino-worshipers could pay him tribute. She was accused of using the cortege to garner personal publicity, and, true or not, soon afterward her popularity at the box office waned. When her contract came up for renewal, she found she was no longer wanted at Paramount.         Her standing with the Valentino cult was forever shattered when, in 1927, less than a year after Valentino's death, Miss Negri was married to Serge Mdivani, an impecunious Georgian prince, and took him to live in her chateau in France. They were divorced in 1931, after Miss Negri had lost the bulk of her fortune through, she later wrote, her husband's mismanagement of her affairs during the stock-market crisis. Went to Berlin in 1935         After the indifferent reception to her first talkie, ''A Woman Commands,'' Miss Negri in 1935 fled Hollywood for Berlin, where she made pictures until the outbreak of World War II. For a time she was prohibited from working by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, who put her name on a list of suspected ''non-Aryans.''         Hitler, who was said to be so fond of her German-made movie about mother love, ''Mazurka,'' that he had it run weekly so he could have a good cry, personally overruled Goebbels. Shortly after, newspapers in Europe and the United States printed reports of a romance between Hitler and Miss Negri. She sued the French magazine that initiated the reports and won a 10,000-franc judgment.         Miss Negri, who was living on the Riviera when Germany invaded France, returned to the United States in 1941. Two years later she played a featured comedy role in ''Hi Diddle Diddle,'' but no other film offers were forthcoming.         By the end of the war, she was reduced to living in one room in a small hotel in New York and selling off her jewelry to survive. Ultimately, she recovered some money and property tied up in Europe during the war.         From 1948 to 1963, Miss Negri lived in California and Texas with Margaret L. West, who bequeathed her property in San Antonio. In recent years Miss Negri lived in a duplex apartment in San Antonio, attended by a maid, a chauffeur and a secretary.         Miss Negri made her last attempted comeback in ''The Moonspinners,'' a Walt Disney film released in 1964. As production on the movie began in London in 1963, she proved she had not lost her knack for finding a bizarre gimmick sure to give her headlines. For her first press conference, she entered the room with a frisky cheetah on a leash.

Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Miss Kryl was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1897, but lived most of her early life in Chicago, where she studied with the well-known pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz.         Her father, Bohumir Kryl, a bank president, art collector, composer and bandmaster, so wanted his daughters, Marie and Josephine, to become musicians that, in 1921, he promised them each $100,000 if they would not marry before reaching age 30. They both agreed.         But neither daughter lived up to her vow. Josephine, a violinist of note, married the composer Paul Taylor White before turning 30. Marie forfeited her fortune when, in 1926, she became engaged to a Greek Count, Spiro Hadji-Kyriacos. A year later, however, the engagement was broken, and in 1932, she married Michel Gusikoff, a composer and a former assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony.
