         Eleanor Schley Todd, a former Republican National Committeewoman, died on Monday at her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.         She was also active in civic affairs. In 1983, Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Board of Higher Education, where she served until 1988. She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.         Mrs. Todd was born in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and was educated at the Chapin School, the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., Barnard and Sarah Lawrence Colleges and at Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1967.         She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         Elinor Cocheran Ayers, a former high school teacher who became a leading dog breeder, died on Wednesday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. She was 62 years old and lived in Manchester, Vt. No cause of death was given.         Beginning in 1972, when she moved to Manchester and re-established the Seaward Kennels, which had been started by her mother in 1932, Miss Ayers became a major dog breeder. She specialized in American, Canadian Black and Landseer Newfoundlands.         Her greatest victory came in 1984 when Ch. Seaward's Blackbeard became the only Newfoundland ever to be named best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club's annual fixture at Madison Square Garden.         Before her dog-breeding career, Miss Ayers taught at the Ferry Hall School in Lake Forest, Ill., worked as a guidance counselor at Danbury (Conn.) High School and served as dean of girls at Montclair (N.J.) High School. She is survived by a brother, Stewart ayers, Of St. Petersburg, Fla.       
         The Rev. Marilyn Adams Moore, an executive with the United Church of Christ, died Jan. 3 at her home in Dayton, N.J. She was 57 years old.         She died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Ms. Moore had served as secretary for racial and social justice with the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ since 1988. She worked on programs to help the clergy and laity respond to social issues and initiated programs to help immigrant women and the homeless.         Before that, she was assistant minister of St. Alban's Congregational Church in Queens.         A graduate of New York Theological Seminary, Ms. Moore was ordained in 1982. She also held positions with the National Council of Churches and the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. She was a member of the Central Jersey Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         She is survived by two daughters, Sharon-Frances and Meredith, both of Dayton; and two brothers, Edward B. Adams of Austin, Tex., and Dr. Clarence Lancelot Adams of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Allison Moore Coudert, a philanthropist who was active in civic causes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of pneumonia, said her daughter, Allison P. Coudert of Tempe, Ariz.         Mrs. Coudert was a member of the A.S.P.C.A.'s Founder's Society and supported museums and social welfare organizations in New York. She was past secretary of the Child Adoption Service of the Children's Aid Society and had been treasurer of the Oyster Bay Visiting Nurse Association on Long Island for many years. She attended Vassar College and served on the board of the Women's City Club.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Alexis, of McLean, Va.; a sister, Nina Moore Galston of Huntington, L.I.; a granddaughter, and a great-grandson.       
         Princess Ileana of Romania, who was known as Mother Alexandra after becoming a nun, died at midday yesterday in St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, Mother Christophora, abbess of the Monastery of the Holy Transfiguration, said.         An aunt of former King Michael of Romania, she was 82 years old and had been a nun at the monastery, which is a community of nuns of the Orthodox Church in America in Ellwood City in western Pennsylvania, for 22 years.         Mother Alexandra, who founded the convent in 1968 and was its abbess from 1969 to 1980, fractured her hip in a fall there on Jan. 4, entered the hospital that night, suffered a massive heart attack on Jan. 8 and died of heart failure, Mother Christophora said.         She was born Jan. 5, 1909, the youngest of the five children of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Romania, and was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.  Brother Becomes King         Her eldest brother became King Carol II of Romania, and at his behest she was married in her early 20's to Archduke Anton of the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and left Romania. She returned to her homeland in 1940 but was forced to leave in 1948 by the Communist Government.         She eventually came to the United States, carrying an heirloom diamond and sapphire tiara wrapped in a nightgown, and settled in Newton, Mass. She divorced the Archduke, who had served in the German Air Force during World War II, in 1954 and supported herself and her children by giving lectures on such topics as her life, Romania and world peace.         Her second marriage, to Dr. Stefan Issarescu, ended in divorce and then, with her children grown up, she became a nun of the Orthodox Church in the convent of the Protection of the Holy Virgin in Bussy-en-Othe in east-central France before going on to found the convent in Pennsylvania. After retiring as abbess at that convent, she continued an active life there and as a speaker on religious topics around the country.         She traveled to Romania in September, her first visit since 1948, to see the graves of her parents.  Author of Several Books         Her writings include a volume of memoirs, "I Live Again" (1952), and several books on spiritual and religious subjects including "Meditations on the Nicene Creed" (1958).         She is survived by three daughters from her first marriage, Alexandra, who lives in West Germany, and Magdalene and Elisabeth, who live in Austria; and two sons, Stefan, of Detroit, and Dominic, of Venice.         The former King Michael, who was ejected from Romania by the Communists shortly before Princess Ileana, now lives in Geneva.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Adele Lawrence Auchincloss, an artist, environmentalist and former deputy administrator of the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, died on Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of bone marrow cancer, her husband, the writer Louis Auchincloss, said.         Mrs. Auchincloss, a past president of the New York Parks Council and of the Park Association, was appointed deputy administrator of parks in 1974 by Mayor Abraham D. Beame and served for one year, until the post fell victim to the city's fiscal crisis.         A 1953 graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she also attended the Parsons School of Design. She was a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York Botanical Garden. In 1980, she was president of the Central Park Task Force.         She designed covers for her husband's novels and was the co-author of a forthcoming centennial history of the New York Botanical Garden.         Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, John and Andrew, both lawyers, of Manhattan, and Blake, an architect, of Mansfield, Mass; a sister, Susan Winchester of Prides Crossing, Mass., and one granddaughter.       
         Aryness Joy Wickens, an economist and statistician who played the crucial role in developing the Government's cost-of-living index, now the Consumer Price Index, died last Saturday at the Lakeland Health Care Center in Jackson, Miss. She was 90 years old and lived in Jackson.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wickens retired from the Department of Labor in 1970 after a 42-year career in Fderal service that began when she joined the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in 1928 after having taught at Mount Holyoke College for four years.         In 1933 she served on a committee organized by the American Statistical Association to advise Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins on setting up the Bureau of Labor Statistics program. A few years later she directed the bureau's studies for the Temporary National Economic Committee's investigation of monopolistic practices in industry.         When the bureau was reorganized in 1940, Mrs. Wickens became chief of the branch studying prices and the cost of living. From 1946 to 1961 she was assistant and then deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics.         In 1952 she was president of the American Statistical Association. Eight years later, in recognition of her outstanding Government service, she was one of six recipients of the first Federal Women's Awards of the Civil Service Commission. Adviser at U.N. Conferences         In 1961, after having been a United States adviser at many United Nations and other international conferences, Mrs. Wickens was named economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor. In that post she laid the statistical base for what became the department's Manpower Administration and its Employment and Training Administration.         After retirement Mrs. Wickens served on the advisory board of the United States Export-Import Bank. In 1976 she returned to government work as director of statistical studies for the Commission on Federal Paperwork.         Mrs. Wickens was born in Bellingham, Wash. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington and held a master's degree from the University of Chicago. She lived near Vienna, Va., before moving to Jackson four years ago.         Her husband, David L. Wickens, an economist, died in 1970. She is survived by a son, Donaldson, of Jackson, and three grandsons.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Baldwin Folinsbee, a community leader and former government official in New Hope, Pa., died Wednesday at her home in New Hope. She was 100 years old and died in her sleep, said her daughter, Elizabeth Wiggins of New Hope.         Mrs. Folinsbee was involved in civic activities in her community and was a founder of the New Hope Public Health Association. In 1966, at the age of 75, she was elected to the Borough Council of New Hope and served until 1969.         Her husband, the landscape artist, John F. Folinsbee, died in 1972. In addition to her daughter, Elizabeth, she is survived by another daughter, Joan Cook of Princeton, N.J.; 7 grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Hill McGregor, a cello and ensemble teacher at the School for Strings on West 54th Street, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, the hospital said.         Mrs. McGregor graduated from Smith College in 1930 and then studied cello with Felix Salmond at Juilliard. With her friend Dorothy Fay Little, she founded the Greenwood Music Camp, a summer camp for children in Cummington, Mass., and served as a director there for 50 years.         She was treasurer of the Amateur Chamber Music Players for 25 years. Before joining the School for Strings, she was the director of instrumental music at the Chapin School and also taught at the Brearley School.         She is survived by her husband, Rumsey; a daughter, Louise Griggs of Hanover, N.H.; a son, David, of Forest Hills, Queens; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Virginia Mae Brown, who as chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission became the first woman to head an independent administrative agency of the Federal Government, died Sunday at her home in Charleston, W. Va. She was 67 years old.         The cause of death was a heart attack, said her daughter, Pamela Kay Brown.         Mrs. Brown, a lawyer, served as an I.C.C. commissioner from 1964 to 1979, was vice chairman of the commission in 1968 and was named chairman for a one-year term in 1969.         Mrs. Brown, an appointee of President Lyndon B. Johnson, also was the first woman to serve on the commission, which was founded in 1887.         She was also the first woman to be an assistant attorney general for West Virginia, a post she held from 1952 to 1961. After serving from January to May 1961 as counsel to Gov. William W. Barron of West Virginia, she became the state's first female insurance commissioner. And in 1962 she became the first female member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission. An Administrative Law Judge         After leaving the I.C.C. in 1979, Mrs. Brown returned to West Virginia, where she was an administrative law judge for the Federal Department of Labor in Charleston and later for the Social Security Administration there.

         Cora DuBois, an anthropologist, teacher and author who was an authority on Southeast Asia, died Sunday at a nursing home in Brookline, Mass. She was 87 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of pneumonia and heart failure, her secretary, Eric Davis, said.         Dr. DuBois was the Zimurray Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University and Radcliffe College when she retired in 1969. In World War II, she served with the Office of Strategic Services. She was later with the State Department, the Institute of International Education and the Far Eastern Association.         In 1938 Dr. DuBois, who had taught anthropology at Hunter College, went to live in Alor, a small island in the Dutch East Indies. Living alone in a house in a remote mountain village, she learned the local language and was able to win the confidence of villagers by giving simple medical aid. Study of Islanders         The result of her 18-month inquiry was "The People of Alor," a social and psychological study published in 1944 that won acclaim for its thoroughness and lucidity. She also wrote "Social Forces in Southeast Asia," which appeared in 1949, and her writings were widely published in scholarly journals.         Dr. DuBois was a graduate of Barnard College, where she worked under the anthropologists Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. She received her doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley after extensive ethnographic studies of Indian tribes in the American Northwest.         When she returned from Alor, Dr. DuBois tought at Sarah Lawrence College before joining the Office of Strategic Services in 1942 as chief of its Indonesia section. She later became chief of research and analysis for the Army's Southeast Asia Command.         The Army awarded Dr. DuBois the Exceptional Civilian Award, and she also received the Order of the Crown of Thailand for her participation in the Free Thai underground movement through the O.S.S. From 1945 to 1949 she was Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the State Department's Office of Intelligence Research.         In 1951 Dr. DuBois was named to direct a study of educational needs and resources of third world areas. In 1954 she was appointed director of the Far Eastern Association and at the same time returned to academic life with her appointment at Harvard and Radcliffe.         Dr. DuBois was president of the American Anthropological Associaton in 1968-69 and of the Association for Asian Studies in 1969-70.         She leaves no immediate family survivors. Her longtime companion was Jeanne Taylor.       
         Sarah Jane Kinoy, a teacher and social worker who was an early leader in the education of children with cerebral palsy, died on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 96 years old and had lived in Manhattan and Tompkins Corners, N.Y.         She died of heart failure, said her son Ernest.         Mrs. Kinoy, a graduate of Teachers College, was a social worker with the American Red Cross during World War I and later taught at the Brooklyn Ethical Culture School and at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         She was a founder of the Brooklyn Community School in the early 1940's and was executive director of the New York Service for Orthopedic Handicapped. At Teachers College she coordinated the special education department for children with cerebral palsy and in the 1950's, in cooperation with the New York City Board of Education, she developed a pilot school for Manhattan children with the disease. She later served as director of services for Cerebral Palsy of Queens.         She is survived by two sons, Ernest, a television writer, of Williamsville, Vt., and Arthur of Montclair, N.J., a Rutgers University law professor; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Shatz, a cattle breeder and civic leader, died on Sunday at her home in Coral Gables, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She died in her sleep, a family spokeswoman said.         Before moving to Florida in 1955, Mrs. Shatz and her late husband, Hyman, operated Phileidor Farms in Carmel, N.Y., where they bred prize Guernsey cows. Mrs. Shatz also served as vice president and director of the Mahopac Hospital, now known as the Putnam Hospital Center in Carmel, and was active in the Red Cross.

         Harriet Fleischl Pilpel, a lawyer and civil libertarian who was a prominent advocate of women's rights, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Pilpel died of a heart attack, her husband said.         Last Wednesday, she received an award from the New York Civil Liberties Foundation, one of many such awards she had received. At her death she was first vice chairwoman of the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.         Mrs. Pilpel, a frequent guest on the television program "Firing Line" with William F. Buckley Jr., was associated with the Manhattan law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which she joined in 1982. Throughout her career she lectured extensively on freedom of speech and the press, birth control, abortion and related subjects. She also spoke on the status of women and literary and entertainment law.  Served on Rights Panel         In the 1960's, she was a member of the Kennedy and Johnson Commissions on the Status of Women, serving on the committee on political and civil rights. From 1970 to 1978, she was chairwoman of the Law Panel International of Planned Parenthood Federation. She was also a consultant to the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor from 1965 to 1976 and general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union from 1979 to 1986.         She was also general counsel for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and special counsel for Planned Parenthood of New York City. In 1974, she was a founding member of the Women's Forum, an organization of women of achievement and influence from diverse fields.         In 1961, she argued successfully for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America against a suit asking the Supreme Court to rule on Connecticut laws that would have made it a crime to use birth-control devices or for doctors to advise their use. The Court declined 5 to 4 to rule on the laws.         In 1965, Mrs. Pilpel represented Dr. Benjamin Spock in a free-speech suit over whether advertising in his best-seller "Baby and Child Care," violated the public interest. The court ruled against Dr. Spock, who sought to block the ads.         She graduated from Vassar College in 1932 and received a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School in 1933. She received a law degree from Columbia in 1936.         She is survived by her husband, Irvin B. Schwartz, executive administrator for psychiatry at New York Medical College; two children from a former marriage to Robert C. Pilpel, an executive at the Hudson Guild Settlement House, who died in 1987; a daughter, Judith E. Appelbaum, and a son, Robert H. Pilpel, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Juliette Brudney of Cambridge, Mass., and Ruth Frank of Sanibel, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Gladys Marcus, dean of liberal arts at the Fashion Institute of Technology, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Marcus joined the faculty at the Fashion Institute of Technology as a part-time instructor in 1950. Before the year was out she had switched to full-time teaching. She left in 1952 to devote herself to her family. She returned to the institute in 1957 and, in 1977, was named dean of liberal arts.         She was instrumental in expanding and maintaining a broad-based liberal arts program at the school as part of its career-oriented degree programs. A proponent of global education, she initiated an overseas curriculum for the fashion institute. She was a member of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools visiting teams evaluating other colleges.         A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of New York University. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and received an M.A. from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.         From 1943 to 1946, she served in the Navy as a lieutenant.         She is survived by a son Bret, of Manhattan, news director at WNBC-TV.       
         Coral Lansbury, an author, Victorian scholar and dean of the Graduate School of English at Rutgers University's Camden campus, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 61 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lansbury, who had written a number of scholarly literary works, began writing fiction late in her career when her cousin, the actress Angela Lansbury, said to her seven years ago, "Darling, are you going to go on all your life writing those dreary academic books that nobody reads?"         The result was "Sweet Alice," which E. P. Dutton brought out in 1986 and which Publishers Weekly praised as a "slightly naughty tale of greed, goodness and British breeding." Her second novel, "Ringarra," a Gothic tale, reached readers in 1985, even before "Sweet Alice" appeared. 'Mythic Quality' to Writing         In quick succession there followed "Felicity" (1987) a farce, and "The Grotto" (1989), whose writing was praised by John Mortimer in The New York Times Book Review for its "energy, good humor and mythic quality." Alfred A. Knopf will publish her fifth novel, "Opium!," next year.         Ms. Lansbury was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1929 to British parents who were touring in a production of the musical "Showboat." The family was stranded by the Great Depression and Ms. Lansbury graduated from North Sydney Girls High School, a selective institution, and entered the University of Sydney at age 15.         A year later her father, who had become a sound-effects man in the country's fledgling radio industry, got her a part in a drama on the air. She worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation into the 1960's but as television supplanted radio drama she turned more to academic interests, publishing articles and lecturing widely.         Ms. Lansbury came to the United States and joined the Rutgers faculty at Camden in 1974. She wrote four books on Anthony Trollope and other Victorian literary figures between 1975 and 1984. She served as president of the Victorian Studies Association and of the Victorian executive committee of the Modern Language Association.         She is survived by a son, Malcolm Turnbull of Sydney, and two grandchildren.       
         Marion Vannett Ridgway, who served as an agent for artists and writers for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 88 years old.         She died of pneumonia and vascular disease, said Elizabeth Park, a friend of more than 20 years.         Ms. Ridgway graduated from the Halstead School in Yonkers and studied art and design in Manhattan. For 40 years she operated Marion Ridgway, artist representative, at 299 Madison Avenue in Manhattan and represented commerical artists, photographers and writers for publishers and advertising concerns.         Early in her career, she wrote 11 books for children.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Wilhelmina Harris, for nearly four decades the superintendent of the Adams Presidential Family National Historic Site in Quincy, Mass., died on May 20 at her home in Quincy. She was 95 years old.         She died of a heart ailment, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service said.         Mrs. Harris had been associated with the heirs of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams since the early 1920's, when she became social secretary to Brooks Adams, a historian and a fourth-generation family member who died in 1927.         In 1948 Mrs. Harris joined the staff of the historic site, which includes the birthplace of both Presidents and the summer White House they maintained. She was named superintendent in 1950 and served until she retired in 1987 at the age of 91.         Mrs. Harris was born in Franklin, Ala., and was a graduate of Montevallo College in Alabama.         Her husband, Col. Frank E. Harris, whom she married in 1928, died in 1947. Surviving are three sons, Frank 3d of Salt Lake City, George, of Washington, and Brooks, of Philadelphia; 11 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Margaret L. Suckley, an aide and confidante of Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and an archivist at the nation's first Presidential Library at Hyde Park, N.Y., died on Saturday at Wilderstein, her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 99 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Miss Suckley, who was known as Daisy, was a distant cousin and close neighbor of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and lived her entire life in the landmark house overlooking the Hudson River near Hyde Park built by her grandfather in 1852.         In 1940, Miss Suckley, who raised Scottish terriers, gave the President a puppy he named Fala. The dog soon became the country's most photographed animal. Miss Suckley was the co-author of a children's book about Fala and took part in producing two short films depicting the dog's life in the limelight. Center of Political Uproar         Fala became the center of a political uproar in the 1944 Presidential campaign, when Republicans charged that the Navy had sent a warship to rescue the dog after he had been left behind during a visit by President Roosevelt to the Aleutian Islands. The President turned the story to his advantage by expressing mock indignation that his Republican adversaries would attack "even my little dog Fala."         Miss Suckley was largely invisible to the general public although she traveled with the President on wartime inspection trips and to meetings with heads of state and allied military leaders. She was at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Ga., when President Roosevelt suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage on April 12, 1945.         She continued on the staff of the Roosevelt Library until she retired in 1963. She often spoke about the Roosevelt Presidency from her privileged station close to the family but was unassuming and meticulously factual and circumspect in her recollections. Nurse's Aide During War         Miss Suckley was born at Wilderstein and was a descendant of several prominent American families of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Livingstons and Beekmans. She attended Bryn Mawr and during World War I served as a nurse's aide at a military hospital on Ellis Island.         In 1980, she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation, dedicated to the maintenance and public enjoyment of her 45-acre riverfront property whose grounds were designed by Calvert Vaux, the noted 19th century park architect, and whose Queen Anne interiors were the work of J. B. Tiffany. Last year Wilderstein received National Historic Landmark status.         Miss Suckley, the last of seven brothers and sisters, is survived by two nieces, Margaret Hendrick of Annapolis, Md., and Catherine Hambley of Rhinebeck.       
         Dr. Frances Arkin, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who practiced in New York for many years before moving to Miami in 1978, died on July 3 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 87 years old.         She died of a stroke, said her sister, Evelynne Abrams of Middletown, N.Y.         Dr. Arkin, a native of Boston and a graduate of Tufts Medical School, was a founder in 1944 of the first psychoanalytic training program at the New York Medical College, where she was a faculty member for 24 years. Earlier she had served with the New York City Bureau of Child Guidance and had maintained a private practice here.         She was a past president of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis. For 17 years before she retired in 1986, Dr. Arkin was a consultant in training of psychiatric residents at the Miami Veterans Hospital.         Her longtime companion was Janine Rolland of Miami. Mrs. Abrams is her only family survivor.       
         Ruth F. Corcoran, who became the first woman to be elected to a Suffolk County town board when she won a seat as a councilwoman in Huntington, L.I., in 1961, died on Friday at the Hilaire Farms Nursing Home in Huntington. She was 81 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a daughter said.         Mrs. Corcoran was a councilwoman from 1961 to 1965. She was also the founder of the Huntington Youth Bureau and served as chairwoman of the Suffolk County Youth Board.         Her husband, Charles R. Corcoran, an insurance executive, died in 1978.         She is survived by four daughters, Lucille Buergers of Hampton Bays, L.I., Mary Ehmann of Winnetka, Ill., Jean Schott of Alexandria, Va., and Ruth Ann Howley of Piscataway, N.J.; a son, Charles A., of Des Moines; 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Sister Elizabeth Cavanagh, a former vice president and dean of students at Manhattanvlle College in Purchase, N.Y., died on Sunday at Kenwood Convent of the Sacred Heart in Albany. She was 77 years old.         She died of bone cancer, Sister Mary Lyman said.         Before her death, Sister Cavanagh was director of pastoral care at San Jose Hospital in San Jose, Calif.         She served as an administrator at Manhattanville from 1953 to 1968. Earlier, she was dean at Newton College in Newton, Mass. She entered the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1935 and began her career in education in 1938 as a teacher at Maplehurst Academy in the Bronx.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.       
         Gisela Warburg Wyzanski, a leader in Zionist women's and youth activities for several decades, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 79 years old.         She died of leukemia, her famlly said.         Mrs. Wyzanski was a longtime national board member of Hadassah, the American women's Zionist organization, and worked in Berlin in the Hitler era with Youth Aliah, a group that resettled Jewish children in Palestine and other countries.         She was born in Hamburg and came to the United States as a refugee in 1939. She served for a quarter century as chairman for the Boston area of the greeting-card fund-raising campaign for Unicef.         Her husband, Charles E. Wyzanski, a former chief judge of Federal District Court in Boston, whom she married in 1943, died in 1986. She is survived by a son, Charles M. Wyzanski of Cambridge, a daughter, Anita Robboy of Cambridge; a sister, Anita Warburg of Manhattan, and four granddaughters.

         Dr. Frances G. Dell, a retired English professor at Pace University, died on Sunday in Beverly Hospital in Beverly, Mass. She was 69 years old and had lived in White Plains until a recent move to Wenham, Mass.         She died of congestive heart failure, a university spokesman said.         Dr. Dell taught at Pace's Westchester-Pleasantville campus for 27 years before retiring in 1990. She was professor emeritus of literature, communications and the performing arts, and she specialized in 19th-century literature, particularly the works of Thomas Hardy, James Fenimore Cooper and the Brontes.         A native of Queens, she graduated from Queens College and held master's degrees from Teachers College, Columbia University and Fordham University, where she also earned a Ph.D. in English.         She represented Pace at three Bronte conferences in England and conducted an international Bronte conference at Pace's Westchester campus in 1985. Her articles on 19th-century fiction appeared in literary publications.         At Pace, she also served on the university Senate, moderated the English Honor Society and for many years was supervisor of student teaching.         She is survived by her husband of 45 years, Dr. Robert Dell, who also is a retired Pace professor of English, and two sons, Douglas, a Nynex executive in Middleton, Mass., and Blair, a law student in Texas.       
         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.         Dr. Weaver is believed to have been the first black woman to earn a doctorate in her field, speech correction, audiology and linguistics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Northwestern.         Dr. Weaver graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1932. She taught in speech departments at Roosevelt College in Chicago and Howard University in Washington, as well as Brooklyn College.         In 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson named her husband Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making him the first black Cabinet member in the nation's history. At first, Dr. Weaver remained at Brooklyn College and the Weavers had a commuter marriage. But, Mr. Weaver said yesterday, it was not satisfactory and she retired in 1967 to join him in Washington.         While there, she served as a consultant to the Women's Job Corps, the National Advisory Research Council of the Institute of Dental Research and the Children's Hearing and Speech Center, an affiliate of Children's Hospital.         Besides her husband, Dr. Weaver is survived by a brother, Hampton D. Haith of Winston-Salem, N.C.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses, whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died Thursday night at her home in South Salem, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill. She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten."         Her most recent New York appearances were in 1987, as O'Neill's wife Carlotta Monterey O'Neill in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival, and on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in his "Ah, Wilderness!"  Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of the Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until May of this year.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant about using her distinctive big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings."         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee-Downer Collegewhere she decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice.         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two sons, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Ms. Dewhurst's first major Broadway role came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero.         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Among her many screen credits was the recent movie "Dying Young," with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!"         Her television appearances included three seasons playing Candice Bergen's mother on "Murphy Brown," for which she won an Emmy Award in 1989. She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.

         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Eva Bertrand Adams, a gold miner's daughter who presided over the United States Mint for eight years, died Friday at a hospital in Reno. Miss Adams was 80 years old and lived in Reno.         The funeral home said she died of natural causes.         Miss Adams was born in Wonder, Nev., a gold-mining town that died when the gold ran out. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada and a master's degree in English from Columbia University.         She taught high school English in Las Vegas before returning to the University of Nevada as an instructor in 1936. She also served as assistant dean of women at the university before beginning a new career in 1940 as the principal aide to Senator Pat McCarran, Republican of Nevada, in Washington.         She continued as administrative assistant to Mr. McCarran until he died in 1954, then served under his interim successor and under Senator Alan Bible, a Democrat elected as Mr. McCarran's permanent replacement.         While working for Senator McCarran, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she received an bachelor of laws degree from George Washington University in 1948 and a doctor of laws degree from the university two years later. She became a member of the bar in her home state and in the District of Columbia, as well as of the Supreme Court bar.         In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named her director of the Mint.         During her tenure, Miss Adams authorized and supervised the construction of a new mint in Philadelphia and the expansion of the Denver Mint. She also battled an acute nationwide coin shortage in the early 1960's that was caused by hoarding and a proliferation of coin-operated vending machines.         President Lyndon B. Johnson reappointed her in 1966 and she retired from the post in September 1969 for yet another career, as a management consultant in Reno.         Miss Adams left no immediate survivors.       
         Ruth G. Schapiro, a nationally known tax lawyer and a partner in the New York firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Donald Schapiro, her husband of 39 years, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Schapiro, a native of Manhattan, was a 1947 graduate of Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where she was notes editor of the Law Review. She went to work in 1951 at the firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and joined the Proskauer firm in 1955.         President Carter appointed Mrs. Schapiro to the Tax Court Nominating Commission in 1978, and she served as a member of the panel until 1981. At the time of her death, she was chairwoman of the committee on personal income taxes of the New York City State Bar Association.         She was a past chairwoman of the state bar's tax section, as well as of its finance committee, and served on the executive committee of the state bar's House of Delegates. From 1984 to 1989, she also headed a special committee on women in the courts set up by the state bar.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Schapiro's survivors include a daughter, Jane G., also of Manhattan; a son, Robert A., of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of United States District Court in Manhattan.       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.

         Catherine M. Prelinger, a Yale lecturer, author and historian, died on Saturday at the Yale Health Plan Care Center in New Haven. She was 66 years old and lived in Killingsworth, Conn.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Prelinger was an associate editor of Yale's Papers of Benjamin Franklin project, which she joined in 1970. She also was a member of the advisory committee on women's programs at the Harvard Divinity School.         Long a prominent figure in the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians, Mrs. Prelinger served as its president from 1975 to 1977 and last year was a member of its nominating committee.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Prelinger was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Vassar College who earned her Ph.D. in history at Yale University in 1954.         She also contributed to scholarly journals both in this country and in Germany and had just completed the editing of a book, "Episcopal Woman," to be published next year by the Oxford University Press in New York.         Mrs. Prelinger is survived by her husband, Dr. Ernst Prelinger, a Yale University psychologist; two daughters, Dr. Katherine Holden of Sharon, Conn., and Edith Holden Roth of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; a stepson, Richard Prelinger of New York City; three stepdaughters, Elizabeth A. Prelinger of Washington, Polly Prelinger of San Francisco, and Jane Rothkopf of New York City; and six grandchildren.       
         Nancy Proskauer Dryfoos, a sculptor in stone and terra cotta whose work is in the permanent collections of many museums and universities, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness with lung cancer, said her husband, Donald.         Mrs. Dryfoos had more than a dozen one-woman shows in New York, Connecticut and Washington, and her work has been exhibited in group exhibitions at institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Dallas Museum of Fine Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.         Her work is in the permanent collections of Columbia University, Brandeis University, New York University, the Boca Raton Museum in Florida, Kean College in New Jersey, and other institutions.         Nancy Edith Proskauer was born on March 25, 1918, in New Rochelle, N.Y. She graduated from Drew Seminary and Sarah Lawrence College. She and Mr. Dryfoos were married in 1938.         Mrs. Dryfoos studied at the Columbia University School of Architecture with Oronzio Maldarelli, and privately with Jose de Creeft, as well as at the Art Students League in Manhattan.         She was a winner of many awards, including the Gold Medal of Honor from the Allied Artists of America, the Edel Award for Fine Arts, and the Naomi Lehman Memorial Award.         Mrs. Dryfoos served as a member, officer and board member on many artistic and charitable organizations. She was a fellow and former officer of the National Sculpture Society; a member of, and contest juror for, the Allied Artists of America, and director of the American Society of Contemporary Artists from 1970 to 1972, among many other professional affiliations. She was also on the Creative Arts Award Commission of Brandeis University.         She is survived only by her husband.       
         Ann C. Whitman, an influential figure in the White House as the personal secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Tuesday at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Clearwater.         Mrs. Whitman died of heart failure, friends said.         "There's no question she played a vital role in the Eisenhower Administration; he really depended on her tremendously," said Robert J. Donovan, author of "Confidential Secretary: Ann Whitman's 20 Years with Eisenhower and Rockefeller" (E. P. Dutton, 1988).         Mrs. Whitman routinely worked 12 hours a day, and often seven days a week. Among her chores was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, which reached hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Recruited in 1952         Mrs. Whitman, whose maiden name was Cook, was born in Perry, Ohio, and attended Antioch College. As part of its work-study program, she went to the Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, became a secretary there and never returned to college. Her next job, which she held for 16 years, was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father was a founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company.         In the early 1950's Mrs. Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe. She was then recruited for the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952, and worked for Eisenhower through both of his Administrations.         In 1961 she worked for George Hinman, a political adviser to Rockefeller when he was Governor of New York, and became the Governor's executive assistant in 1965. In 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford named Rockefeller as Vice President, she served as his chief of staff. She retired in 1977.         Mrs. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1940 she married Edmund Whitman, her first husband's business colleague at the United Fruit Company. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1961.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Mary S. Painter Garin, an American economist who was an important innovator in the use of statistical techniques during and immediately after World War II, died Monday in Toulon, France, near her home in Sollies-Toucas. She was 71 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said a niece, Sarah Wells.         Miss Painter, as she was known professionally, was one of a small group of economists who made national-income analysis a powerful tool for government and military policy-making from World War II on. She served in the Marshall Plan and at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,         A native of Minneapolis, Miss Painter graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942 with high honors and went directly to the Board of Economic Warfare and then to the Office of Strategic Services. There she pioneered the development of original techniques for analyzing Nazi Germany's military abilities. She devised a statistical model for estimating the size of the German submarine fleet in the North Atlantic, which after the war, was found to have been startlingly accurate. Calculated Past G.N.P.         After the war, she served at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Her article "Estimates of Gross National Product, 1919 Through 1928," published in the Federal Reserve bulletin in September 1945, used new Commerce Department concepts to calculate the gross national product for the 10 years after World War I.         In 1948, Miss Painter went to Paris in the first wave of economists who set up the European headquarters of the Marshall Plan. She was in charge of analyzing the French and German economies at the United States Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other regional organizations until 1960. She returned to the United States for two years, working on problems of arms control and disarmament with Prof. Emile Benoit at Columbia University.         In 1962, she returned to Paris to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the successor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, originally established to administer Marshall Plan aid to Europe.         Miss Painter was also known as a remarkable cook. In 1969, she married Georges Garin, one of the outstanding chefs of France, who was the proprietor of Chez Garin, a restaurant on the Left Bank.  Work in Restaurants         When Miss Painter retired as an economist from O.E.C.D., she became, in the best French tradition of restaurateur's wives, la Patronne of Chez Garin, presiding over its cash register.         The Garins closed the restaurant in 1973 and established a new one, Le Lingousto, at Sollies-Toucas. Mr. Garin died in 1979, and Miss Painter lived there the rest of her life.         She was a close friend and early supporter of the author James Baldwin, and his book "Another Country" is dedicated to her.         She is survived by her sister, Charlotte Morse of Minneapolis, five nieces and three nephews.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Elizabeth M. Cahill, wife of William T. Cahill, a former Governor of New Jersey, died on Wednesday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after a brief illness. She was 79 years old and lived in Haddonfield, N.J.         Mr. Cahill, a Republican who had served in the House of Representatives, was Governor for four years, starting in January 1970.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Cahill is survived by five daughters, Kathleen Tully of Haddonfield, Mary E. Cahill of Washington, Regina Blake Keeley of Potomac, Md., Teresa Cahill of Boston and Eileen Campbell of Merchantville, N.J.; two sons, William T. Jr. and John P., both of Collingswood, N.J.; a brother, George Myrtetus of Scotch Plains, N.J., and 13 grandchildren.       
         Leah Silberzan Sayles, a leader in the movement to legalize abortion in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan.         She was 61 years old and died of a brain tumor, her family said.         Ms. Sayles joined the board of directors of the Abortion Justice Association in 1969, was a founding member of the National Abortion Federation and was active in the National Abortion Rights Action League.         Soon after earning a master's degree in social work from the University of Pittsburgh in 1968, she became the counseling director for Planned Parenthood in Western Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh. In 1973 she established Women's Health Services in Pittsburgh and served as its executive director for 11 years. The agency at one time described itself as the nation's largest nonprofit abortion clinic.         She is survived by her husband, Donald; two sons, David, of Manhattan and Adam, of Kenova, W. Va., and a sister, Frances Edlitz of Rockville, Md.       
         Allegra Maynard, a retired headmistress of the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., died Wednesday at the North Hill Retirement Center in Needham, Mass., where she resided. She was 94 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a spokeswoman for the school said.         Miss Maynard joined the staff at Madeira, a college preparatory school for girls, in 1931, the year the school moved from Washington to its present site on the Potomac River. After serving as associate headmistress, Miss Maynard became co-headmistress with Lucy Madeira Wing, who founded the school in 1906, succeeding her as headmistress in 1957.         Retiring at age 65 in 1962, Miss Maynard settled in Dedham, Mass., and went back to school, auditing classes at Wellesley College. She came out of retirement in 1964 to serve another year as headmistress at Madeira.         In June 1985, the school honored Miss Maynard with the dedication of a new faculty housing complex, called the Allegra Maynard Quadrangle.         Born in East Weymouth, Mass., she grew up in California and attended the University of California at Berkeley. She graduated in 1919 from Wheaton College, which awarded her an honorary master's degree in 1953, calling her a "wise counselor and able administrator."         While at Madeira, Miss Maynard served six years on the executive committee of the National Council of Independent Schools and was its chairwoman for three years. She was also a member at large of the College Entrance Examination Board, and held the posts of secretary and president of the Head Mistresses Association of the East.         She served 10 years as treasurer of the Fairfax, Va., chapter of the American Red Cross.         She is survived by a niece, Barbara B. Howe of Marion, Mass.       
         Mary McDonough Phillips, an editor who helped train a generation of fashion journalists, died last Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long illness. She was 77 years old and lived in New York City and Jupiter, Fla.         She had suffered from a blood disorder for more than 20 years, said her husband, Lynn Phillips.         Soon after graduating from Rosemount College in Rosemount, Pa., in 1935, she joined the Hearst Corporation, starting at Good Housekeeping magazine. She then moved to Harper's Bazaar, becoming executive editor in 1952. Carmel Snow, Nancy White and Dianna Vreeland were among her associates during the 1950's and 1960's.         In 1971 she was named director of marketing of Harper's Bazaar, and in 1980 became retail marketing manager of Town & Country. Though she retired in 1984, she continued as consultant to Town & Country until the end.         Through much of her career, she served as liaison between editorial and advertising deparments and helped shape the direction of the magazines for which she worked. Her friends included major fashion figures such as the designers Ben Zuckerman, Archie Davidow and Norman Norell.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Michael, of St. Louis, four grandchildren and a brother, Edward, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.       
         Lydia Ulana Savoyka, a Ukrainian-born social worker, who served 35 years as director of immigration counseling services for the United States Catholic Conference, died on Dec. 20 at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after collapsing in her office, her sister, Vera Savoyka, said.         Ms. Savoyka, whose father was arrested and killed by Russian forces in Cracow, Poland, came to the United States in 1948, under a program for orphans, sponsored by the National Catholic Welfare Conference. As soon as she graduated from high school, Ms. Savoyka began working with immigrants on Ellis Island under the auspices of the Welfare Conference, now known as the U.S. Catholic Conference.         Fluent in 11 languages, she proved invaluable in dealing with the wave of post-World War II immigrants from Eastern Europe and the later influx of refugees from Central America. While carrying a heavy work load, she earned a degree in sociology by going to night school at Hunter College. 'Extraordinary Devotion'         Besides her counseling activities, Ms. Savoyka was president of the New York General Committee for Immigration, grouping 30 private agencies, and was a member of the National Advisory Council on Immigration and Naturalization. She was also vice president of the Ukrainian Institute of America and president of the Self-Reliance Senior Citizens Club.         In conferring on her an honorary doctorate in law in 1982, the College of New Rochelle cited her "life of extraordinary devotion to America's newest arrivals." In the last few years she had personally helped hundreds of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear diaster of April 1986, arranging medical and immigration services.         She is survived by her sister.       
         Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.         Mrs. Kriendler was born in New York City and was a graduate of New York University. During World War II she served in a number of executive positions with the Brooklyn chapter of the Motor Transport Service of the American Women's Voluntary Services, the organization that aided the armed forces and local military bases.         She married Mr. Kriendler in 1933, three years after his brother, Jack, founded "21" Club on West 52d Street. Mr. Kriendler was chairman from 1938 to 1989, when he became honorary chairman.         Mrs. Kriendler was a longtime contributor to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera and helped raise funds for them. She also contributed to Cornell University Veterinary School in Ithaca, N.Y.         Besides her husband, there are no immediate survivors.       
         Harriet Feldman, a former school board president in Roslyn, L.I., died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 56 years old and lived in Roslyn.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Feldman taught schools in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and in Massapequa Park, L.I. She was president of the Parent-Teacher Association at six Roslyn schools.         For the last six years, she was an elected member of the Board of Education. She served as vice president and later president.         She is survived by her husband, Herbert; two sons, David, of Bayside, Queens, and Peter, of Roslyn; two daughters, Karen and Jennifer, of Roslyn; her mother, Miriam Glickman of West Lawrence, L.I.; a sister, Theda Wells of Woodmere, L.I., and two granddaughters.       
         Berenice Abbott, a pioneer of modern American photography, died yesterday at her home in Monson, Me. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Hank O'Neal, her biographer.         Miss Abbott is best known for her powerful black-and-white photographs of New York City in the 1930's. In these pictures, she used the tools of modernist photographic style -- including dynamically framed compositions, flattened pictorial space, high angles, and great detail -- to capture the enormous energy and variety of the city.         Perhaps her most famous picture, a view of New York at night taken from the top of the Empire State Building, presents the city as a glittering tapestry of light, with massive buildings thrusting up from the criss-crossed streets. In her New York photographs, many of which were collected in the book "Changing New York" (1939), Miss Abbott also provided an invaluable historical record of the physical appearance of the city at a time when it was undergoing rapid transformation.         Miss Abbott first achieved fame as a photographer in Paris in the 1920's with her penetrating portraits of such artists and writers as James Joyce, Janet Flanner and Jean Cocteau. She is also known for a series of photographs illustrating laws and processes of physics. Documentary Advocate         As a participant in the photographic controversies of her day, Miss Abbott was an eloquent and contentious advocate of the documentary approach. In books and articles she argued that photography was uniquely a descriptive medium, and should not be used to simulate effects that could better be achieved in other arts. "Photography can never grow up if it imitates some other medium," she wrote in 1951. "It has to walk alone; it has to be itself."         Miss Abbott was also known as the person primarily responsible for the present-day fame of the French photographer Eugene Atget, whom she met in Paris two years before his death in 1927. For almost four decades Atget had earned a modest living photographing the artistic monuments of Paris and its environs, selling prints to artists, publishers and archivists. In the course of this work he had built up a large file of photographs documenting Parisian life and culture.         Upon his death Miss Abbott bought the almost 1,500 glass-plate negatives and some 8,000 prints remaining in his studio. When she returned to New York in 1929, she brought the materials with her, and in following years arranged exhibitions, print sales and the publication of several books of Atget's work.  The collection remained in Miss Abbott's possession until 1968, when it was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art; it later became the basis for a series of four exhibitions and books that was completed in 1984. Assistant to Man Ray         Atget's photographs, which combine straightforward description with great formal beauty, have exerted a great influence on the development of American photography. Most notably they served as a model for the work of Walker Evans, who first saw them in New York shortly after Miss Abbott's return from Paris. In the years since, Atget has provided an important example of purpose and style to a host of other photographers.         Born in Springfield, Ohio, on July 17, 1898, Berenice Abbott studied briefly at Ohio State University before going first to New York and then, in 1921, to Europe to study sculpture and drawing. She went into photography by accident, going to work in Paris in 1923 as a darkroom assistant for the American Surrealist Man Ray. In 1925 she took up portrait photography as a means of earning a living, but quickly discovered her love and aptitude for the work. In 1926 she opened her own studio, and soon built up a successful career as a portrait photographer.         On a short visit to the United States in 1929 she was excited by the speed and energy of New York, and decided to undertake a project to record the changing face of the city. She moved back to the United States and began to photograph, working first with a small, hand-held camera. By 1932, though, she had switched to a large-format camera that produced 8-by-10-inch negatives capable of recording great detail. 'Changing New York'         For several years she financed the project herself. In 1935, though, she was able to obtain support from the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration and began to produce the pictures that were published four years later as "Changing New York." She focused on architectural details and important historical buildings, as well as bridges and skyscrapers, often aiming her camera up or down to achieve dizzying perspectives. Occasionally she included people in the pictures, but her primary emphasis was on the physical structure of the city. Her pictures of row houses and tenements, elevated trains and automats, warehouses and store fronts, provide a remarkably thorough record of the city in all its diversity.         After completing her documentation of New York, Miss Abbott turned to scientific photography and invention, and in 1958 she joined the physical science study committee of Education Services Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., to take photographs for a new high-school physics text. Many of her pictures from this time have a remarkable geometric beauty while at the same time providing clear illustrations of such physical phenomena as the interference patterns produced by two sets of waves or the refraction of a beam of light through a prism.         Her scientific photographs won her new acclaim both before and after the textbook "Health" was published in 1960. In the opinion of her principal biographer, Mr. O'Neal, her scientific work "may well be viewed in future years as her outstanding contribution to photography." A Major Retrospective         During her years in New York, Miss Abbott was an active freelance photographer. She established the photography program at the New School for Social Research, and published several other books. In 1966 she moved to Maine, where she lived until her death, although she retained a connection to the city through a continuing association with the New York Public Library, which sponsored a major retrospective exhibition of her work in 1989.         The New York exhibition, organized by Julia van Haaften, later traveled to Dallas, Atlanta, Toledo, Ohio, and Tokyo. Over the years Miss Abbott's work was the subject of many other exhibitions at major museums, including the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology in Washington (1969) and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1970). In 1982 her life and work were summed up in a book, "Berenice Abbott: American Photographer," by Mr. O'Neal.         There are no survivors. A spokesman for the New York Public Library said a memorial service would be held in the library's Celeste Bartos Forum at a date to be announced.         Correction:  December 20, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Dec. 11 about the photographer Berenice Abbott misstated the title of the 1960 textbook in which photographs by Miss Abbott appeared. It was "Physics."       
         Margaret Eyring Moreland, a psychologist who practiced in New York for many years, died on Friday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 76 years old and lived in Yarmouth Port, Mass.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Moreland, a native of New York City, graduated from City College and Fordham University, where she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology. She began her career in 1940 at the New York Domestic Relations Court. In World War II she served as an Army psychologist and then worked at several institutions in New York, Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y. She retired as an educational psychologist at City College in 1980.         At her death she was a board member at Access House, a safe haven for abused teen-aged girls in Falmouth. A summer resident of Cape Cod since 1969, she moved there permanently two years ago.         She is survived by son, Don, of Harwich, Mass., and a brother, Edward J. Eyring of Langhorne, Pa.
