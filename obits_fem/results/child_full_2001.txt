         Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose stewardship of the Brearley School and then Barnard College made her a national role model for generations of young women who wanted to combine career and family, died on Wednesday at her home in Tyringham, Mass. She was 102.         An outspoken feminist in the 1940's and 50's before feminism became popular, Mrs. McIntosh was the first married woman to head one of the seven top women's colleges known as the Seven Sisters and became a national icon.         ''She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president, said at a gathering in 1998 at the McIntosh Student Center to mark Mrs. McIntosh's centennial birthday. She said Mrs. McIntosh, a campus legend, was a pioneer in exploring ''the struggle of both women and men to find their true roles in a changing world.''         Leora Hanser, Barnard student government president at the time of the celebration, said Mrs. McIntosh ''came from a different era, but the work and family issue is really very important, and a lot of Barnard students struggle with this today.''         In her long career, Mrs. McIntosh spoke and lectured widely, spreading ideas about women, education and child-rearing that would become popular 20 or 30 years later.         ''Having both a job and a family broadens one's perspective, which in turn makes a great contribution to a happy home life,'' she told the American Association of University Women in 1950.         She called for child care to be elevated to a dignified profession so working mothers could leave children in capable hands. And she attacked the conditioning that led young girls to feel they must subordinate their own interests when they were with boys, or to use the ''foolish technique'' of pretending they were stupid to be popular.         For anyone doubting that it could be done, Mrs. McIntosh was also the ultimate role model as she juggled marriage, five children (including twins) and her own career. Newsweek magazine viewed that as so remarkable that it put her on its cover in 1951.         But Mrs. McIntosh was less didactic than some later feminists. Even as she urged young women to participate in politics and community service and careers, she warned them that combining career and family meant pushing out nearly everything else. And she portrayed family life as a cornerstone of society and democracy, adding that in the face of conflict, family must take precedence.         ''You must be prepared to sacrifice many of your social contacts until your family is full grown,'' she said, ''and must always remember that your home comes before all else.''         She also respected the idea that happiness could come in many ways. Personal fulfillment ''may or may not lie in a career,'' she told The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. ''What is important is for each individual to order her life so that she becomes a happy, creative person.''         Her approach to life was rooted in common sense and a lack of pretense, physically and intellectually. A small, trim woman, she often wore plain suits without decoration. As a college president, she swept her own vestibule and weeded her own garden. And when she was honored after 10 years as chief of Barnard, she agreed on the condition that there be no speeches, no gifts and no flowers.         She also disliked honorifics. She preferred ''Mrs.'' to Dean and was often referred to as ''Mrs. Mac.'' When Barnard officials referred to her in news releases as ''Dr.,'' she chided them, saying, ''There is only one doctor in our family,'' referring to her husband, Dr. Rustin McIntosh, a pediatrician who taught at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.         Mrs. McIntosh saw education in its broadest sense, from conjugating irregular Greek verbs to sex education, as the way to prepare young women for the complicated balancing act she was urging on them. She believed that the education of young women for motherhood was society's ''most important task.''         At a time when few women were represented in the boardrooms of major American corporations, Mrs. McIntosh was a director of several companies, schools, foundations and civic groups.         After her retirement in 1962, she and her husband moved to their farm in Tyringham, Mass. Her husband died in 1986. Mrs. McIntosh is survived by a daughter, Susan Lloyd of Tinmouth, Vt.; 4 sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich., R. Carey, of Tyringham, Kenneth of West Newton, Mass., and J. Richard, of Boulder, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.         Millicent Carey McIntosh was born on Nov. 30, 1898, in Baltimore, the daughter of Anthony Morris Carey, who ran a machinery supply business, and the former Margaret Cheston Thomas, both active Quakers. She had five brothers and sisters, and all were taught to mend and darn and market and cook.         Her feminist notions were shaped by strong role models in her family. Her mother fought for women's suffrage, racial equality and prison reform. Her aunt, M. Carey Thomas, was a pioneer in women's education, a founder of the Bryn Mawr School (a girls' school in Baltimore) and president of Bryn Mawr College.         At Bryn Mawr, young Millicent played water polo and basketball and majored in Greek and English, graduating magna cum laude. She organized clubs for factory workers before accepting her aunt's offer of a year of study abroad.         After studying economics at Cambridge and English at Johns Hopkins University (where she did her doctoral thesis on 14th-century English mystery dramas), Mrs. McIntosh became an instructor at Bryn Mawr College. But she quickly was appointed dean of freshmen and then acting dean of the college.         She left Bryn Mawr to became headmistress at the Brearley School, the private girls school in Manhattan, from 1930 to 1947, and converted it from a half-day format to a full day. When she arrived, she asked her students to help plan the ''ideal school'' with the fewest possible rules. She worked without a desk because she felt that a desk intimated students. She introduced aptitude tests and remedial instruction and instituted a sex education course for sixth graders, which she taught.         In 1932, after she married Dr. McIntosh, her aunt discouraged her retirement, telling her, ''You can have your babies in August.'' At Brearley, she had five children. (She took to wearing academic robes to cover pregnancies.)         She was a hands-on manager, both at school and at home. She left detailed instructions for her household: menus, shopping lists, activities for the children. And every morning, she called Brearley to specify a hymn for morning assembly.         In late 1946, before Barnard had its own president (she was given the title in 1952), Mrs. McIntosh was chosen from more than 60 candidates to succeed Virginia Gildersleeve as Barnard's dean. It was a life that left few free minutes, but Mrs. McIntosh grabbed every one. She signed correspondence during intermissions at concerts and took her secretary with her to the beauty parlor so she could give dictation.         An administrator who valued good teaching, Mrs. McIntosh was dismayed that teachers were paid less than secretaries and dedicated some of Barnard's endowment for faculty salaries.         She also valued merit, and directed another part of the Barnard endowment to scholarships to open Barnard's doors to ''still more girls of superior talent regardless of their ability to pay.''         As she balanced career and home, Mrs. McIntosh acknowledged both her husband's support and good household help (which at one point included a governess, a cook and two daily helpers). She also respected the individuality of her children, keeping each in a separate school until one year, after attending five separate Christmas pageants, she said, ''I thought if I heard one more 'Silent Night' I would break down.'' Their schooling was consolidated.         At Barnard, she continued to teach: English and modern living, a required class that sought to help students think through their lives. She also presided over a $10 million fund-raising campaign.         John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rarely contributed to development funds, agreed to give Barnard $1 million, he told Mrs. McIntosh, ''because of my confidence in the exceptional vision and leadership you are bringing to the college.''         Even after she retired from Barnard, the trustees continued to consult her. In 1971, when men's and women's colleges everywhere were going coeducational and Barnard was facing pressure to merge into Columbia, Barnard's chairwoman, Eleanor Elliott, turned to Mrs. McIntosh, who suggested that the trustees try to answer three questions: Would a merger produce better education for Barnard and Columbia? Would relations between Barnard women and Columbia men be improved? And would a merger create economies for both colleges?         ''Mrs. Mac's questions helped organize our thinking simply and calmly,'' Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, ''and of course, we felt stronger.''       
         Candida Donadio, the celebrated literary agent who sold Joseph Heller's first novel, ''Catch-22,'' and Philip Roth's ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' died on Saturday at her home in Stonington, Conn. She was 71.         According to Neil Olson, her partner in Donadio & Olson, the cause was cancer. Ms. Donadio had not been active as an agent since 1995 because of her illness.         Among her clients were Thomas Pynchon, William Gaddis, Robert Stone, Michael Herr, Bruce Jay Friedman and Mario Puzo.         ''She really was the agent of her generation,'' Mr. Olson said. ''Her special talent was identifying new and unique writers. It is hard for us to realize now when you look at what a Pynchon and what a Heller was doing. She was looking at these writers in the late 50's and early 60's. People were not writing that way.''         Harriet Wasserman of the Harriet Wasserman Literary Agency, who worked with and was a friend of Ms. Donadio for many years, said of her talent with regard to writers: ''She was an appreciator. She recognized and appreciated what their gift was.''         Ms. Donadio was in her first job as a literary agent in 1957 when she sold the Joseph Heller novel that was then titled ''Catch 18.''         The contract with Simon & Schuster called for Heller to receive $750 on signing and $750 on publication.         Because Leon Uris's ''Mila 18'' posed the possibility of confusion, a title change for the Heller book was in order.         Ms. Donadio said the number 22 was chosen as a substitute because Oct. 22 was her birthday.         Ms. Wasserman was working with her at the time, as a secretary, at Herb Jaffe Associates.         ''Since a secretary was very important, I got paid $90 a week, and Candida, since she was only an agent, got only $75 a week,'' Ms. Wasserman said.         Ms. Donadio, a child of Italian immigrants, was born in 1929 in Brooklyn and moved to Manhattan in the early 1950's when she began her career as a secretary at the McIntosh & McKee agency.         In 1957, when Mr. Jaffe, who represented playwrights, screenwriters and actors, decided to expand in the literary realm, he hired Ms. Donadio, who was still a secretary but had a reputation for working extremely hard and working directly with some of the clients at McIntosh & McKee. And so she became an agent.         When Mr. Jaffe sold the agency in 1961, Ms. Donadio found a new home at Russell & Volkening.         In 1968, she joined forces with Robert Lantz, and in the 1970's she formed her own firm.         Later she became partners with Eric Ashworth and then with Mr. Olson.         Ms. Donadio's two marriages, to the critic H. .E. F. Donahue and to Henry Bloomstein, a writer, ended in divorce. She is survived by a brother, Louis Donadio of Tehachapi, Calif., and a sister, Frances Siliani of Florence, Italy.         ''She loved reading,'' Ms. Wasserman said. ''She loved writers.''       
         Kate Born Schaeffer, a longtime partner with her husband at Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan, which became known for selling art by old masters to museums and collectors, died on Dec. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 102.         For three decades Mrs. Schaeffer and her husband, Dr. Hanns Schaeffer, ran the New York Schaeffer Galleries, which was founded in 1936 and has been at 983 Park Avenue in Manhattan for more than 50 years. They also contributed some artworks to museums.         Dr. Schaeffer died in the early 1960's and Mrs. Schaeffer became the owner and president of Schaeffer Galleries until her death. Schaeffer Galleries is now owned and directed by the Schaeffers' daughter, Cornelia Bessie, who had been its vice president.         James J. Rorimer, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1955 to 1967, observed in 1961: ''The Schaeffers are among the most serious, knowledgeable and helpful art dealers who are enabling American museums to grow for the benefit of our public. They are friends who share unstintingly in helping curators, directors and trustees to choose with care the works of art which redound to the credit of their museums.''         The paintings and drawings that passed through the Schaeffers' hands included, among many others, Botticelli's ''Madonna and Child with Singing Angels,'' now held by the Staatliche Museen in Berlin; a Cranach in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo.; Correggio's ''Salvator Mundi'' in the National Gallery of Art in Washington; Rubens's ''Cleopatra'' at the Detroit Institute of Arts; a Frans Hals at the Mauritshuis in The Hague; numerous Rembrandts, including ''Young Man With a Sword'' in the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh; and da Vinci's ''Bear Walking'' and a Jean-Antoine Watteau, both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Gilbert S. Edelson, the administrative vice president of the Art Dealers Association of America, which is based in Manhattan, said the Schaeffers ''were knowledgeable, they were articulate, they had all the qualities that make truly distinguished dealers.''         Mrs. Schaeffer, whose maiden name was Born, was born in Germany and studied singing in various European capitals. She was a lieder and opera singer in Germany for a few years before she married Dr. Schaeffer, who was also born in Germany, not long after World War I ended. Later, gallery work became her main activity.         Her husband opened an art gallery in 1921 in Berlin and later operated galleries in London and San Francisco. Those galleries were also each named Schaeffer Galleries. All had closed before Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan was founded, after the Schaeffers had moved to the United States permanently.         Mrs. Schaeffer is survived by her daughter, Cornelia Bessie of Lyme, Conn.       
         Arlene Eisenberg, who with her two daughters wrote ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' which became known as the pregnancy bible, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         From girlhood, when she repeatedly read Dr. Benjamin Spock's ''Baby and Child Care'' to qualify for a Girl Scout child care merit badge, to grandmotherhood, when she led the weekly new mothers' group at Ansche Chesed Temple on the Upper West Side, she seemed the perfect mother, but her mission was to tell mothers that they did not have to be perfect.         ''She was my mother, but I lent her out a lot,'' said her daughter Heidi E. Murkoff. ''She was sort of foster mother to the world.''         ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' the team's first book in a best-selling series on what to expect from pregnancy, babies and toddlers, was released by the Workman Publishing Company in 1984. Sales were modest at first, but it inexorably climbed to the best-seller list six years later. Without extensive advertising, demand grew by what the authors called ''word of mother,'' with sales now totaling 9.6 million copies in 31 languages.         ''It was quietly marvelous, sort of like Mozart,'' said Peter Workman,  the publishing house president, of the book's success.         In 1999, Good Housekeeping magazine reported that a survey showed that 93 percent of expectant or nursing mothers who had read any book about pregnancy had read it.         Now as common as bibs at baby showers, the book provided common-sense answers to the questions of mothers-to-be. Topics range from diet to delivery to postpartum depression and are arranged by month of pregnancy.         The authors used a question-and-answer format to deal with things people might be shy about asking their doctor, like whether the fetus is aware that the parents are having sex. (No.)         Mrs. Eisenberg said the book responded to a fragmented society in which people often live far from relatives who could reassure them about pregnancy.         ''It used to be you could get all the good information about raising your kids from your mother,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1999. ''But it's all changed. Most young women have never held, never even see, a newborn baby. It's really a shock.''         The first ''what to expect'' book emerged from the 1984 pregnancy of Mrs. Murkoff, Mrs. Eisenberg's younger daughter and a writer who was dismayed that she could find few books about pregnancy that were not excessively didactic and authoritarian -- not to mention full of incomprehensible medical terms. The mother and daughter and another daughter, Sandee E. Hathaway, a nurse, teamed up to fill the void.         They delivered their book proposal to the publisher hours before Mrs. Murkoff gave birth to a daughter, Emma. They delivered the book the day Mrs. Hathaway felt the first kick from the fetus that was to be her daughter Rachel.         The success of the first book led the three to answer readers' pleas for help after birth. In 1989, they published ''What to Expect the First Year,'' and in 1994, ''What to Expect the Toddler Years.'' They also published ''What to Eat When You're Expecting,'' in 1986, and ''The Pregnancy Organizer,'' in 1996. All were published by Workman.         Arlene Leila Scharaga was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on June 8, 1934. Her father, Harry Scharaga, headed the Sanitation Department in Queens.         When Arlene was 16, her mother took her to an Eddie Fisher concert at the Paramount Theater. Afterward, they met Mr. Fisher and his young press agent, Howard Eisenberg. Before long, she volunteered to help organize fan clubs for the singer, personally visiting his barber to retrieve locks of the star's hair to send to bobbysoxers around the country.         When there wasn't enough of Mr. Fisher's hair to go around, she would send locks of Mr. Eisenberg's, Mr. Eisenberg said. He began to suspect she was most interested in being around him.         A couple of years later, she said, ''I'm going to be 18 and I don't want to waste any time.''         Mr. Eisenberg asked her to marry him. ''She ran after me until I caught her,'' he said.         She dropped out of Queens College for marriage, but her ambitions and abilities transcended babies. Mr. Eisenberg recounted how he had writer's block on a freelance article for a Sunday supplement that appeared in many newspapers. The day before it was due, Mrs. Eisenberg sat at the typewriter and wrote the entire piece, which with a few revisions, was accepted.         The two wrote articles together for many popular magazines, including The Ladies' Home Journal, McCall's and Sports Illustrated. In 1965, they won the Gold Medal of the National Conference of Christians and Jews for a Look magazine piece, ''The Christian War Against Anti-Semitism.''         The family lived in Garden City on Long Island and in Spring Valley in Rockland County, N.Y., before moving to Manhattan 19 years ago.         When the daughters became adults, the women often collaborated long distance, with various drafts and rewrites conveyed by fax or computer.         Mrs. Eisenberg did not need a guidebook to be a different kind of mother. At a time when breast-feeding was out of favor, she did it with her daughters and a son, Evan. She also insisted on wheat germ and dark bread, prompting her children to envy schoolmates eating white bread in the lunchroom.         In addition to her husband and her son (also a writer), both of Manhattan; Mrs. Hathaway, of Newton, Mass.; and Mrs. Murkoff, of Santa Barbara, Calif., Mrs. Eisenberg is survived by her mother, Mildred Scharaga of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Victor Scharaga of Washington; and six grandchildren.         Another of Mrs. Eisenberg's legacies is the What to Expect Foundation, which she and Mrs. Murkoff founded after visiting pregnant inmates at Rikers Island, the New York City jail. The foundation is printing a basic pregnancy book written at a lower literacy level for disadvantaged women.         Mrs. Murkoff says she will probably carry on with the next chapter, entirely predictable, in the family's series: ''What to Expect in the Teen Years.'' Emma, whose imminent birth inspired the first book, is 17.       
         Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107.         Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare.         The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers' safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory.         The union's successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago.         Mrs. Freedman's life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband's death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79.         Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. ''I'd look matronly,'' she said.         Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused.         The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same.         The alternative was jumping.         ''Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,'' she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, ''The Living Century,'' shown in December and January.         As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. ''When I came in the street, here comes my father,'' she recalled. ''He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn't go back to work anymore. I went to college.''         The anger about what she saw as the owners' greed persisted. In the documentary, she said:         ''That's the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It's not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything.         ''That's the biggest mistake -- that a person doesn't count much when he hasn't got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn't got a heart? I don't pretend. I feel it. Still.''         Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania.         With Mrs. Freedman's father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman's housecleaning abilities. ''You call this work?'' she demanded.         Mrs. Freedman's response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good -- she eventually spoke seven languages -- she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire.         She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where.         When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman's grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search.         After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York.         They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, ''Five years.'' She replied, ''I have time.''         Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64.         ''Of course it was a lie, but they didn't know it was a lie,'' she said. She worked until she was 79.         In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100.         She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself.         Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107.         ''To me, 106 is a number,'' she said in the documentary. ''I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You've got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?''         Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter's birth, and always advised the child's mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died.         ''Sadness takes years from you,'' she said.         Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying.         ''This is the last voice of an event,'' he said. ''This woman actually smelled the smoke.''       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Dale Evans, who won the hearts of millions of Americans as she rode alongside her husband, Roy Rogers, in western films and on ''The Roy Rogers Show'' in the early years of television, died yesterday at her home in Apple Valley, Calif., east of Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Evans had not been on a horse since childhood and her hopes for a Hollywood career were sputtering when she was cast opposite John Wayne in her first Western, ''In Old Oklahoma,'' in 1944. She went on to become an accomplished sound-stage equestrienne, playing opposite rugged, handsome and likable cowboys in dozens of Westerns before she met and married Rogers, the King of the Cowboys, and composed the couple's enduring theme song, ''Happy Trails to You.''         By the 1950's she was a fixture on the sagebrush-epic landscape of snarling men, delicate ladies and roaring oil gushers. And with the dawn of television, she became a fixture in the minds of millions of children who tuned in to ''The Roy Rogers Show'' and saw her moseying  along on her buckskin horse, Buttermilk, while Rogers rode his beloved golden palomino, Trigger, the Smartest Horse in the Movies.         Miss Evans's break had come years earlier, while she was working as a $12-a-week stenographer in Dallas. While she was transcribing a letter, her boss suggested that she appear on a radio program that the company was sponsoring . She did, and soon was singing on regional radio hookups. By 1940 she was the featured performer on a CBS radio network program, ''News and Rhythm,'' and was heard on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy program.         She was also appearing at the Gay Paree supper club in Chicago, where her showstopper was ''Will You Marry Me, Mr. Larramie?''         One night an agent offered not marriage but a screen test, opposite Bing Crosby in ''Holiday Inn.'' She did not get the part in the film, which also starred Fred Astaire and featured such Irving Berlin hits as ''White Christmas.'' But 20th Century-Fox signed her to a one-year contract.         She moved to Republic in 1943 and was cast opposite Wayne in ''In Old Oklahoma'' (it was later retitled ''The War of the Wildcats''), a romance about a swaggering, no-nonsense oil driller. The following year, she was cast in ''The Cowboy and the Señorita.''         The cowboy was Roy Rogers, a rugged, handsome and likable man but, by his own account, ''no great shakes'' as a talker.         Miss Evans was no señorita -- at the time, she was married to her second husband, Robert Dale Butts, a pianist. They divorced in 1945, and the following year, Rogers's wife died after giving birth to a son, Roy Rogers Jr.         Miss Evans and Rogers made eight films together in 1946, including ''My Pal Trigger.'' She admitted to having trouble with Trigger: she made the mistake of patting his neck.         ''He is a very highly cued horse,'' she said. ''He is cued to rear when you touch that spot on his neck. He stood straight up on his hind legs. I slipped off that dish I was sitting on, and fell flat on my -- I fell off in the dust.''         Her fans complained that Rogers seemed to care more about Trigger than he cared about her. ''How that spurious cowhand can be content to kiss a horse when he has Miss Evans on the lot every day I cannot imagine,'' Robert C. Ruark wrote in The World-Telegram in 1946, ''but the inflexible law of westerns is that the hero shall never smooch the heroine.''         Once, she said, he came close.  ''They were going to let Roy kiss me on the forehead'' in one film -- she said she could not remember which. The idea was to show that he was sorry for pushing her under a bed to keep her from getting hurt in a rough-and-tumble scene. ''But they had a conference and decided against it,'' she said. ''The kids, you know, so I never even got kissed on the forehead. I just get knocked under beds.''         Miss Evans wore outfits of fringes, satins and studs that were every bit as sartorially splendid as those sported by her husband. Thousands and thousands of red-blooded American girls wore Dale Evans outfits and cast-iron six shooters in their matching holster sets as a kind of proto-feminist reach for equality with their brothers.         Dale Evans -- born Frances Octavia Smith on Oct. 31, 1912, in Uvalde, Tex. -- once said that her favorite role was Toni Ames, a newspaperwoman in ''Don't Fence Me In,'' which was released in 1945. ''I like to be active in a role, and hate namby-pamby heroines,'' she said. ''Toni was a pleasant departure from the usual western role, in which the girl just stands around while men do violent and admirable things.''         Miss Evans appeared in the 1950's with the evangelist Billy Graham, and in the 1960's she joined a group of other actors in pressing for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools.         She also began writing inspirational books like ''Angel Unaware'' (Revell, 1953) the story of her daughter Robin, who was born in 1950 with Down syndrome and heart problems and died a few days before her second birthday. ''Angel Unaware'' sold 400,000 copies in two years; Miss Evans gave the profits to the National Association for Retarded Children.         Contrary to common practice at the time, when such children were institutionalized, and contrary to Hollywood myth making, in which fans were not to know that perfect couples sometimes had imperfect children, Miss Evans and Rogers had kept Robin, who was their first child, at home with the family.         It was a large family from the start. Rogers had been a widower with three children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, a son, Roy  Jr., and another daughter, Linda Lou, and Miss Evans had a son, Thomas Frederick Fox Jr., from an earlier marriage that she had entered into when she was 14. To help them overcome their grief over the death of Robin, the couple adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee.         On Aug. 17, 1964, Deborah Lee, then 12 years old, was killed in a church bus-car collision near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David (Sandy) Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after one of their many goodwill visits to an orphanage, choked to death in a military hospital in Germany. An 18-year-old Army private, he had complained of feeling ill after dining at an enlisted men's club. After he died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ''Salute to Sandy.''         They also raised a foster child from Scotland, Marion Fleming, and a Choctaw Indian child, Mary Little Doe, called Dodie.         Roy Rogers died in 1998 at age 86.         Roy Rogers Jr. runs the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum in Victorville, Calif., at the edge of the Mojave Desert and seven miles from the Rogers-Evans ranch, named the Double-R Bar Ranch like the one in their television series.         There, amid all the memorabilia of a time in America when the good guys were polite singing cowboys who wore white hats and fought fairly and never cussed, is a glass case holding a stuffed Trigger, together with Miss Evans's horse Buttermilk and the couple's German shepherd, Bullet.         At the peak of their popularity in the late 1940's and early 50's, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had more than 2,000 fan clubs around the world and hundreds of licensed products from lunchboxes to comic books bore their names and faces.         Their rodeo set a box-office record at Madison Square Garden and they were the only couple to be chosen grand marshals of the annual Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif.         Miss Evans had almost as many credits for songwriting as she did for acting. She wrote or composed more than 25 songs, including ''Aha, San Antone,'' which sold more than 200,000 copies, and ''The Bible Tells Me So.'' She made 30 children's records, . including one that featured her own songs, ''Happy Birthday, Gentle Savior.''         ''I would love to be an evangelist,'' Miss Evans said, ''but I think God has revealed to me that I can serve him best by just remaining at my post.''         Correction:  February 10, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the film and television star Dale Evans on Thursday  misstated the name of the Chicago supper club where she performed in the early 1940's. It was Chez Paree, not Gay Paree.       
         Debra E. Bernhardt, a labor historian who spearheaded a successful three-year drive to obtain landmark status for Union Square Park in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said her sister, Andra Bernhardt Ladd.         The head of the Tamiment Library and the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University, Dr. Bernhardt devoted her career to documenting the lives of the largely unsung men and women who built New York City and, day in and day out, nudged it along: sandhogs and seamstresses, pipe fitters and child welfare workers, secretaries and short-order cooks.         She was the author, with Rachel Bernstein, of ''Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives'' (New York University Press, 2000), a book of photographs and oral histories of working New Yorkers that grew out of an exhibition of the same name at the Museum of the City of New York.         At her death, Dr. Bernhardt was at work on Labor Arts, a Web site devoted to the art and artifacts of working people, scheduled to make its debut in May.         As a public historian, Dr. Bernhardt immersed herself in the kinds of workaday narratives that traditional academic historians, with their eyes trained on the powerful, often overlook. She described her work as ''documenting the undocumented,'' a phrase that neatly encapsulated the particular challenge of public history: how to chronicle the lives of people not in the habit of generating collections of personal papers, boxed and ready for posterity.         But what these people did have was stuff -- leaflets, lapel buttons, picket signs and photographs -- and part of Dr. Bernhardt's job was to persuade them that each of these dusty artifacts was a window on a bygone union election, organizing drive or strike; she would acquire many of them for the Tamiment Library, a research collection devoted to radical movements in the United States from the Civil War onward, as well as for the Wagner Archives, dedicated to labor studies.         ''The dustbin of history is lighter because of her,'' said Miriam Frank, a colleague at N.Y.U.         Debra Ellen Bernhardt was born on May 9, 1953, in Nuremberg, West Germany, where her parents were civilian employees of the United States Army; she was raised in Iron River, Mich., where several members of her Danish-American family worked in the iron mines. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, a master's from Wayne State University and, in 1988, one of the first doctorates from N.Y.U. in public history.         In conjunction with her dissertation, she produced ''New Yorkers at Work,'' an eight-part series broadcast on National Public Radio. In 1995, Dr. Bernhardt received the John Commerford Award, the highest honor of the New York Labor History Association, and, this year, the Distinguished Service Award from the New York City Central Labor Council.         Dr. Bernhardt is survived by her sister, of Lafayette, La.; her parents, Harold and Marcia Bernhardt, of Iron River; and by her husband, Jonathan Bloom, and her children, Alexander and Sonia, all of Brooklyn.         Despite her professional prominence, Dr. Bernhardt remained intensely proud of her own working-class roots. She sang in the New York City Labor Chorus; her business cards bore the logo of the union shop that printed them, as did her son's bar mitzvah invitations. She was known to her friends as Debs -- shorthand not only for Debra, but also for Eugene V.         And it was largely as a result of Dr. Bernhardt's efforts that in September 1998, Union Square Park was declared a national historic landmark by the National Park Service. The square was the cradle of American labor history -- a perennial home to anarchists, Communists, socialists, unionists and assorted rabble-rousing orators, and the site, in 1882, of what was later recognized as the first Labor Day parade.         ''No one realizes that the eight-hour day was won by working people on these streets, in this park,'' Dr. Bernhardt told The New York Times in 1998, as she sat in Union Square, once ringed by union halls and threadbare left-wing publishers and now by upscale restaurants and chain retailers. ''We wanted to celebrate the fact that ordinary people were able to express their rights to free speech and assembly on this spot.''       
         Eleanor Clymer, who in dozens of children's books contrasted country and city life, died yesterday at a retirement community in Haverford, Pa. She was 95.         Between 1943 and 1983, Mrs. Clymer published 58 books, mostly for elementary schoolchildren. Her first, ''A Yard for John,'' which told of a city boy who so longs to play in the mud and grass that his family moves to the suburbs, was praised in The New York Times as a story of reality ''touched with magic.'' In ''The Trolley Car Family'' (1947), a man who loses his job as a street car driver turns his old trolley into a home for his family and moves it to the country.         But Mrs. Clymer also explored the lives of children who stay in the city in books like ''My Brother Stevie'' (1967), about a troubled third grader,  and ''The Tiny Little House'' (1964), inspired by a small house that she saw squeezed between two tall buildings in Manhattan. The story was later adapted into a musical for children, ''The Little House of Cookies.''         Whether set in the city or the country, Mrs. Clymer's stories were grounded in reality, despite a children's book industry enthralled with fantasy. ''No 'Star Wars' and dungeons or dragons and fairy tales,'' she said firmly of her writing in an interview in 1984.         One book, ''Hamburgers -- and Ice Cream for Dessert'' (1975), about a boy searching for food on a desert island, was inspired by her son, Adam, who for a time as a child would eat for dinner only hamburgers, mashed potatoes and peas, and ice cream. Adam Clymer, her only survivor, is now the Washington correspondent of The Times.         Mrs. Clymer originally wanted to be a science writer, and several of her books sought to teach children about subjects like archaeology.         ''She always came up with an interesting idea which no one else had done,'' said Ann Durell, the former publisher of children's books at Dutton, who edited Mrs. Clymer.         Eleanor Lowenton was born in New York City on Jan. 7, 1906, to Russian immigrant parents. She spent most of her life in New York, but in an essay in the ''Something About the Author Autobiography Series'' in 1994, she fondly recalled how she explored the land around her family's tarpaper-covered summer home in New Jersey, and how disappointed she was when her parents had to give up plans to live there permanently because her father could not find a job. The yearning for the country, she said, ''was to influence all our lives.''         After earning a degree in English from the University of Wisconsin in 1928, and marrying Kinsey Clymer, a journalist who became a social worker, she tried to return to country life. She and her family put a down payment on a farm and began repairs, but finances again got in the way, and the Clymers returned to the city.         After taking a workshop at the Bank Street School, Mrs. Clymer decided to try writing for the young.         ''I wanted to tell stories to little children, like my own son and his friends who were beginning to find their way in the everyday world of family, play, work, pets, familiar things that they experienced and understood,'' she recalled.         For the next few decades, she did just that, sometimes so prolifically that she published under pseudonyms so that she would not appear to be competing with herself.         Finally, after their son was grown, the Clymers realized their dream of a country house. In the early 1960's they moved to Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, where Mr. Clymer died in 1984, and Mrs. Clymer lived until 1989.       
         Ida Fisher Davidoff, a family counselor and expert on aging, died on May 11 at a chronic care center in New Canaan, Conn. She was 97.         Dr. Davidoff took pleasure in debunking stereotypes about the elderly and continued to see clients at her home office in New Canaan until a few weeks before her death.         In lectures and interviews, she urged older Americans to exercise, nurture friendships and retain as much independence as possible while accepting the inevitability of physical decline.         Interviewed by the author Betty Friedan for her 1993 book ''The Fountain of Age,'' Dr. Davidoff is quoted as saying, ''The older you get, the more you get to be like yourself.''         Born in Boston on Aug. 30, 1903, she was the oldest child of Lithuanian immigrants. She graduated from Simmons College in Boston in 1924.  Later, she earned a master's degree from Radcliffe College and, in 1961, a doctorate from Teachers College, Columbia University.         In 1926, she married Leo Davidoff, a neurosurgeon who became one of the founders of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. He died in 1975.         Dr. Davidoff is survived by four children, Helen Hirsch of Englewood, N.J.; Leonore Davidoff of Wivenhoe, Essex, England; Frank, of Philadelphia; and Mary Houts of Hummelstown, Pa.; seven grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.       
         PATTI SMITH appears quietly inside Caffe Dante in Greenwich Village, her gray-streaked hair dripping wet and stringy around her long, angular face from the Sunday morning downpour. She isn't carrying an umbrella. And her soaked appearance isn't on her mind at this early hour.         The godmother of punk, Ms. Smith, is apologizing profusely, for the second time, for her no-show at the coffeehouse a couple of days earlier. She was in bed with a migraine. She keeps saying that she isn't a flake, really, even though it isn't necessary. As a rock iconoclast, she has been called a lot of things, but flaky is not one of them.         ''I very seldom, in all the years that I have been performing, even missed a performance,'' she says over a cappuccino, in a slow, gravelly voice. ''I somehow manage to pull myself together. I think it's my way of saying 'the show must go on.' ''         At 54, Ms. Smith is still easily recognizable as the androgynous waif with the defiant stare photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, her soul mate and former boyfriend, on the cover of her 1975 debut album, ''Horses.'' She slips behind a table, wearing large dark sunglasses. She says her eyes need a moment to adjust to the cafe's lighting. Her band returned at 3:30 a.m. from a concert in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ''It was a great show,'' she says.         She wears a baggy black blazer over a white T-shirt and cuffed blue jeans. A silver Coptic cross from Ethiopia dangles from her long neck. She is intriguing to look at; skinny and graceful. She has penetrating gray eyes. One wanders lazily, a birth defect.         She has walked from her town house in Lower Manhattan. (She doesn't want its exact location revealed.) She shares it with her 28-year-old companion, Oliver Ray, a guitarist in her band, and her daughter, Jesse Paris, 14, and son, Jackson, 19, from her 1980 marriage to the former MC5 guitarist Fred (Sonic) Smith, who died in 1994.         Ms. Smith is quieter than you might expect for someone who can be so volcanic on stage, and gently disarming. And she is decidedly unstarry, though she ranks among the most influential figures in rock 'n' roll.         She has never sold many albums. Her only big hit was the 1978 collaboration with Bruce Springsteen, ''Because the Night.'' Yet people who aren't even enthralled with her music respond to her rawness and passion, her intellectual curiosity.         ''I sort of straddle this interesting position,'' she says with a laugh. ''My band and I are struggling in an underground band but I seem to get a lot of attention. I don't know how the hell else to put it.''         Ms. Smith is easy to talk to. This morning, she is going on enthusiastically about William Blake, the British Romantic poet and artist. She and Mr. Ray are paying homage to Blake on Thursday with music and poems at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as an adjunct to the museum's current exhibition of his work.         When she was a child, Ms. Smith says, her love of art and poetry were inspired by reading an illustrated volume of Blake's poetry, ''Songs of Innocence and Experience.'' She totally relates to the nonconformist Blake, who died in 1827.         ''My music fits in probably about as much as William Blake's work fit in in his time,'' she says. ''I don't necessarily foresee myself being able to permeate our present culture, but if I keep doing my work, it will be there for people who seek it and need it. So, I will continue my work as long as I think I have something to say.''         MS. SMITH grew up in a blue-collar family in South Jersey, the eldest of four children. Her mother was a Jehovah's Witness who worked as a waitress, and her father, who died in 1999, was a factory worker. Raised as a Jehovah's Witness, Ms. Smith broke away from the religion as an adolescent when she was told there was no room for art in Christ's Kingdom.         She began performing in the early 1970's at CBGB, the club on the Bowery that was the cradle of punk rock. Then, in the 1980's, she essentially checked out of the music business for 16 years when she moved with her husband to his hometown, Detroit, became a homemaker and started a family. ''Raising children is one of the hardest tasks there is,'' she says.         With her latest album, ''Gung Ho,'' being well received, she gets a bit peeved at all the talk of her comeback. The album is her eighth.         ''If one is an artist, one is an artist within. You take what you are with you. I didn't come back, because I never went anywhere. As an artist, I stayed true to myself and true to my work.''         In Caffe Dante, Ms. Smith is standing. It is Father's Day, and a candle is to be lit by her daughter in remembrance. Her husband's death in 1994 was followed a month later by that of her brother Todd, who died of a stroke.         Despite her losses, Ms. Smith is upbeat as she briskly strides home in the rain. ''Life is the best thing we have.''         Her town house is still silent. Up one flight of stairs, she walks into a disheveled workroom filled with piles of books and ragtag furniture. Her drawings are hanging there. Ms. Smith crouches, pointing and explaining how she is trying through her delicate pencil work to capture the Resurrection of Christ.         She then moves into a cluttered little study where she has a whole set of Blake's work to read. ''It's like reading the Bible. I'm going to eventually read it from beginning to end.''         Now, if you want to see this rocker light up, just tell her how very Blakean she seems.         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Adele Dellenbaugh Hofmann, a pediatrician who helped tailor medical science to the needs of teenagers, died on Friday at a hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 74 and lived in nearby Laguna Beach.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         A practitioner of pediatrics for nearly 50 years, Dr. Hofmann was a leader in a movement to redefine how health professionals treated minors. She blended her knowledge of endocrinology, pediatrics, psychology and general medicine to shape  adolescent care into a pediatric specialty.         Dr. Hofmann was a founder of the Society for Adolescent Medicine, based in Blue Springs, Mo. and served as its president in 1976-77. The next year she founded the Section on Adolescent Health as a unit within the American Academy of Pediatrics; the section now gives an award in her name.         Dr. Hofmann contended that the passage to adulthood and emancipation meant difficult years for both child and parent.         ''What we're talking about is a decade,'' she once said, ''an age of human growth and development that has tremendously unique things happening emotionally and biologically.''         Over the years she published many articles on the legal rights of minors, teenage behavior and sexuality, and youths with special risks. Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Donald Graydanus wrote the authoritative textbook ''Adolescent Medicine.'' First published in 1986, it won an award from the American College of Internal Medicine the year after and went into its third edition in 1997 at McGraw Hill, where it remains in print.         She also wrote ''The Hospitalized Adolescent'' (1976), which received an American Nurses Association award, and ''Consent and Confidentiality in Child and Adolescent Care'' (1984).         Adele Dellenbaugh was born in Boston, a granddaughter of Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh, an artist, writer and explorer. She graduated from Smith College in 1948 and from the University of Rochester Medical School in 1952.         She trained at Babies Hospital of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and was a National Foundation Fellow in Endocrinology at Presbyterian Hospital. She directed pediatric and adolescent programs at New York University, Bellevue Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in New York. After moving to California, she was affiliated with the Children's Hospital of Orange County and the University of California at Irvine.         Dr. Hofmann's marriage to Dr. Frederick G. Hofmann ended in divorce. He died in 1992. She is survived by a daughter, Annie Gardiner of Oakland, Calif., and a son, Peter, of Middletown, Conn.       
         Modjadji V, the last of a line of rain queens and the only woman who was a tribal ruler in modern-day southern Africa, died on Thursday in a clinic in Petersburg, South Africa. She was 64.         Although modern meteorology and politics have robbed the mysterious Modjadjis of the awe that once protected their tiny tribe, the Lobedu, her death created a succession crisis. Her 20-year-old granddaughter, Makhaele, who was to have succeeded her as Modjadji VI, died on Monday. Makhaele's mother died years ago.         The queen died of renal and heart failure, according to the Pietersburg Medi-Clinic. The cause of the younger woman's death has been given only as ''a short illness.''         A spokesman said the family was upset that the world had been notified before succession could be discussed or funeral arrangements made. Although Modjadji V refused to discuss ceremonial secrets, a 1937 anthropological text says the queens' decaying bodies were stored for weeks and water poured over them to create a rain-making potion. The earliest Modjadjis were never seen and were said to be immortal.         For generations, the Lobedu were left unmolested by more powerful neighbors, the Zulu and Swazi, for fear of their queens' power over the rains. In times of drought, caravans of gifts were sent up to their village, also called Modjadji, in the Drakensberg Mountains. The high valley around the village is sort of a climatic anomaly: set on dry slopes above a drier plain, it squeezes enough rain from the clouds blown off the Indian Ocean to grow bananas. The nearby Modjadji Forest is full of rare cycads, fern-like trees that date to the time of the dinosaurs.         Anthropological texts say the line of Modjadjis started in 1800, when Mugodo, a chief of the Dzugudini tribe, had a vision that he must marry his daughter and found a female dynasty. Oral tradition is grander: it says the Lobedu come from ancient Ethiopia and built the stone fortress of Great Zimbabwe.         Officially, no Modjadji marries a man; like African kings, they take several spouses, but bear children by secret consorts.         The queen, a spokesman said, is both a secular and religious leader, and is ''mother, father and child -- three persons in one.''         Although she was visited by leaders of African Christian sects, Modjadji V was not Christian. ''I am baptized by my own god,'' she said in an interview.         Four years ago, Modjadji said no one any longer asked her to make rain; young people, she complained, had lost touch with religion. That created financial problems. Her office demanded cash gifts of about $50 for interviews, and she was not shy about counting the money herself before saying a word. She owned a leopard-skin cloak that had been in the family for five generations but could be found sitting barefoot on the mud stoop of her thatched reception hut.         Although she had asked the provincial government to encourage tourism to her village, she had little patience with visitors and is still famous for having kept President Nelson Mandela waiting.         He was not the first political visitor. White presidents paid obeisance even in the days when blacks could not vote. F. W. de Klerk visited her when he was president, and his predecessor, P. W. Botha, visited her mother. Zanele Mbeki, wife of President Thabo Mbeki, is expected to attend her funeral on Sunday.         Unseasonable rains hit Johannesburg on Thursday and continued this evening.         Correction:  July 13, 2001, Friday  An obituary on June 30 about Modjadji V, a rain queen and tribal ruler in South Africa, misidentified the member of her family who died a few days before she did. It was her daughter, Mmakheala, not her granddaughter, Makobo.       
         Imogene Coca, the saucer-eyed, rubber-faced comedian who teamed with Sid Caesar on NBC's ''Your Show of Shows'' and kept America's Saturday night television audiences in stitches for five years in the early 1950's, died yesterday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 92.         Her leer was superb, her wink epochal. Her eyebrow could rise to moronic bewilderment or descend to gold digger torch time. Her chin could jut out with the indignation of a dowager caught cheating at canasta or vanish into the pathos of an abandoned woman. And the wide, silent mouth could curl into almost anything: outrage, boredom, smugness, sweet innocence, and on and on.         To millions, that face -- elfin, mischievous, wistful -- was the funniest thing on television in television's golden age. With Mr. Caesar, who was the top star and got most of the punch lines, Ms. Coca spoofed movies, society matrons, marital bliss and everyday life with extraordinary pantomimes, with a chanteuse voice that seemed always on the edge of a screech, with toe dances that laid waste to Debussy's ''Afternoon of a Faun.''         A child of vaudeville performers who lived out of a trunk and put her on the stage as an 11-year-old song-and-dance girl, Ms. Coca drifted from nightclubs in the 1920's to variety shows and Broadway revues in the 1930's. She was often out of work until her television career began, and then it was rags to riches: $10,000 a week, a $1 million contract.         From 1949, when they began tickling television audiences in the ''Admiral Broadway Revue,'' the forerunner of ''Your Show of Shows,'' to 1954, when they split up, Ms. Coca and Mr. Caesar were one of television's most hilarious and successful combinations, reaching peak audiences of more than 25 million people that swamped the competition.         ''Your Show of Shows'' did more than dominate the Saturday night viewing habits of the American household. The 90-minute show started the careers of some of the nation's most successful writers and performers and set comedic standards that gave rise to Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin and others. For many viewers old enough to remember, the show still represents television comedy at its most inventive.         Sex, politics and religion were out of bounds for television comedy in that era. So ''Your Show of Shows,'' which also starred Carl Reiner and Howard Morris and at various times counted Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and Woody Allen among its writers, had to be fashioned out of the broader terrain of everyday life, which gave the comedy a timeless, classic quality.         Blending lunatic fantasy and more contortions than a fun house mirror, Ms. Coca caricatured the foibles of housewives, spinsters, opera singers, ballet dancers, pouting flappers and haughty socialites, while Mr. Caesar provided the stoicism of a luckless schlemazel and wacky foreign accents -- memorably, a fastidious Prussian with a ''geschmutzik'' monocle who dons a bemedaled tunic and braided military cap and barks orders at his aide-de-camp: ''Brushin' a Prussian!'' ''Perfuma-schpritzen!'' -- then marches off to his job as a doorman.         The sketches were never about very much, often just an idea: a wife trying to hide the fact that she has just smashed up her husband's car, a roof leaking on an elegant dinner party, a catered boardroom lunch that lurches into chaos over who gets the chopped liver as a slavering chairman lusts after a pickle wagged by his vice chairman.         In one pantomime, Ms. Coca, Mr. Caesar, Mr. Reiner and Mr. Morris were life-size mechanical figures on a Bavarian town clock, trotting out to strike the hours -- hammer on anvil, a splash of water from a dipper, a wheezing bellows -- until the thing goes madly, progressively to pieces, leaving all the quaint lederhosen figures drenched, battered and sprung.         In another, Ms. Coca was a wife posing for her amateur photographer husband, who could not quite satisfy himself about her face. Poking here, pushing there, he kept rearranging her features, which froze where he put them. Finally, he got it right: her left eye shut in a grotesque wink, the right following him around the room like a searchlight. The husband-and-wife routines -- dubbed ''The Hickenloopers'' -- became a staple of marital rapture and catastrophe.         In ''The Sewing Machine Girl,'' a sendup of sweatshops, Ms. Coca, with Mr. Reiner as a badgering, leering boss, worked faster and faster, drooping lower and lower, until at last she gave up, did a whirling dervish dance of consumption, collapsed in death throes and, sprouting wings, flew up to heaven on wires.         In ''From Here to Obscurity,'' a parody of Fred Zinnemann's film ''From Here to Eternity,'' Ms. Coca played the hard, innocent bar girl and Mr. Caesar her boxing-bugler soldier, tragic lovers in Hawaii on the eve of war. At last, they are alone together on a beach, in swimsuits under the moonlight. You can hear the romantic music, the waves rolling in.         ''I love you,'' she says passionately.         They start to embrace.         And water -- about a bucketful -- splashes in their faces.         ''I love you,'' he says gamely.         Dripping, bedraggled, shivering, she can hardly keep a straight face as another bucketful hits them.         ''There's one thing I have to ask,'' he says.         ''Yes?''         ''Did you bring a towel?''         Ms. Coca's musical satire came from a well-trained but not powerful voice. She could turn a Wagner aria into a nightmare of brow-knitted concentration, quavering glissandos and narrow escapes from tonal disaster -- just the reverse of a young singer approaching a difficult passage, the mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens once said. ''You're always deathly afraid the young singer will never make the last note,'' she said. ''With Imogene, you're always afraid she will.''         Her dance spoofs were also a result of years of training, and were far more subtle than most audiences realized, extracting humor not by stumbling around but by finely exaggerated professional movements. In ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' she traipsed off in amorous pursuit of a prancing satyr, eventually making her capture by pouring salt from a shaker over his little goat tail.         But it was Ms. Coca's flexible face and her talents as a pantomime that delighted most audiences. ''Imogene can look so abandoned that you wonder if she ever had anybody to abandon her in the first place,'' a friend said. And Max Liebman, who produced and directed ''Your Show of Shows'' for NBC, said, ''The great thing about Imogene is that one nostril never knows what the other is doing.''         At the height of her success, Ms. Coca, who won an Emmy as the best actress of 1951, was making $10,000 a week. After ''Your Show of Shows'' ended in 1954, NBC gave Ms. Coca her own half-hour show and a 10-year, $1 million contract. She was paid half that sum in the first year, but her show faltered and she gave up the balance of the contract.         Ms. Coca subsequently appeared in nightclubs, Broadway plays, films and many television specials. In 1958, she and Mr. Caesar were reunited for an ABC program that ran 18 weeks. And in 1967, ''The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris Special'' won an Emmy Award for the year's best variety show. But, critics said, the old Caesar-Coca magic was not quite there.         From 1950 to 1954, they had made 160 editions of ''Your Show of Shows.'' Those were the years before videotape, when television was live and programs -- classics or not -- vanished into the ether. But Mr. Liebman, the producer, kept ''Your Show of Shows'' on kinescopes, 16-millimeter films.         Last year, like a long-delayed punch line, the staff of the City Center in Manhattan found 47 dusty boxes of long-lost scripts and other memorabilia (but no kinescopes) from ''Your Show of Shows,'' the ''Admiral Broadway Revue'' and other pioneering television productions. They had been stashed away in a closet in an office suite where Mr. Caesar, Ms. Coca and their writers created shows, and had apparently lain undisturbed for nearly 40 years.         In 1973, Mr. Liebman and Mr. Caesar created and released ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows,' '' a selection of some of the best skits in a 35-millimeter enlargement that went into the nation's movie houses and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences. Videotapes have since made ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows' '' widely available to a new generation of fans.         Among its offerings, ''At the Movies'': A poor sap (Mr. Caesar) goes into a theater to relax. He chews 10 sticks of gum while eating handfuls of popcorn. A woman (Ms. Coca) comes in and sits next to him. She begins to squirm and fidget with her skirt. Soon, they are both squirming and fidgeting.         Her jealous boyfriend (Mr. Reiner) enters and accuses them of meeting secretly. The lovers quarrel. The sap moves over one seat, trying to stay out of it. To defy her boyfriend, she moves over and kisses him. (''I'll kiss the fathead if I want!'') Enraged boyfriend attacks unresisting sap. Finally, the lovers make up and depart, arm in arm, leaving the bystander mauled and in tatters.         In 1963, Ms. Coca starred with Jack Lemmon in the film ''Under the Yum Yum Tree'' and in a television comedy called ''Grindl,'' about the adventures of a maid. She later appeared in nightclubs and regional playhouses and in 1979 was in a Broadway revival of ''On the Twentieth Century.''         Imogene Coca was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 18, 1908, the daughter of José Fernandez de Coca, a violinist and vaudeville band leader, and Sadie Brady Coca, a dancer who also performed in a magician's act.         When the Cocas were not on the road, home was a tumultuous Philadelphia household where singers, dancers, actors, gag men and acrobats kept life in a constant swirl. An only child, Imogene spent her early years in the theaters where her parents worked. At the age of 5, she began piano lessons; at 6, singing lessons, and at 7 dancing lessons.         She went to school in Atlantic City for several years, but by the age of 11 was performing in vaudeville. At 13, she was singing in a slinky black dress at the Dixie in Manayunk, Pa., and at 15 was performing in Jimmy Durante's Silver Slipper Club in New York. She made her Broadway debut at 17 in the chorus line of ''When You Smile'' in 1925.         For years, she bounced from show to show, when employed at all. Finally she got a lucky break. Shivering in a chilly theater while rehearsing for Leonard Sillman's ''New Faces of 1934,'' Ms. Coca, a lesser light to Henry Fonda and other young stars, wrapped herself in someone's huge coat and began clowning around: a fan dance with flapping ends. Mr. Sillman saw it and put it in the show. The show flopped, but critics hailed Ms. Coca as a rising comedian.         In another flop, ''Fools Rush In,'' she met Robert Burton, an actor. They were married the day after the play closed in 1935. Mr. Burton, who became a record company executive, died in 1955. In 1960, Ms. Coca married King Donovan, an actor she had met on a summer theater tour. They often performed together in plays and variety shows. Mr. Donovan died in 1987.         Ms. Coca had no survivors.         A small woman -- 5 feet 3 and 100 pounds -- Ms. Coca was shy offstage, a gentle, unassuming, sensitive person, friends said.         Someone who worked with her remembered that once in the chaos of a rehearsal for ''Your Show of Shows'' on a night when the cast was tired and nerves were frayed, when lines were lost and nobody believed it would all come together for the cameras at 9, Ms. Coca suddenly twisted her face into an appalling moue.         The tension dissolved in an uproar of laughter.         ''She had the wonderful faculty of understanding,'' the friend said.         Correction:  June 7, 2001, Thursday  An obituary of the comedian Imogene Coca on Sunday referred incorrectly to a Broadway production of ''On the 20th Century'' in which she appeared. It was the original one, which opened in 1978, not a 1979 revival.       
         Beate Uhse, who as a destitute war widow sold birth control pamphlets from a bicycle before going on to develop Europe's biggest emporium of erotic goods, died on Monday in a hospital in Switzerland. She was 81.         Her company, Beate Uhse A.G., based in the northern German city of Flensburg, said the cause was pneumonia.         She personified the revolution in sexual attitudes that spread across Europe during her lifetime. And her business career began in a time when selling contraceptives to the unmarried was illegal in Germany, as were sexually explicit materials.         Undeterred by scrapes with the law, she flourished when social and legal barriers fell. As staid German attitudes mellowed, her frank, humorous nature and business acumen gained her a degree of respect.         At her death she headed the supervisory board of Beate Uhse A.G., which had reported $100 million in annual revenues at the approach of 2000. The company is listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, employs 1,000 people and runs strings of boutiques and cinemas, a mail-order house and a film studio.         Her shops, which extend from Poland to Portugal, sell everything from contraceptives to sex toys, from movies to lingerie, though she drew the line at sadomasochism.         In 1996, Beate Uhse (pronounced bay-AH-teh OO-zeh) opened a three-story sex museum not far from the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. The museum contains more than 3,000 objects, ranging from kitsch to 17th-century Asian art.         Most recently, her business, ranked 79th among publicly traded German companies, was said to be taking a fresh look at the American market. And to counter the business's invasion of gasoline stations, German church leaders were envisioning setting up chapels along highways.         Beate Köstlin was born in October 1919 in what then was German East Prussia. As a girl, she idolized Charles Lindbergh and as a teenager learned to fly. Among the first women allowed to fly fighter planes for the Luftwaffe, she ferried aircraft to the front lines during World War II. She married another pilot, Hans-Jürgen Uhse, who was killed in the war, as were her parents.         At war's end in 1945, with the Soviet Army approaching Berlin, she flew north with her 2-year-old son and wound up with thousands of other refugees in a small town near the Danish border. She tried to support herself and her child by selling toys, but soon realized that the women around her needed advice about birth control.         The subject had been taboo in Hitler's Germany and condoms were difficult to find. So she bicycled from village to village with mimeographed sheets telling what she had learned from books and from her mother, who was a doctor, about the rhythm method.         She soon added contraceptives and used mail drops to advertise her inventory, which filled eight pages by 1949. The campaign covered West Germany and included brochures with advice on sex.         She bought a publishing house, built a printing plant and in 1962 opened her first shop in Flensburg. Others followed in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin, but it was in 1975 that the liberalization of West German laws admitted her to the big leagues of commerce.         Long shunned by conservatives and feminists alike, she claimed vindication in 1999 when the symbol of Beate Uhse A. G. -- USE -- crossed the board of the Frankfurt stock exchange.         ''What I am happiest about,'' she told the German news agency DPA that year, ''is that we have in the last 50 years succeeded not only greatly in business, but also in being accepted in society.''       
         Eudora Welty, whose evocative short stories, notable for their imagery, sharp dialogue and fierce wit, made her a revered figure in contemporary American letters, died yesterday at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 92.         She was plagued by health problems and had been confined for some time to her home, where she had lived since high school and where she wrote most of her stories, novels, essays, memoirs and book reviews.         As a short-story master, Miss Welty is often mentioned by critics in the same breath as Chekhov, but she was  dismissed early in her career as a regionalist and did not earn widespread critical respect until she was no longer young. When recognition came, she accepted it with the ease, modesty and grace that had become her hallmarks.         She was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel ''The Optimist's Daughter.'' She also received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, several O. Henry Awards and the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and received the Medal of Freedom in 1980, presented, she said happily, by ''one of my great Southern heroes, President Jimmy Carter.''         Late in 1998 Miss Welty said she was ''excited and delighted'' to learn that she had become the first living writer to be included in the prestigious Library of America series of collected works by United States literary giants. The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.         For decades she was pigeonholed by critics who placed her with Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers as a writer of the so-called Southern School. Her reputation as a regional and apolitical writer was often cited as a reason for her failure to win a Nobel Prize. But her work, like that of those other Southern writers, transcended region and possessed a universal relevance and appeal.         ''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980. ''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''         A Clan of Readers         Eudora Welty was born on April 13, 1909, in Jackson, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty, an Ohio native, and the former Chestina Andrews, who had been a West Virginia schoolteacher. The Weltys settled in Jackson shortly after their marriage, and Mr. Welty became an executive of the Lamar Life Insurance company. They also had two sons younger than Miss Welty.         The Weltys were devoted to books and learning. In ''One Writer's Beginnings,'' Miss Welty's 1984 memoir based on a series of lectures she gave at Harvard, she recalled the exhilaration she felt when she fell under the spell of books.         ''It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that storybooks had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass,'' she wrote. ''Yet regardless of where they came from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''         Miss Welty was a daily visitor to the local Andrew Carnegie Library, where she was allowed what she later called ''a sweet devouring'' -- a ration of two books a day by the stern-faced librarian. Several decades later, in 1986, the building was replaced; the new one was named the Eudora Welty Library.         Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.         ''It took Latin to thrust me into a bona fide alliance with words in their true meaning,'' she wrote. ''Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence. I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''         'Listening for Stories'         Miss Welty said she discovered stories in daily life. ''Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories,'' she wrote in 1984. ''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''         Miss Welty attended the Mississippi State College for Women, where she helped to start a literary magazine, and then the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1929. After college Miss Welty told her parents that she wanted to be a writer, but she said that her father insisted that she ''learn something to fall back on'' to support herself, so she took advertising courses at the Columbia University School of Business.         Back in Jackson in the early 1930's, Miss Welty wrote for a radio station and contributed society items to The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. During the Depression she got a publicity job at the Works Progress Administration, which enabled her to travel throughout Mississippi. She was troubled and fascinated by the people she saw and took hundreds of snapshots with a cheap camera, developing her prints in her kitchen at night. In 1971 Random House published a collection of these pictures, ''One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression.'' The book's stark, often grim black-and-white photographs revealed that Miss Welty's long-admired sense of observation was not limited to the ear.         ''I learned quickly enough when to click the shutter,'' she said later, ''but what I was becoming aware of more slowly was a story-writer's truth. The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it. In my own case, a fuller awareness of what I needed to find out about people and their lives had to be sought for through another way, through writing stories. I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''         The Depression pictures were exhibited in New York in 1936, the same year that Miss Welty, who had sent dozens of unsolicited stories to magazines, finally made her first sale. A small literary magazine called Manuscript accepted ''Death of a Traveling Salesman,'' the often anthologized recounting of the last day in the life of a lonely, ill and frightened shoe salesman who loses his way in rural Mississippi. Before he dies of a heart attack, he realizes fleetingly how little he has understood about himself and others.         It was the first of several stories published in small magazines. ''None of these publications paid, not really,'' Miss Welty recalled years later. ''Oh, I think The Southern Review was giving $25 a story, but it took two years before an agent could place one of my stories in a national magazine.''         Life at the P.O.         Miss Welty began to attract attention after The Atlantic Monthly published two of her stories destined to become classics: ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' and ''A Worn Path.'' The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office. The second won Miss Welty her first of six O. Henry Awards.         Early admirers of her short stories pressed Miss Welty to try her hand at a novel, but she resisted for several years. Her first hardcover book was a 1941 short-story collection, ''A Curtain of Green,'' with an introduction by Katherine Anne Porter, who had encouraged her early on. ''A Curtain of Green '' sold only 7,000 copies in 30 years, but the 17 stories in the collection became widely known and valued through their inclusion in many anthologies and college textbooks.         The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.' to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''         ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' combined Miss Welty's antic sense of humor with her pleasure in language. As the narrator prepares to leave her family's home, she says: ''So I hope to tell you I marched in and got the radio. And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot . . . The thermometer and the Hawaiian ukulele were certainly mine, and I stood on the stepladder and got all my watermelon-rind preserves and every fruit and vegetable I put up, every jar.''         An Internet Legacy         Many years later Eudora, the widely used e-mail program, was named after Miss Welty because its designer, Steven Dorner, said he had been processing so much e-mail that he felt like the Welty character who lived at the post office.         In 1941 Miss Welty followed ''A Curtain of Green'' with ''The Wide Net and Other Stories,'' and in 1942 she published ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' a novella that later became a successful musical in an adaptation by Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman. Her first full-length novel, ''Delta Wedding,'' appeared in 1946.         Three years later, a group of stories set in Morgana, an imaginary small town on the Mississippi Delta, was published under the title ''The Golden Apples.'' All of Miss Welty's gifts for compression, metaphorical language and poetic structure were on display. So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart. In the story ''The Whole World Knows,'' she charted a doomed meeting between a young couple who were estranged:         ''There in the flower beds walked the same robins. The sprinkler dripped now. Once again we went into the house by the back door. Our hands touched. We had stepped on Tellie's patch of mint. The yellow cat was waiting to go in with us, the door handle was as hot as the hand, and on the step, getting under the feet of two people who went in together, the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water -- ''Watch out for Mama's!'' -- a thousand times we had gone in like that. As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''         During World War II, Miss Welty was briefly on the staff of The New York Times Book Review and sometimes contributed reviews under the pseudonym Michael Ravenna. But she returned to Jackson during the 1950's, when her mother and brothers fell seriously ill. For almost 15 years, from the mid-50's to the late 60's, she published just a few short stories, some book reviews and a children's book, ''The Shoe Bird'' (1964). During this period she cared for her family and worked on two novels. Some writers speculated that she also suffered some spiritual ordeal or artistic crisis. After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''         Miss Welty's stories often reflected the fruits of her wide reading and special interests. ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.         In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.         Fiction of Family Life         That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life. They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.         Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders. Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she  demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager. This novel was adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and became a hit when it opened on Broadway in 1956.         Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place. We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way. We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations. We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''         And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?' ''         ''I didn't need their pointers to know that there was injustice among human beings or that there was trouble,'' she continued. ''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this. I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else. Whatever else makes them up interests me.''         Miss Welty made one notable exception to her rule against direct crusading when Medgar Evers, the black civil rights leader, was shot to death by a sniper in Jackson in 1963.         ''I did write a story the night it happened,'' she said. ''I was so upset about this, and I thought: I live down here where this happened and I believe I must know what a person like that felt like -- the murderer. There had been so many stories about such a character in the stock manner, written by people who didn't know the South, so I wrote about the murderer intimately -- in the first person, which was a very daring thing for me to do.''         In the Mind of an Assassin         The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested. Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath. Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.         Miss Welty never married. (Marriage, she said, ''never came up.'') She leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she was a shy person, she had many friends who were writers, among them Porter, Robert Penn Warren, Elizabeth Bowen, V. S. Pritchett, Cleanth Brooks, Shelby Foote, Walker Percy, Elizabeth Spencer, Ross MacDonald and Reynolds Price. She also had an enduring friendship with Diarmuid Russell, the agent who fiercely and devotedly represented her.         Her friends often spoke of her innate courtesy, which led her to seldom turn down requests for interviews. Those conversations usually took place at her home, and she often offered her interviewer bourbon and a home-cooked meal. She was warm and humorously self-deprecating.         One unlikely caller was Henry Miller. Miss Welty's mother, who had heard that Miller was a writer of obscene books, banned him from  their house. When Miss Welty did see him, she reported that he was ''the dullest man I ever saw in my life.''         ''He wasn't interested in anything outside himself,'' she said, ''that was the truth.''         In 1943, Faulkner wrote an unsolicited letter to Miss Welty after he had by chance read ''The Robber Bridegroom.''         ''You're doing all right,'' he said. That letter was hung near her wooden desk in an upstairs room in the Tudor-style house that her father built on Pinehurst Street in 1925, when she was 16.         ''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said. ''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''         Correction:  July 25, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the author Eudora Welty yesterday misstated the number of O. Henry Awards she received for short stories and misidentified the first of her stories to win one. The total was eight, not six. The first was for ''Petrified Man'' (1939); ''A Worn Path'' won in 1941.       
         Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ''Ding Dong School'' in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93.         Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ''How are you today?'' She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style.         Then, ''Miss Frances'' would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons:         ''Ask your mother where to play with it,'' for a homemade musical instrument.         ''Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,'' for a messier project.         The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material.         ''Ding Dong School'' began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959.         ''Ding Dong School,'' directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian.         Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ''actually taught kids things,'' Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ''high-tech, dazzly stuff'' of today, ''it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,'' he said.         ''The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,'' he said. ''The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching.''         Its daily competitors at the time were ''Captain Kangaroo'' on CBS and ''Mickey Mouse Theater'' on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ''Ding Dong School'' appeared: ''Sesame Street'' and ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''         In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953.         ''She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,'' The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ''She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers.''         When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ''heartbreaking.''         ''The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,'' he wrote.         In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be.         ''I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,'' she said in a 1955 interview. ''It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,'' she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown.         She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it.         What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ''new doors and windows'' of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said.         Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942.         In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children.         For more than two decades before first ringing the ''Ding Dong'' bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago.         But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II.         ''Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,'' she said.       
         Carole Honig Klein, a biographer and author of other nonfiction works, died on Monday from injuries after being struck by a car on the Upper East Side. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Klein's most recent work was ''Doris Lessing: A Biography'' (Carroll & Graf, 2000). That was preceded a year earlier by ''Doris Lessing: In This World but Not of It'' (Little, Brown).         Much of her writing reflected her special interest in psychology, especially children, childhood experiences and relationships between parents and children. Besides her books, she wrote numerous magazine articles and book reviews.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Klein graduated from Goddard College with a bachelor's degree in English and women's studies, followed by a master's degree in sociology and psychology. Over the years she taught English, creative writing and women's studies at Goddard, the State University of New York and New York University. She also was on the writing faculty of New School University in New York City and lectured widely on writing, women writers, women's issues and cultural history.         Early in her career Ms. Klein tried her hand at writing comedy. In the 1950's she wrote for Steve Allen's ''Tonight'' show on NBC.         Her book ''Aline'' was a biography of Aline Bernstein, a scenic and costume designer of the 1920's and 1930's (Harper, 1972). She was also the author of ''The Single Parent Experience'' (Walker, 1973), ''The Myth of the Happy Child'' (Harper, 1975), ''How it Feels to Be a Child'' (Harper, 1975) and ''Gramercy Park: An American Bloomsbury'' (Houghton, 1987).         Ms. Klein is survived by a son, William S. of Washington; a daughter, Emily McGrath of Manhattan; a brother, Les Honig of California; and three grandchildren. Her husband, Ted U. Klein, died last year.       
         Margaret Kilgallen, an artist who contributed to the vibrant fusion of graffiti art, folk art, painting and installation art that emerged in San Francisco in the 1990's, died Thursday in San Francisco. She was 33.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Kilgallen was born in Washington and raised in Kensington, Md. She received a B.A. in studio art and printmaking at Colorado College before moving to San Francisco. Exposed to bluegrass music as a child, Ms. Kilgallen was a skillful banjo player. In San Francisco she took up surfing, becoming equally adept. In 1990 she met her future husband, Barry McGee, also a surfer, and one of several young painters showing in galleries and painting noncommissioned murals on city walls. She and Mr. McGee, who were married in 1999, became part of a circle that included the artists Chris Johanson, Phil Frost, Ed Templeton and Thomas Campbell.         Ms. Kilgallen eventually painted hundreds of murals around San Francisco, most of which have been painted over.         Until 1997, she worked as a book conservator in the San Francisco Public Library, a job that enabled her to study traditional type fonts, which became central to her work. Her installations featured words and cartoonish figures, usually women, painted in different scales on pieces of wood that resembled shop signs, or directly on walls on top of expanses of odd, Depression-conjuring colors. (Consistent with her use of wood scrap for her signs, Ms. Kilgallen got her paint free from recycling centers, which mixed surplus colors at random.)         The overall result was impure Americana, a slightly acidic nostalgia that evoked sideshows, tramp art and old travel posters with infusions of feminist wit. Her women smoked, fought, surfed, played the banjo and occasionally hooked up with men.         Ms. Kilgallen had her first solo exhibition at the Drawing Room at the Drawing Center in New York 1997, and her second the following year at the John Berggruen Gallery in San Francisco. She had a second show in New York at Deitch Projects in SoHo in 1999. Titled ''To Friend and Foe,'' it featured floor-to-ceiling images and words and a pair of small, scrappy wood shacks painted with her signature Victorian lettering.         Ms. Kilgallen's work is currently in ''East Meets West,'' an exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia through July 29, and at Stanford University, where she received a master's degree on June 17.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Asha, who was born on June 7; her parents, Dena and James Kilgallen, of Rockville, Md.; two sisters, Lil Kilgallen of Adamstown, Md., and Marianne Sullivan of Marriottsville, Md.; and a brother, Jamie Kilgallen of Charleston, N.C.       
         Kim Stanley, whose infrequent but luminous stage portraits brought her to the edge of greatness, but who ultimately shrank from the pressures of performance and stardom, died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 76 and lived in Santa Fe.         She died after a prolonged illness, said her daughter Rachel Ryder Zahn.         In plays like William Inge's ''Picnic,'' Horton Foote's ''Traveling Lady'' and, especially, Inge's ''Bus Stop,'' Ms. Stanley captivated Broadway audiences and dazzled the critics in roles that ranged from a gauche young tomboy to a gallant abandoned wife to a well-traveled wisecracking nightclub singer.         She seemed able to take on almost any part and make it come convincingly alive. In the 1955 ''Bus Stop,'' she played Cherie, a worn-at-the-edges nightclub singer -- she calls herself a chanteuse -- who finds herself sitting out a snowstorm in a Kansas diner with her fellow bus passengers, one of whom is a swaggering cowboy. Their sparring not only won laughs, but also touched the heart.         Ms. Stanley, who later admitted to being tone deaf, even managed a deftly comic rendition of ''That Old Black Magic.'' Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, summed up her work as superb and called it a ''glowing performance that is full of amusing detail -- cheap, ignorant, bewildered, but also radiant with personality.''         Ms. Stanley had already won accolades two years earlier as the hoydenish teenager Millie Owens in ''Picnic.'' Then, cast as Georgette Thomas, a young mother whose husband has deserted her in Mr. Foote's 1954 drama ''The Traveling Lady,'' Ms. Stanley so dominated the stage that she was given star billing two days after the play's premiere.         There were more good reviews for her stage work in the years that followed. She appeared in ''A Clearing in the Woods,'' ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Cheri,'' ''A Far Country'' and ''The Three Sisters,'' among other plays, but nothing came close to her success in ''Bus Stop'' except her performance in the 1958 film ''The Goddess,'' one of her rare forays into Hollywood.         In that film Ms. Stanley won praise as a glamorous actress whose life is emotionally barren, managing to project glamour even though she was quick to concede she was no celluloid siren. She soon decided she did not much like acting for the cameras. The fragmented nature of movie making frustrated her. It was, she said, like ''shooting pool in the dark.''         Kim Stanley, whose original name was Patricia Reid, was born on Feb. 11, 1925, in Tularosa, N.M. Her parents were divorced when she was a young girl, and she and her three brothers were raised by her mother, an interior decorator who moved the family from New Mexico to Texas. Often lonely as a child, she wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming an artist or, at the very least, the local May Queen. She acted in school plays, attended the University of New Mexico and eventually graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Texas.         Her acting experiences in school had kindled a spark, she later said, but she was still thinking of pursuing a graduate degree and perhaps a career in medicine. Then she was approached by a director of the Pasadena Playhouse, who by chance had seen her perform in a college production and offered her a scholarship. She stayed at the California theater only a year, but it was enough to change the course of her life. The compass pointed toward Broadway.         After a season of walk-ons with a stock company in Louisville, Ky., where she'd gone at the urging of a friend who was working there, she boarded a Greyhound bus for New York. After a few fruitless months of making the rounds, talking to agents and trying to see producers, she turned to modeling dresses and then worked as a waitress at a hotel. She also went through a brief marriage to another aspiring actor, Bruce Hall.         The Off Broadway theater was in its infancy, but Ms. Stanley (she had taken her maternal grandmother's maiden name some years before) took an unpaid job with a Greenwich Village group called the Interplayers and lived off the money she had earned as a model. She met other promising newcomers, among them Gene Saks, Sidney Lumet and Michael V. Gazzo (later to write ''A Hatful of Rain'') and soon found herself in a new group called Off Broadway Inc.         She joined the Actors Studio, where she met and worked with the Studio's guru, Lee Strasberg, and later described him as the person ''who made it possible for the whole world to open up for me.'' Method acting, she said, was the key to becoming ''as free as possible.''         In 1949 she put her training to work at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, acting opposite Anthony Franciosa in Gertrude Stein's ''Yes Is for a Very Young Man,'' a production that drew good reviews and calls from theatrical agents. More good notices followed her next appearance, as St. Joan at the Equity Library Theater, and when the producer Kermit Bloomgarden called to invite her to replace Julie Harris in Lillian Hellman's ''Montserrat,'' she made the leap to Broadway.         Ms. Stanley married for the second time in 1949, to another actor, Curt Conway, with whom she had a son, Jamison, and a daughter, Lisa, and soon found herself torn between the conflicting demands of family and career. Performance pressures also began to take their toll, and even after her shining success in ''Bus Stop,'' stories began to circulate about her profound malaise each night at curtain time. By 1957 she had been though another divorce and remarriage, this time to the actor and director Alfred Ryder, by whom she had another daughter, Rachel. Her children survive her, along with a brother, Justin, and three grandchildren.         By the end of the 50's there were other signs of trouble. In 1958 she appeared with Helen Hayes and the British actor Eric Portman in ''A Touch of the Poet'' by Eugene O'Neill. Atkinson hailed Ms. Stanley and Ms. Hayes as ''the two finest actresses of their respective generations.'' Nevertheless, after opening night Ms. Stanley missed a number of performances. It was no secret by then that she and Portman were not on speaking terms, and it was no great surprise when Ms. Stanley abruptly left the play, blaming Portman for slapping her in one scene with what she said was excessive enthusiasm. Portman in turn declared, ''I don't go bashing people in the face,'' but Ms. Stanley was gone for good.         Such conflicts aside, she was still working at perfecting her art. ''To keep it fresh, I try to begin all over again in each performance,'' she told an interviewer. In 1959 she played a middle-aged woman in love with a handsome 19-year-old (Horst Buchholz) in ''Cherie,'' adapted by Anita Loos from two novels by Colette and set in France in the years just before and after World War I. Atkinson found her performance ''magnetic and illuminating.'' Two years later, in Henry Denker's semi-documentary 1961 play ''A Far Country,'' directed by her husband, Alfred Ryder, Ms. Stanley won praise as a young woman afflicted by hysterical paralysis who is helped by the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.         In 1964 Ms. Stanley returned to the source of her first inspiration as an actress and appeared as Masha in an  Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' directed by her old mentor, Lee Strasberg, and co-starring Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight. It was to be Ms. Stanley's last appearance on the New York stage.         The same year, in the British film thriller ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' her portrayal of a sinister London medium who, with her compliant husband (Richard Attenborough), schemes to kidnap a child, won her rave reviews and an Oscar nomination as best actress. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther described Ms. Stanley's portrait of the woman as ''a humble, cloying shrew -- an insidiously diabolic creature, and yet a pitiful victim.'' She did not win an Oscar, although the New York Film Critics gave her their best actress award. Moviegoers were not to see her again for 18 years.         In little more than a decade she had established herself as one of Broadway's most brilliant actresses although, oddly, she never won a Tony Award. She had a number of television appearances to her credit, appearing in various dramatic series and winning an Emmy in 1963 for her work in a ''Ben Casey'' episode about mercy killing. But there were only the two Hollywood films, ''The Goddess'' and ''Seance.'' And for a long while that was the sum of her career: brilliant but all too brief. She returned to her native New Mexico, put aside the stresses of performing, did some teaching in Santa Fe and nursed her ambition to have her own ensemble of actors.         By 1979, however, she was back in New York as artistic director of a troupe of actors in a small theater in SoHo. ''I want to be involved with the great plays,'' she told an interviewer, and admitted that she missed acting and intended to act again. For one thing, she said, ''before I get too old, I'd like to do Hedda Gabler,'' and, she added, she wanted to make ''a serious film about Virginia Woolf.''         As it turned out, she did neither, but she did return to films in 1982 in ''Frances,'' in which she played the ambitious, devouring mother of the actress Frances Farmer (Jessica Lange). Her performance brought her a second Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. The next year, she had a small part as a barnstorming pilot in ''The Right Stuff.'' And she returned to television in 1984, winning her second Emmy in the role of Big Mama in a PBS production of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' with Ms. Lange and Tommy Lee Jones.         There the story ended. Ms. Stanley spent her last years quietly, back in New Mexico. ''You can't be good in the theater unless you've immersed yourself in the marvelous detective story of the human spirit,'' she once told an interviewer. ''But it's difficult, terribly difficult.''         In her case the mystery remained unsolved. She had, in effect, achieved her childhood dream of becoming the May Queen, but chose to leave the parade before its end.         Correction:  August 27, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the actress Kim Stanley on Tuesday misstated the surname of her son and misidentified his father. The son changed his name to Jamison Clift from Conway in the 1980's. His father was William Brooks Clift Jr., not Ms. Stanley's second husband, Curt Conway.         The obituary also omitted a film credit for Ms. Stanley. The Actors Studio production of ''The Three Sisters'' in which she played Masha was videotaped in 1965 and transferred to film and released in 1977.       
         Aaliyah, a multimillion-selling, precociously sultry rhythm-and-blues singer and actress, died on Saturday in the crash of a small airplane, The Associated Press reported. She was returning from Abaco Island in the Bahamas, where she had been making a video clip, to Miami in a private plane, which crashed on takeoff. Eight other passengers were also killed. Aaliyah was 22 years old.         Aaliyah Haughton was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Detroit. She began singing as a child and performed in Las Vegas with Gladys Knight when she was 11.         Barry Hankerson, Aaliyah's uncle, is Ms. Knight's former husband and was the manager of R. Kelly, who specializes in amorous, slow-grind rhythm-and-blues.         Aaliyah was 14 when she made her first album, ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number,'' which was produced by Mr. Kelly and released in 1994. It sold a million copies and included two Top 10 singles, ''Back and Forth'' and ''At Your Best (You Are Love).'' Aaliyah toured the world through 1994 and 1995.         She also attended Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, majoring in dance, and she released her second album, ''One in a Million,'' as she began her senior year in 1996. It was produced by Timbaland (Tim Mosely), whose syncopated, fractured rhythm tracks made him an influential figure in 1990's pop. With guest appearances by Missy Elliott and Slick Rick, it presented Aaliyah, then 17, as a hip-hop temptress and included the hit single ''If Your Girl Only Knew.'' The album sold two million copies.         Aaliyah sang on soundtrack albums for ''Anastasia,'' ''Next Friday,'' ''Music of the Heart,'' ''Sunset Park'' and ''Dr. Dolittle,'' and had a No. 1 rhythm-and-blues hit in 1998 with the song ''Are You That Somebody'' from ''Dr. Dolittle.''         Aaliyah was featured in the movie ''Romeo Must Die'' in 2000 and was an executive producer for its soundtrack album, which included her hit single ''Try Again.'' She played the title role in the film of the Anne Rice novel ''Queen of the Damned,'' due for release next year, and had been set to appear in ''The Matrix 2.'' Her third album, ''Aaliyah,'' was released in July and reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart.         She is survived by her parents, Diane and Michael Haughton, and a brother, Rashaad.       
         Vicki Hearne, a writer who trained animals and used her poetry and prose to express her belief that pets possess courage, wisdom and intellect, died on Tuesday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 55 and lived in Westbrook, Conn.         The cause was lung cancer, family members said.         Ms. Hearne, who trained animals and their owners at Silver Trails: The Animal Inn, turned her childhood love of dogs and horses into a life's work and the foundation of a philosophy of human and animal relations and communication that was articulated in her best-known book, ''Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name'' (Knopf, 1986). In her writing she used real animals she had encountered to show that pets have not only an intellect, but also a desire to achieve and be challenged and a capacity for moral understanding.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review in The New York Times, wrote that ''Adam's Task'' ''emerges, at once, as an informed defense of animals' capacity for understanding and commitment and a philosophical meditation on the nature of learning, responsibility and language.''         Yi-Fu Tuan, in a review of ''Adam's Task'' in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that Ms. Hearne went ''out of her way to test her reader's credulity.'' He cited the book's example of a pit bull named Belle, who, he wrote, was ''capable of sizing people up 'not as bite prospects, but as problems in moral philosophy and metaphysics.' ''         ''After many excesses of this kind,'' he continued, ''I, a person who seldom can size up another metaphysically, begin to feel so inferior that I find myself retaliating by refusing to grant even the management of a 'happy grin' (as distinct from a happy smile?) to a puppy.''         And Ms. Hearne, addressing the topic from a different slant, wrote in 1984: ''These days, there is a rule among scientists against attributing human traits to animals. There used to be a rule against attributing human traits to God. So, though the definition of anthropomorphism has changed, its role as a buttress supporting the intellectual establishment's fondest superstitions has remained the same.''         Ms. Hearne may be best remembered for her defense of the much-maligned pit bull in the 1980's, when the breed's presumed ability to fight to the death was the stuff of news and urban legend. In an opinion article for The Times, she noted that an untrained eye could not always make the distinction between a pit bull and related breeds and, further, that, despite myths about lethal double jaws, pit bulls bit people less often and less seriously than many other common pets like Labrador retrievers and cocker spaniels.         In her poem ''The Bull Terrier,'' she wrote:         Their legs and backs         Should seem to be         Merely the motive         Power for the low         Broad, implacable         Jaw. They will never         Hurt a child and never         Leave justice undone,         They are justice.         She became the human hero in the story of Bandit, a dog in Stamford, Conn., who took a bite out of an intruder and ended up sentenced to death, becoming a symbol in the battle of pet owners against ordinances that banned particular breeds of dogs or put the lives of dogs deemed vicious into the hands of officials who, Ms. Hearne posited, might have a broad definition of the word.         Bandit, not a pit bull at all, but an American bulldog, endeared himself to Ms. Hearne immediately. ''Even in the most bulldoggy'' of pit bulls, she wrote, recalling the dog, ''there is something -- a sprightliness in the stance, some suggestion of the possibilities of tap dancing and vaudeville, some impish gleam of the eye to suggest the terrier.''         Bandit escaped death after Ms. Hearne challenged the authorities and won custody of the dog for three months of training. Instead of a savage beast, she found a genteel nature she described as ''terribly black tie.''         Ultimately, Bandit came to live with Ms. Hearne. Her account, ''Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog,'' was published by HarperCollins in 1991, and her experiences with Bandit were the subject of a documentary film, ''A Little Vicious.''         Victoria Elizabeth Hearne was born Feb. 13, 1946, in Austin, Tex. She worked as a self-employed animal trainer beginning in 1967. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in English at the University of California, Riverside, in 1969 and was a Stegner Fellow in Poetry at Stanford University during a year of study there.         She worked as a lecturer in creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, from 1980 to 1984 and as an assistant professor of English at Yale from 1984 to 1986. From 1989 to 1995 she was a visiting fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale.         In addition to ''Adam's Task,'' she was the author of ''Animal Happiness'' (HarperCollins, 1994) and a novel, ''The White German Shepherd'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1988); three volumes of poetry: ''Nervous Horses'' (University of Texas Press, 1980), ''In the Absence of Horses'' (Princeton University Press, 1984) and ''The Parts of Light'' (Johns Hopkins, 1994); and many essays and articles.         She is survived by her father, Willie Hearne; her husband, Robert Tragesser; a daughter from a previous marriage, Colleen Mendelsohn; and a brother, James Hearne.       
         Jane Greer, whose dolorous but luminous dark eyes and world-weary beauty made her the ideal femme fatale opposite Robert Mitchum in ''Out of the Past'' and ''The Big Steal,'' film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday in Los Angeles.  She was 76.         The cause was complications of cancer, her son Alex Lasker said.  When ''Out of the Past'' was remade 37 years later as ''Against All Odds,'' she came out of semi-retirement to play the mother of the character she had originally played in 1947.         She was never a big star, at least not by the standards of her day, and she was mostly relegated to melodramas. But when a later generation of movie buffs became attracted to Hollywood's black-and-white twisty yarns of the 1940's, they were quite taken by Miss Greer, whose face was best viewed through cigarette smoke in a bar.         In ''Out of the Past,'' she appears with both Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, who plays the heavy, Mitchum's former employer. Mitchum is trying to forget about his shabby past but is recruited by his old boss and ordered to Mexico to find Miss Greer.         The movie's crosses and double- crosses were nowhere nearly as opaque as those of ''The Maltese Falcon,'' but when Bosley Crowther reviewed it for The New York Times, he wrote that its 97 minutes of back stabbing and double-dealing were such that they had to be ''reckoned by logarithmic tables.''         Bettejane Greer was born on Sept. 9, 1924, in Washington. She started her show business career as a big band singer. During World War II, when she was about 19, her mother, who worked for the War Department, saw to it that Jane was one of three young women selected to model uniforms for the new Women's Army Corps.         Howard Hughes, the movie maker with a legendary affinity for beautiful women, saw her photograph and signed her to a personal contract. He made it clear that he didn't want her to marry anyone.         ''I found him rather endearing, like a child,''Miss Greer said of Hughes in one interview. ''His idea was to go to the amusement park,'' she said, adding, ''He won a large collection of Kewpie dolls for me.''         The photograph of Miss Greer in a WAC uniform was published in Life magazine, where it attracted the attention of Rudy Vallee, the crooner.  He called Life and tried unsuccessfully to get her address.         He found it anyhow, and proposed after a whirlwind courtship. Miss Greer accepted. The marriage lasted from 1943 to 1945. Miss Greer dropped the ''Bette'' from her name, and since she didn't think that Mr. Hughes had been using her to her best advantage at R.K.O., bought back her contract for $7,572, payable at $25 a week. When she was almost paid up, she asked Mr. Hughes to forgive the last $50. He refused.         She married Edward Lasker in 1947, the same year she made ''Out of the Past'' and ''They Won't Believe Me,'' with Robert Young and Susan Hayward; they were later divorced.         Among her other movies were ''I Married a Communist'' (1949) with Paul Lukas and Robert Ryan; ''Somebody Loves Me'' (1952), ''Down Among the Sheltering Palms'' (1952) and ''Run for the Sun'' (1956) with Richard Widmark and Trevor Howard, all made at MGM.         In 1957, she also appeared with James Cagney in ''Man of a Thousand Faces,'' the story of Lon Chaney, the silent star. After ''Billie,'' which she made in 1965 with Patty Duke and Jim Backus, she made few movies.         In addition to her son Alex, she is survived by two other sons, Lawrence and Steve; a twin brother, Don, and two grandchildren. Her companion, Frank London, an acting coach, died in January.         Years later, when one of her sons told her that she was ''Queen of Film Noir,'' she told him she really didn't know what film noir was.       
         Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin.         As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In ''Running Time: Films of the Cold War'' (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's.         In her next book, ''Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's'' (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. ''The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition,'' she wrote, ''but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted.''         Reviewing ''Previous Convictions,'' David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as ''an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments'' and whose ''natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness.'' He continued, ''Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology.''         Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote ''Annie Oakley'' (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on ''Gunga Din'' (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.         ''Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all,'' she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. ''I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics.''         In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to ''blotting out,'' she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.         It was in England that she became more politically aware -- ''they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do,'' she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was ''somewhat of a lefty.'' As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, ''On the Wing: A Young American Abroad'' (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.         Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in ''On the Wing,'' ''He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own'' and ''instilling a horror of clichés.''         She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. ''I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile,'' she told Mr. Close, ''but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then.'' Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.         Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled ''Sixties Going on Seventies'' (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions  -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.         She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. ''I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all,'' she told Mr. Close. ''I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist.'' She added: ''Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' ''         In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.         Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- ''like Richard Nixon,'' she told Mr. Close. ''It isn't all writing,'' she explained. ''Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way.''         She described herself to Mr. Close as ''of a certain age.'' She added: ''It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things.''       
         Sallie M. Wheeler, an Anheuser-Busch heiress who led a successful campaign to return the nation's oldest and most prestigious horse show to Manhattan, died on Friday at her home in Keswick, Va. She was 70.         Mrs. Wheeler, a lifelong equestrian, led efforts to return the National Horse Show to Madison Square Garden after it moved to the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1989. With its audience full of black ties and evening gowns, the show had been a highlight of the high society calendar. But, facing financial burdens, it began to lose its luster in the 1980's.         The show, a Manhattan mainstay since 1883, relocated to the Meadowlands amid rumors of impending bankruptcy. In New Jersey, the show increased in size and eliminated its debt but began to lose what Mrs. Wheeler saw as its greatest asset: its prestige.         Mrs. Wheeler believed the National Horse Show was synonymous with its original location, Madison Square Garden. Throughout the show's history, and even during its seven years at the Meadowlands, fans referred to the show as simply the Garden. The horse show is among four events that have been held at the four different Madison Square Garden buildings. Mrs. Wheeler contributed her time and fortune to make sure it went back there.         With much fanfare, the show returned to the Garden in 1996. To herald its homecoming, Mrs. Wheeler arranged for Seventh Avenue to be shut for a parade of Budweiser Clydesdales.         The heyday of the show was over, however. What was once a weeklong event was condensed into four days and eventually into two and a half. And its stature in the New York social scene was only partly restored.         Mrs. Wheeler's love of horses stemmed from her childhood. She was born Sallie Marie Busch on Aug. 22, 1931, in St. Louis to Catherine Milliken Busch and Adolphus Busch III, who became president of Anheuser-Busch in 1934.         Mr. Busch and his brother, August A. Busch Jr., were partners at the brewery and were accomplished horsemen. As a child growing up on Grant's Farm, once the home of Ulysses S. Grant, Sallie rode horses, and when her father died in 1946, August Busch helped rear her. She began to ride competitively, and at 15, she made her first National Horse Show appearance.         Supported by her stake in the family company, Sallie made a living of her love of horses. In 1965, she married Kenneth M. Wheeler, a professional horse trainer. During their more than 35 years of marriage, they raised and trained hundreds of champion horses at their farm in Keswick and participated in equestrian shows around the country.         Among the most prominent and successful exhibitors in the horse world, the Wheelers won thousands of blue ribbons, an average of 200 to 300 each year. In 1987, the American Horse Shows Association named Mrs. Wheeler its horsewoman of the year. In 1999, the organization gave the Wheelers its lifetime achievement award.         Upon receiving that award, Mrs. Wheeler said: ''It is rare that two people have so fully enjoyed a career in a profession and a hobby in a sport such as Kenny and I have been privileged to. We both realize that none of this would be possible without the fabulous animals we do dearly love and appreciate.''         Mrs. Wheeler's first marriage, to Robert Motch, ended with his death.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Wheeler is survived by five children, Sallie M. Motch of Cold Spring, N.Y., Robert Motch of Carthage, Mo., Kenneth M. Wheeler Jr. of Memphis, Gordon L. Wheeler of Harrodsburg, Ky., and Douglas B. Wheeler of Keswick, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Pauline Kael, who expressed her passion for movies in jaunty, jazzy prose as the longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died yesterday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 82.         Ms. Kael was probably the most influential film critic of her time. She reviewed movies for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1979, and again, after working briefly in the film industry, from 1980 until 1991. Earlier, she was a film critic for Life magazine in 1965, for McCall's in 1965 and 1966 and for The New Republic in 1966 and 1967.         Enchanting her fans and infuriating her foes, rarely dull and often sharp and funny, with an intellectualism that reflected her background as a student of philosophy, Ms. Kael was never anything but outspoken.         Whether dismissing auteur theory, reviewing Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' (1975) before it was finished, questioning the extent of Orson Welles's contribution to ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) or proclaiming Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' (1973) as a cultural event comparable to the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Ms. Kael was always provocative. Her seductive writing style bred a legion of acolytes, known as Paulettes.         The critic Louis Menand wrote in The New York Review of Books in March 1995: ''Kael was the most brilliantly ad hoc critic of her time, and she made it possible to care about movies without feeling pompous or giddy by showing that what comes first in everyone's experience of a movie isn't the form or the idea but the sensation, and that this is just as true for moviegoers who have been taught to intellectualize their responses to art as it is for everyone else.''         By the time she retired, Mr. Menand observed, she had produced a generation of inferior imitators. ''The manner of appreciation she invented has become the standard manner of popular culture criticism in America,'' he wrote.         Assessing her impact in a 1998 interview, Ms. Kael said: ''I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They've rarely agreed with me about movies.''         At the same time, she deflected the question of whether her criticism had had any effect on films and filmmakers. ''I'd rather not say,'' she answered. ''If I say yes, I'm an egotist, and if I say no, I've wasted my life. Although I've been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy.''         Overpraising or overdamning was Ms. Kael's way, and she left no doubt about her favorites: actors like Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, John Travolta, Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, and actresses like Joan Cusack, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver and Debra Winger.         She championed films of the 1970's, like Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' (1972) and ''Godfather, Part II'' (1974); Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' (1973) and ''Taxi Driver'' (1976); Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo'' (1975); and Mr. Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971) and ''M*A*S*H'' (1970). She also liked the sensual violence of directors like Sam Peckinpah, whose films included ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and ''Straw Dogs'' (1971), and Brian De Palma, whose works include ''Carrie'' (1976) and ''Casualties of War'' (1989).         ''You know, they talk about the golden age of the cinema as if it took place in the late 30's or in the 40's,'' she said in 1989. ''There was nothing personal and exciting in most of those movies. They were machine tooled. They were a lot of fun. But except for Preston Sturges and a few flukey individualists, they just didn't have the personal voice of the movies of the 70's.''         As a writer whose heyday spanned the years from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) to ''Awakenings'' (1990), ''Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ''L.A. Story'' (1991), Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.         In a 1968 review in The New York Times of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,'' a collection of Ms. Kael's reviews and articles, Eliot Fremont-Smith called her ''the most quotable critic writing; but what is important and bracing is that she relates movies to other experiences, to ideas and attitudes, to ambition, books, money, other movies, to politics and the evolving culture, to moods of the audience, to our sense of ourselves -- to what movies do to us, the acute and self-scrutinizing awareness of which is always at the core of her judgment.''         Reviewing ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) in treacle-curdling prose that reportedly prompted McCall's to dismiss her, Ms. Kael asked, ''Wasn't there perhaps one little Von Trapp who didn't want to sing his head off or who screamed that he wouldn't act out little glockenspiel routines for Papa's party guests, or who got nervous and threw up if he had to get out on a stage?''         Writing about Kevin Costner in ''Dances With Wolves'' (1990), she said he had ''feathers in his hair and feathers in his head.'' Writing about Robert De Niro in ''Awakenings,'' she said, ''It's in the quiet moments that he's particularly bad.'' She also said that that film contained ''another of Robin Williams's benevolent-eunuch roles.''         At her peak, she lauded popular movies like Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' (1975) and Philip Kaufman's ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978) and became more of a supporter of the auteur theory. But in time, Ms. Kael, who attracted notice early in her career by attacking critics like Bosley Crowther of The Times and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, came under fire for predictability and dogmatism.         It was inevitable that she should be the object of criticism herself. George Lucas named the villainous General Kael in ''Willow'' (1988) for her, and in a celebrated onslaught in The New York Review of Books in 1980, the writer Renata Adler declared Ms. Kael's work ''piece by piece, line by line, without interruption, worthless.''         Ms. Adler, a former film critic for The Times, wrote that Ms. Kael's recent work ''falls somewhere between huckster copy and ideological pamphleteering,'' and that ''mistaking lack of civility for vitality, she substitutes for argument a protracted, obsessional invective.''         Assessing her own work, Ms. Kael said: ''I try not to be rough on small films. Generally, when I'm really rough, it's on something that I know is going to be a big hit, and that everybody is going to go for it, and I think it's an atrocity -- that's fair game. I'm interested in discovering talent, and in trying to explain why I think someone is talented. I'm more interested in that than I am in panning.''         Over the years, Ms. Kael's reviews and essays were assembled in a series of books whose double-entendre titles suggested the intimacy of her love affair with movies (she preferred the word ''movies'' to ''film'' or ''cinema''). Among them were ''I Lost It at the Movies'' (1965); ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (1968); ''Going Steady'' (1970); ''Deeper Into Movies'' (1973), a 1974 National Book Award winner; ''Reeling'' (1976); ''When the Lights Go Down'' (1980); ''Hooked'' (1989); ''Movie Love'' (1991); and ''For Keeps'' (1994).         When the last was published, she said in the introduction: ''I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have.''         Central to her approach to criticism was her belief that the popular appeal of movies was rooted in trash. In her essay ''Trash, Art and the Movies,'' reprinted in ''Going Steady,'' Ms. Kael wrote: ''Movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip -- from what was coarse and common.''         She went on to say: ''If we've grown up at the movies, we know that good work is not continuous with the academic, respectable tradition but with glimpses of something good in trash, but we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain of discovery. Trash has given us an appetite for art.''         Ms. Kael's appetite for the movies began in childhood. The fifth child and third daughter of immigrants from Poland, Isaac Paul Kael and the former Judith Friedman, she was born in Petaluma, Calif., on June 19, 1919. She described her father as a gentleman farmer and a moviegoer, and her own trips to see films began early.         Among the favorites she recalled were comedies in the late 1920's that starred Bebe Daniels as a wisecracking flapper; ''Million Dollar Legs'' (1932), with W. C. Fields; and the Marx Brothers's ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933).         For a time the Kaels lived on their Sonoma County farm, which they lost in the Depression. Ms. Kael was 8 when her family moved to San Francisco.         ''A bookish girl from a bookish family'' is the way she once described herself. Blue-eyed, brown-haired, five feet tall and weighing a bit more than 100 pounds, she said: ''I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at 'Kentucky Moonshine,' a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to a movie again.''         In 1936 she enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in philosophy. Despite expectations that she would proceed to law school or teaching, she went to New York with a friend, the poet Robert Horan, for about three years.         When she returned to the Bay Area, she led a bohemian life, tried her hand at writing plays and helped make experimental films. Married and divorced three times, she supported herself and her daughter, Gina James, by writing advertising copy, clerking in a bookstore and working as a cook, a seamstress and a textbook writer.         Ms. Kael never wrote movie criticism until she was 35 and, she said, ''I never made a living at this until I was in my 40's.'' Her career at The New Yorker did not begin until she was nearly 50.         The turning point in her life came, as in a Hollywood script, when she was discovered in a coffee shop in the Bay Area in 1953. She was arguing about a movie with a friend when the editor of City Lights magazine asked them each to review Chaplin's ''Limelight.'' The friend turned in nothing. Ms. Kael's review called the film ''slimelight,'' and a career was born.         Soon Ms. Kael was being published in magazines like Sight and Sound and Partisan Review, and her provocative criticism was being broadcast weekly on KPFA, Berkeley's listener-supported radio station. The radio criticism led to an offer to manage an art theater, which she turned into a two-screen house, the Berkeley Cinema Guild Theaters.         ''I made the displays, wrote the program and cleaned the chewing gum off the seats,'' she said. She revived W. C. Fields, Mae West and Busby Berkeley films and Welles's ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) and showed Ingmar Bergman films before they became staples of art houses elsewhere. ''It was exciting turning up things and drawing an audience to see them,'' she said.         The feisty, funny reviews that she wrote for the programs enhanced her reputation, and she began lecturing on film at universities in San Francisco and Los Angeles.         She was 46 when her essays in Partisan Review led to an offer to publish her first book, ''I Lost It at the Movies,'' a collection of her articles and broadcasts, which became a best seller. In it she praised movies like Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (1937), Vittorio de Sica's ''Shoeshine'' (1946) and Martin Ritt's ''Hud'' (1963). She attacked other critics, poked fun at materialistic movie magnates and derided the pretensions of Alain Resnais's ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), calling it ''the snow job in the ice palace.''         Assignments from magazines began to flow in, and in 1965, Ms. Kael, her daughter and Ms. Kael's two basenjis (dogs that, interestingly, cannot bark) moved to New York.         In 1968, in response to an offer from  William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, who was willing to let her write whatever she wanted and at length, Ms. Kael began to review movies for the magazine. Until 1979, she reviewed weekly from September through March, and Penelope Gilliatt reviewed for the other half of the year.         Ms. Kael's first review for The New Yorker was virtually the only rave that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' received in New York, but it compelled other critics to reconsider their assessments.         At 59, Ms. Kael left The New Yorker for Hollywood. She briefly worked as a production executive for Warren Beatty. After that job ended over what were described as ''artistic differences,'' Paramount Pictures put her under contract as a consultant and scout for several months before she returned to The New Yorker in 1980.         Ms. Gilliatt had departed, and Ms. Kael began writing every two weeks, commuting to New York from a Victorian home on four and a half acres in Massachusetts that she bought for $37,000 in 1970. In New York, she stayed in a hotel for four days and saw two movies nightly. Back home at night, she wrote. Her daughter, an artist, lived nearby with her family.         She is survived by her daughter, Ms. James, of Great Barrington, and a grandson, William Friedman, also of Great Barrington, and two sisters, Anne Wallach and Rose Makower, both of Berkeley.         Ms. Kael was reputed never to see a film more than once, yet she seemed to remember everything, from lighting and costumes to writing, sound, direction and performances.         In 1991, at 71, after 22 years at The New Yorker, Ms. Kael retired from regular reviewing.         Looking back on her impassioned love affair with movies, she once said, ''I was a film critic the way somebody might write poetry, for fun or love.''       
         Prof. Millie Almy, a psychologist and author who was among the first to advocate special training for teachers in early childhood education, died on Aug. 15 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         Dr. Almy's early research convinced her that play was essential to healthy development and an ideal way for children to start learning the ways of the world around them. Previously, nursery school had been seen as a place to address a tot's safety and grooming, with few toys or challenging activities.         Dr. Almy was widely known for her studies of the mental, emotional and social development of the very young. Starting in the 1950's, she studied how they came to understand subjects like science and literature.         She principally taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, from which she retired in 1980.         Afterward, she was a Fulbright fellow at Macquarie University in New South Wales, Australia, and a visiting professor at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.         She wrote extensively in journals and books, some of which remain in print as classic textbooks. These include ''Children's Experiences Prior to First Grade and Success in Beginning Reading,'' ''Young Children's Thinking: Studies of Some Aspects of Piaget's Theory'' and, with Celia Genishi, ''Ways of Studying Children: An Observation Manual for Early Childhood Teachers.''         Millie Corinne Almy was born on a farm in Clymer, N.Y., and graduated from Vassar College in 1936. She received a master's in early childhood education and child development in 1945 and a doctorate in curriculum and teaching in 1948, both at Columbia Teachers College.         She started teaching at the University of Cincinnati. She returned to Columbia in 1952 and was a professor of psychology and education until 1971, the year she joined the faculty at Berkeley.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Alice Stewart Trillin -- an educator, film producer and author also known as the muse of her husband, the humorist Calvin Trillin -- died on Tuesday evening at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 63.         The cause of death was heart failure resulting from radiation damage to her heart when she was treated for lung cancer in 1976, her husband said.         She was what Sarah Lyall in a 1994 interview in The New York Times described as ''muse, cheerleader, literary interpreter, straight person and buster of bubbles,'' often appearing as a character in her husband's books. She also became an activist who wrote authoritatively about the life of cancer patients.         Because of her earlier illness, which she said was caused by her parents' heavy smoking during her childhood, she became interested in the relationship of cancer patients and doctors. In 1981 she published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine, ''Of Dragons and Garden Peas: A Cancer Patient Talks to Doctors,'' which is still used in medical schools.         In 1996 she published a book, ''Dear Bruno,'' based on a letter she had sent to a 12-year-old who had cancer. Last January she wrote a much-discussed article for The New Yorker, ''Betting Your Life,'' dealing with the way patients make medical decisions.         Alice Stewart was born on May 8, 1938, in Portchester, N.Y., the only child of Dorothy and James Stewart, a businessman and inventor specializing in the coin changers of vending machines.         She attended public school in Harrison, N.Y.; Wellesley College, where she earned B.A. in 1960, and Yale University, where she earned an M.A. in English in 1961. She taught English at Hofstra University and the City University of New York.         In the mid-1960's, she helped design a pioneering writing curriculum for the Open Admissions Program at City College, and she later became writing program specialist at the City University's instructional resource center. Her interest in curriculum design led consulting work for WNET/Thirteen when the television stations was looking for new approaches to educational programming.         In 1981 she formed Learning Designs, a company that produced award-winning educational television series like ''Behind the Scenes,'' starring the comedians Penn and Teller designed to teach 10-to-12-year-olds about the creative process in the visual and performing arts.         In 1965 she married Mr. Trillin and began to appear as the voice of occasionally deflating reason in his autobiographical writings, particularly his three books about food called ''The Tummy Trilogy'' -- ''American Fried,'' ''Alice, Let's Eat'' and ''Third Helpings'' -- as well as in ''Travels With Alice'' and ''Family Man.''         Ms. Trillin was on the faculty at New York Medical College, and a board member of The Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, which supports camps for children with cancer and blood diseases.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Abigail, of San Francisco, and Sarah, of Los Angeles.       
         Kay Teer Crawford, whose sympathy for high school girls who did not make the cheerleading squad in her Texas hometown led her to start one of the first of the drill teams, died on Aug. 29 at her home in Redondo Beach, Calif. She was 88.         Her son Kim said the reason earlier reports of her death listed her as 83 was that she had lopped five years off her age when she was 75 to increase her employment opportunities. Almost until her death, she actively promoted drill teams not just as entertainment but as a sport.         Mrs. Crawford, a cheerleader herself, came up with the concept of having sequined young women prancing about at sporting events around the time Gussie Nell Davis had the same idea with her Flaming Flashes in Greenville, Tex. Miss Davis went on to form the celebrated Kilgore Rangerettes of Kilgore College in Kilgore, Tex.         A Kilgore College history reports that Miss Davis began the Greenville troupe in 1928, two years before Mrs. Crawford started the Sergeanettes at Edinburg High School in Edinburg, Tex. But Janet Mar, Mrs. Crawford's personal assistant, insists that her boss was first with the inimitable combination of high-spirited marching, dancing and kicking that became an American tradition.         Whatever the chronology, Mrs. Crawford's contribution to the world of drill teams looms large. She brought the idea from Texas to Southern California, where she spent many years adding show-business glamour to plain old Texas strutting. She provided drill teams for 10 Super Bowls, 4 Rose Bowls and 7 Pro Bowls, and at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she put 1,268 drill team members through their lively paces.         Two years later, at the rededication of the Statue of Liberty, she fielded a team almost that large, including all-stars from every state. The next year, she helped orchestrate a celebration surrounding a mass by Pope John Paul II at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.         David Wolper, who produced the Olympic and Statue of Liberty shows, said: ''Kay recruited, trained and prepared thousands of young drill team girls for the events, and when Kay trained them, they were perfect. We have lost a real champion.''         Kay Waweehie Teer, whose mother was half-Cherokee and half-Comanche, was born on a farm near Granger, Tex., on Aug. 16, 1914. Her father moved off the farm to become the sheriff of Hidalgo County, Tex., where he made his wife and only child deputies so they could travel with him over the vast territory on official business.         He died shortly after moving to Edinburg to take a different law enforcement job. Mrs. Crawford and her mother then squatted in a succession of vacant houses, stealing from gardens to eat. Eventually, they moved in with relatives.         Mrs. Crawford won a coveted cheerleader position, but hated facing the envy and resentment of the 90 girls who did not make it. Inspired by the marching of Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets at a nearby junior college, she asked her principal to start what she at first called a spirit group, something that all the girls could join the next year. Her idea was accepted, and the Sergeanettes took the field in the fall of 1930.         ''All of the women were included,'' Ms. Mar said. ''Nobody got left out.''         Mrs. Crawford then worked her way through what is now Pan American University, where she earned an associate's degree, while cleaning toilets for money and wearing damaged clothing to make ends meet. She earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and a master's degree from the University of Texas, writing a thesis titled, ''The Educational Value of Drill Teams in the High School Curriculum.''         She took her drill team idea to El Centro High School in El Centro, Calif., and from there to San Diego High School and Santa Monica High School. She added props, from canes to matador capes, and persuaded a friend in the fabric business to develop nylon pompoms as a more versatile substitute for paper ones.         She then taught physical education and coached drill teams at Santa Monica College, whose president, Richard Moore, said, ''With her batons, hats and costumes, she established college pride, no matter what the prowess of the athletic crew.''         Mrs. Crawford coached cheerleaders for the University of Southern California, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Express of the defunct United States Football League.         She opened a drill team summer camp, started an international competition for drill teams, founded and edited a magazine on the subject of drill teams, and wrote what some consider the definitive textbook on the subject.         Her husband, James H. Crawford, died several years ago after 54 years of marriage. A teetotaler, Mrs. Crawford met him while she was volunteering to greet returning veterans at a bar; he was the one wearing a marine uniform while drinking a glass of milk, their son Kim said.         Mrs. Crawford is survived by Kim, who lives in Dana Point, Calif.; another son, Jay, of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a daughter, Jan Crawford of Torrance, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Crawford did not achieve her loftiest ambition. She had been heartily campaigning to make drill team competitions an Olympic sport.       
         Lady Jean Rankin, who held an archaic job as a Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, for more than 40 years, died in Edinburgh on Oct. 3. She was 96.         A kind of lady-in-waiting, a Woman of the Bedchamber attends to a queen's personal tasks, answers the majority of her correspondence and attends less formal functions with her.         The higher-ranking Ladies of the Bedchamber, usually the wives of earls, go to formal events with the queen, taking care of her umbrellas and gloves and so forth, according to Jerrold M. Packard in ''The Queen and Her Court: A Guide to the British Monarchy Today.''         Both groups are called ladies-in-waiting, usually work for two weeks at a time on a rotating basis and are unpaid except for essential expenses. They serve ''because they are personal friends of the queen, or for the honor and kudos the work undoubtedly brings,'' Alan Hamilton wrote in ''The Royal Handbook.''         Lady Jean, who was appointed a Woman of the Bedchamber in 1947, was only five years younger than the Queen Mother and was the last of her ladies-in-waiting to have been almost of the same generation. She accompanied the queen on tours to Paris in 1951, Norway in 1953, the United States and Canada in 1954 and Australia in 1958.         Lady Jean called the Queen Mother ''an easy boss to work for'' and was by her side when she had surgery, as well as when such nasty details as money had to be addressed on shopping expeditions.         The Times of London noted that Lady Jean was a close friend of Princess Margaret, and ''played a pivotal role during her fraught relationship with Group Captain Peter Townsend, acting as a go-between and counselor, especially during the sad period after the princess decided to call off their engagement.''         She continued to serve until 1982, when she became an Extra Woman of the Bedchamber. Until 1994, when she moved to a nursing home in Edinburgh, she continued to serve the Queen Mother from time to time, mainly accompanying her to private dinner parties.         She became something of a celebrity in her own right. The Times wrote: ''She was unflappable, conscientious, but at the same time witty and charming, with a sense of fun to match that of her boss. They suited each other down to the ground.''         Jean Margaret Florence Dalrymple was born in Oxenfoord Castle, Midlothian, on Aug. 15, 1905. Her father, the 12th Earl of Stair, owned a 75,000-acre estate. She spent her youth living in two family castles and in London. She was educated entirely by governesses.         When she was 18, she joined the editorial staff of Queen magazine, a weekly periodical. The Times observed that this was considered ''a fairly racy thing to do.''         The Daily Telegraph reported that in 1931 she met Niall Rankin, a wildlife photographer, and they soon announced that they intended to marry. Lord Stair was unwilling to bless the union because Mr. Rankin had never met his own father, due to his parents' separation. Moreover, he had no money.         So Mr. Rankin finally made the acquaintance of his father, Sir Reginald Rankin. The elder Mr. Rankin was so taken with Miss Dalrymple that he promised to leave his son all his money, The Telegraph said.         They were engaged in July 1931, and Sir Reginald died in September, leaving them a small fortune. The couple married a month later. Mr. Rankin built a reputation as a wildlife photographer and ornithologist and in 1935 received the Wild Life Photography Award of the Year from Hermann Göring.         In 1937, they bought an estate of 1,900 acres on the Isle of Mull. The property came with a 320-acre chain of inhabited islands. They planted rhododendrons and azaleas and bred geese, which Lady Jean continued to raise after Mr. Rankin's death in 1965. The property became a wildlife sanctuary in 1994.         Lady Jean is survived by her son Ian. Another son, Alick, died of cancer in 1999.         During World War II, Lady Jean worked in the Child Recovery Bureau of the Women's Voluntary Service finding homes for orphans, while her husband performed secret missions as a soldier in China. The couple's London home was destroyed by a bomb.         After her appointment in 1947, Lady Jean was in the royal court for three or four two-week periods a year. She spent much of her time farming on the Isle of Mull.         Her legacy was as a footnote to royal events. Elizabeth Longford in ''The Queen Mother'' recorded her remark about the convenience of the Royal Yacht for a traveling queen, as well as telling of the time she and the queen were thrown to the floor of their touring car in Tasmania when the car stopped suddenly.         The New York Times reported in November 1954 that the Queen Mother, whose daughter's coronation had taken place a year earlier, stopped by a day-care center during a visit to New York. She tried to quiet a crying child by offering him some macaroni and cheese.         He was comforted only when Lady Jean picked him up and held him in her arms.       
         Diana van der Vlis, the blond-haired, blue-eyed actress who caused a stir on Broadway in the 1950's hit ''The Happiest Millionaire,'' died on Monday in a hospital in Missoula, Mont., where she had a home. She was 66.         The cause of death was uncertain pending an autopsy, said her husband, Roger Donald, who said his wife had had respiratory problems.         A child of international origin -- she was born in Toronto to a Scottish mother and a Dutch father -- Ms. van der Vlis studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and acted in Canada before moving to New York in the spring of 1956.         There, in one of her first auditions, she landed the plum role of Cordelia Biddle, daughter of Col. Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, the eccentric socialite and title character of ''The Happiest Millionaire,'' a popular comedy drawn from Ms. Biddle's memoir.         Acting opposite Walter Pidgeon, Ms. van der Vlis won the type of reviews that would secure her position as one of Broadway's most sought-after ingénues. Writing in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called her ''an uncommonly talented young lady'' who ''plunges into the temperamental whirlpool of Cordelia's adolescent emotions and makes a stunning performance out of them.'' She was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance.         Much work followed. In the next few years, Ms. van der Vlis played in the Broadway productions of ''Comes a Day,'' ''A Mighty Man Is He,'' ''A Shot in the Dark'' and Gore Vidal's ''Visit to a Small Planet.''         Ms. van der Vlis also appeared in films and on television series like  ''The Man From Uncle'' and ''The Fugitive.'' Her films included ''The Incident'' (1967) and Roger Corman's ''Man With the X-Ray Eyes'' (1963).         Later, Ms. van der Vlis also appeared in two soap operas, ''Where the Heart Is'' and ''Ryan's Hope.''         In addition to her husband, Ms. van der Vlis is survived by a son, Matthew, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Adrienne of New York.       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963, and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died yesterday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks, from 40 to 60, she needs personality, and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot high ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to the old and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from the Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink top-of-the line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account. Her second husband planned to go into the business with her but died of a heart attack a month before the start of the business. She decided to carry on with her plans, despite the advice of her lawyer and her accountant. The business opened with nine saleswomen and her 20-year-old son, Richard Rogers, a sales representative for Prudential Life Insurance, as financial administrator.         The skin-care products that formed the basis of the company were developed by J. W. Heath, an Arkansas tanner who noticed that his hands looked younger than his face and began experimenting with the solution he used in his work. The formulas were passed on to his daughter, Ova Heath Spoonemore, who, sometime later, acted as the hostess at a Stanley Home Products party where Mrs. Ash was conducting the demonstration. When that part of the get-together was over, Mrs. Spoonemore handed out jars with penciled labels to her guests, all of whom had beautiful skin. She explained to Mrs. Ash that the women were her guinea pigs. Mrs. Ash, who also received some samples, became a fan and in 1963 bought the formulas from the Heath heirs for $500.         The philosophy of the fledgling company was based on three principles enunciated by Mrs. Ash -- treating others as they themselves would like to be treated, putting God first, family second and career third, and the belief that with praise and encouragement, everyone could succeed.         Although the product line was added to over the years -- there are now more than 200 items for women and men in skin, hair, nail and body care and sun protection -- the Mary Kay formula for success changed little. Consultants remained independent, buying products at wholesale and selling at retail, and from the beginning there were no accounts receivable or personal checks accepted. Orders are paid for with cashier's checks, money orders or credit cards, and consultants are encouraged to conduct their own business in the same way.         In addition to her financial policy, Mrs. Ash also decided that there would be no fixed territories. Consultants who line up recruits in other cities and states still receive commissions on the recruits' purchases although the newcomers are trained and guided by the directors in their home territories. The unusual system worked because, as Mrs. Ash put it, ''each sales director thinks 'I'm helping her but someone else is helping my recruits in other cities.' ''         Shares of Mary Kay were listed in 1968, first in the over-the-counter market and eight years later on the New York Stock Exchange. In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas, 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''

         Carrie Donovan, a fashion editor who could easily have rested on her laurels and leopard skins but came out of semiretirement to find a new and even more enthusiastic audience as ''the lady from Old Navy,'' died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ailing for several months, said George O'Brien, a friend, and died at New York Weill Cornell Center.         From the beginning, Ms. Donovan's career had a screwball quality worthy of Hollywood. Though she studied dressmaking at the Parsons School of Design, she could never master a needle and thread. She lacked a similar command of automobiles and typewriters, and as a reporter for The New York Times, then as an editor for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and The New York Times Magazine, she wrote all her copy by hand.         And though she was among the first to applaud the designs of Donna Karan and Perry Ellis and brought a virtually unknown Elsa Peretti to the attention of Tiffany, Ms. Donovan was something of an Auntie Mame when it came to managing her own affairs. Money was silk in her fingers, and the rest was often serendipity.         ''She was perfectly cast for a fashion editor,'' said Karl Lagerfeld, the designer. ''She was the leading lady of that role.''         What Ms. Donovan possessed was an eye for talent and a nose for news, a combination that, with her inevitable pearls and outsized black glasses, set her apart from her fashion sisters. She loved the fantastical, which was reflected in her Upper East Side apartment -- with its red walls, red furnishings and leopard carpeting -- but in her editorial pages she was adamantly on the side of readers. She may have been French in her leanings, sprinkling her pronouncements with French même choses, but in her translations of fashion's edicts, she was as American as Carrie.         As her mentor Diana Vreeland once told her: ''My dear, you've got the common touch!''         Nowhere did she apply this more surprisingly than in her television ads for Old Navy, which began running in fall 1997. In all, Ms. Donovan appeared in 42 spots, including one that featured her piloting an airplane with a dog named Magic. If Ms. Donovan, the last of a trilogy of great fashion dames that included Mrs. Vreeland and Carmel Snow of Bazaar, reigned in a small world, she now had fans everywhere. Teenagers and grandmothers alike hailed her in the street, sometimes singing an Old Navy jingle.         ''She was tickled pink,'' the director Joel Schumacher, a friend since the 1960's, said of her new visibility. ''It made her a celebrity.''         As a child in Lake Placid, N.Y., where Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born on March 22, 1928, she craved fashion, and struggled with home economics. At 10, she sent the actress Jane Wyman sketches for a wardrobe, and received a handwritten reply.         Her first job was in the hat department at Saks under the imperious Tatiana Liberman, whose husband was Alexander Liberman of Vogue. By the time Ms. Donovan graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1950, she had formed friendships with two of the world's leading dressmakers, Norman Norell and Jacques Fath. More would follow.         But Ms. Donovan's outgoing personality masked an ambivalent relationship with her mother, Margaret, and an isolated childhood spent with grandparents. She and her sister, Joan Donovan, saw nothing of their father, who left the family early, and the girls did not live regularly with their mother until 1942, when the independent-minded Margaret was working for a war production factory in Brooklyn. She later received a teaching degree from Columbia University.         All her career, Ms. Donovan, who  is survived by her sister, of Cambridge, Mass., left the impression that she and Margaret were opposites.         In 1955, recognizing her limitations as a designer, Ms. Donovan went to work as a fashion reporter for The Times, where, according to Mr. O'Brien, a former colleague, she felt outgunned by more experienced writers. She persevered, snaring an interview with Mrs. Vreeland in 1963, when she went to Vogue, and Ms. Donovan soon joined the magazine as one of Mrs. Vreeland's acolytes.         At Vogue, Ms. Donovan flourished, filling her pages with the new and the exciting. She wrote about a young Mr. Schumacher when he and some friends opened a shop called Paraphernalia. On another occasion, a former staff member recalled being sent out to the lobby to tell a group of young men waiting for Ms. Donovan not to sit on the floor. They turned out to be Jim Morrison and the Doors.         She inherited Mrs. Vreeland's mannerisms, like the fortissimo ''divine!'' but not her mantle, and when Mrs. Vreeland was fired from Vogue in 1971, Ms. Donovan decamped for Bazaar. By then, Ms. Donovan had switched from wearing chaste Mainbocher to chic Halston, and like her friends, the decorators Chessy Rayner and Mica Ertegun, she had taken to covering her blond bob with a turban.         Like other editors of that era, Ms. Donovan was an instigator as well as a tastemaker. In February 1974, she helped bring Tiffany and Ms. Peretti together. The designer said Ms. Donovan had the idea that contemporary jewelry would bring the white-glove store a new customer. Today, that arrangement is a $250 million business. ''Nobody would do a favor like this now,'' Ms. Peretti said.         Unable to perform similar magic at Bloomingdale's, where she worked briefly as a public relations executive, Ms. Donovan returned to The Times in 1977 as style editor of the magazine. At their first meeting, Edward Klein, then editor of the magazine, recalled that Ms. Donovan produced some colored markers and began sketching out her plans, all in a brisk monologue of ''mmm's'' and exclamation points. Mr. Klein had no idea what she was talking about.         Ms. Donovan was not unaware of her effect, least of all on newspapermen. Armed with tidbits of fashion gossip and ''always fully fragranced,'' as a former protégée, Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, said, Ms. Donovan could turn a routine meeting into a performance. Yet, as her editors knew, her flamboyance was balanced by a pragmatic streak that for 16 years pleased both readers and advertisers.         These were her best years. She introduced readers to Ms. Karan and Paloma Picasso. She documented the opulence of the 1980's and ushered in the next decade by photographing the trendiest clothes on people in their 90's.         Although in many ways Ms. Donovan was simple in her tastes, preferring plain food and the subway, she was also at home in the upper reaches of fashion and society, a friend to Mr. Lagerfeld as well as the philanthropist Bunny Mellon. While this access improved her insight, it occasionally impaired her objectivity.         At the same time, her more dogmatic assertions often betrayed a deeper need to burn her bridges. She and Bill Blass, a frequent escort, fell out in 1993 when Ms. Donovan excluded him from a published list of 50 people who had influenced fashion in modern times.         In 1997, as if to disprove the dictum  that there are no second acts in American life, Ms. Donovan went to work for Old Navy, playing herself to the hilt. The ads, which brought her financial security, drew on her flamboyant image to promote earthly things like cargo pants.         ''She gave us fashion credibility,'' said Dennis Leggett, the creative director at Old Navy, a division of Gap.         In the final months of her life, Ms. Donovan returned to where her career had begun, The Times. She wrote in its magazine about a little-known designer named Marjan Pejoski, whose feathered-swan dress for the singer Bjork had caused a stir at the Academy Awards. She thought Mr. Pejoski had flair.

         Margaret Byrd Rawson, an educator, researcher and author who spent some 70 years identifying and treating reading disorders, died on Nov. 25 at her home near Frederick, Md. She was 102.         She wrote nine books and many articles on dyslexia and was an early and enduring force in the International Dyslexia Association, a 13,000-member professional group based in Maryland. She was its national president in the 1960's, when it was called the Orton Society. She received the group's lifetime achievement award on her 100th birthday.         Born in Rome, Ga., she was reared in Philadelphia and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore College in 1923. In 1940, she received a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied elementary education and psychology, with emphasis on educational testing and measurements.         In 1929, Mrs. Rawson helped establish the School in Rose Valley, a private school near Philadelphia, and was a librarian, psychologist and teacher until 1947. It was there that she came to the field of dyslexia.         She had been trying in vain to help a boy who had great trouble reading. Frustrated, she enlisted the assistance of Dr. Samuel T. Orton, the neurologist who identified dyslexia and its causes. Dr. Orton tested the child and sent him back with what are known as Orton-Gillingham teaching materials devised to overcome such difficulties. The boy was soon reading at grade level, and Mrs. Rawson had found her niche.         Mrs. Rawson conducted one of the longest-running studies of people with neurological language problems, tracking the lives of 56 children from the school for more than 50 years. Many of them went on to successful careers and stayed in contact with her.         Moving to Frederick in 1947, she taught sociology at Hood College. She also was a clinical psychologist and language consultant and had a private practice diagnosing and correcting language disorders.         Her books included ''A Bibliography on the Nature, Recognition and Treatment of Language Difficulties'' (1966) and ''Developmental Language Disability: Adult Accomplishments of Dyslexic Boys'' (1968).         Mrs. Rawson's husband, Arthur, an engineer, died in 1963. She is survived by a son, Kenneth S., of Swarthmore, Pa.; six grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Rawson was 99 when she testified before the Maryland Department of Education. The hearing, on the teaching of reading, lasted four hours and she was there for the duration.       
         Erica Van Acker, whose experience was the basis of a pioneering public television documentary on rape in 1971 and who became an early public spokeswoman for those who had been raped, died on Sept. 11 in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, N.Y.         Details of her life came to light in research for a biographical sketch.         Ms. Van Acker, who was 30 when she was attacked in the hallway of her apartment building, became pregnant and had an abortion. The documentary, ''No Tears for Rachel,'' was made for Channel 13/ WNET and was broadcast nationally on ''Bill Moyers' Journal.'' After the showing of the documentary, she became an advocate. She would visit hospital emergency rooms to work with doctors to sensitize them to the feelings of those who had been raped.         Mr. Moyers said Ms. Van Acker ''took the chance because she really did want the public to know that rape is a crime where the victim is often made to feel guilty of the crime and to encourage others not to let the imposed sense of shame prevent them from talking to the police or the press.''         The documentary appeared not long before the rape law in New York State was changed to ease the requirement for corroborating evidence to prove a rape. Before the change, legal experts had argued that it was nearly impossible to convict someone of rape, because each aspect of the crime had to be corroborated by evidence other than the victim's testimony.         Though she acted as a child and trained in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, Ms. Van Acker made her career in business. She was involved in training and automation, often working in the early days of office computers to introduce top and middle-level executives to their unwanted desktops. She worked at Ticketron, then at the Off-Track Betting Corporation and at Citibank, before starting her own consulting firm, called VASA, with Gail Soltysik, whom Ms. Van Acker had hired at Citibank.         ''Rape and its aftermath take away any sense of control,'' she said in an article by Erika Duncan about ''No Tears for Rachel'' in 1995. ''But everything that I did afterward was about taking control. Every transition workshop, every seminar I conducted was somehow deeply out of that experience.''         When Ms. Soltysik left the consulting business, she and Ms. Van Acker bought the old train station in Water Mill, on Long Island, and eventually turned it into a restaurant, the Station Bistro. It was known for its food and its all-female staff. Ms. Van Acker planned the menus and did some of the cooking, including soups and her well-known lentil loaf. The restaurant was sold a year and a half ago.         Ms. Van Acker was working as a senior consultant on compensation at Aon Consulting when she died.         Ms. Van Acker was born in Manhattan. Her father was French, her mother English. She moved to England when she was 8. She has no immediate survivors. A memorial service was held Sept. 29 with a reception afterward at her former restaurant, now called Station Road.       
         Louise Steinhart Loeb, a New York benefactor of child welfare agencies and other causes, died Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 86.         Her association with the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services spanned more than four decades. In 1962, as president of its Child Development Center, she guided the center's merger with the Jewish Board of Guardians. She remained on the board of the parent organization at her death.         Louise Steinhart was born in San Francisco and attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. Her husband of 63 years, John A. Loeb, an investment banker and philanthropist, died in 1998.         Mrs. Loeb is survived by 2 daughters, Jean Troubh and Betty Levin, both of Manhattan; 7 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Faith Hubley, a three-time Academy Award winner whose 50 animated films often combined elements of myth, jazz and a deeply felt humanism, died on Friday in New Haven. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         For more than 45 years Ms. Hubley made a film a year, an achievement that Dan McLaughlin, head of the animation workshop at the University of California at Los Angeles, called unbelievable. Her first 21 films were made in partnership with her husband, John, before his death in 1977. Her newest film, ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' came out of the lab just a few days ago; its premiere is to be tomorrow at U.C.L.A., and it is to be shown Jan. 8 at the Museum of Modern Art as part of a celebration of Ms. Hubley's life.         Exploring what she called mythic landscapes, Ms. Hubley used primitive myths, magic and music and, in three classic films, the recorded voices of her four young children to comment on the world as it was, is and should be. A jazz fan who sometimes played the cello in her films, she used the works of Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter and Quincy Jones as background for what has been described as ''filmic poetry.'' Although the visual images of her later films evoke Miró and Klee, Ms. Hubley has described her films as close to cave painting. ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' not quite seven minutes long, paints the deep attachment the Inuit feel toward the earth.         Ms. Hubley once said that the central thread that runs through her impressionistic, dreamlike and often whimsical films is ''human development, with a strong emphasis on the importance of children as people and on the environment people live in.''         When Faith and John Hubley married in 1955 and began making films together, they had only two marriage vows, according to Ms. Hubley. ''One was to eat with the children,'' she said. ''The other was to make one independent film a year.''         The Hubleys kept both promises, and filmmaking became a family affair. They won their first Academy Award in 1959 for ''Moonbird,'' an impressionistic account of young children at play whose unique soundtrack was the recorded voices of their two sons, Mark and Ray. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would not change the name of the category in which they won from ''cartoons'' to ''animated films'' until 1971, but the Hubleys were already expanding cartoons beyond Disney.         Their second Oscar came in 1962, for ''The Hole,'' in which two construction workers debated nuclear destruction. Their third, in 1966, was for the buoyant ''Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature,'' in which the band plays on as more and more people crowd into its automobile.         The Hubleys' work was the subject of a retrospective in 1998 at the Museum of Modern Art.         Until John Hubley's death during heart surgery, Ms. Hubley was considered the lesser partner in their work. When they met, he was already well known. At Disney he had worked as an art director on ''Bambi,'' ''Dumbo,'' ''Pinocchio,'' and ''The Rite of Spring'' episode of ''Fantasia.'' Staunchly pro-union, he had left Disney during a bitter strike in 1941 and then was a founder of United Productions of America, where he helped move animation away from Disney with the creation of ''Mr. Magoo'' and ''Gerald McBoing-Boing.''         Ms. Hubley, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, had bolted from home at the age of 15 without finishing high school. Reticent in interviews about her childhood except to say that her parents had ''made no room for children,'' she created an intimate self-portrait on film in the 25-minute ''My Universe Inside Out'' (1996), which hints at child abuse and her parents' burning down the family house.         At 18, Ms. Hubley went to Hollywood. Because World War II had emptied the studios of young men, she got a job as a messenger at Columbia. She worked her way up to sound-effects editor, music editor and script clerk, and dreamed of being an independent filmmaker.         History gave her a shove in the right direction. Because of John Hubley's political activism, they were blacklisted. Returning to New York, they fed their growing family by working on commercials and educational films. Their first independent film, ''Adventures of an *,'' was finished the year after their marriage, right on schedule.         ''We could have been rich,'' Ms. Hubley recently told a reporter. ''But I told John, 'If you're an artist, you can't be a huckster.' ''         The Hubleys earned an Oscar nomination for ''Windy Day'' in 1968. This time the voices of the children were those of their two daughters, Emily and Georgia. In ''Cockaboody'' (1973), Emily and Georgia played at being grown-up mothers and glancingly mulled the death of their own mother.         When John died, the Hubleys were working on their 21st film, ''The Doonesbury Special.'' Finished by Ms. Hubley, Garry Trudeau and their longtime animator, Bill Littlejohn, the film became their seventh to be nominated for an Oscar.         After her husband's death, Ms. Hubley turned to larger themes and more abstract images. ''Step by Step'' (1979) projects mother love against the impossibility of protecting children in a world of foul water and limited food. ''Seers and Clowns'' (1994), which was animated by Ms. Hubley, both her daughters and Mr. Littlejohn, uses the words of Chief Seattle against metamorphosing images of wisdom and folly.         ''Faith was always timid about doing animation,'' said Mr. Littlejohn, who first worked with Ms. Hubley on the 1962 film ''The Hole.'' ''The strengths of her films were her brilliant designs and her strong ideas. And making one film a year is a standard no one else has approached.''         Ms. Hubley's solo films, usually a combination of her watercolor paintings and cel animation, often dealt in a poetic way with the treatment of women (''Witch Madness,'' 1999) and with pre-Christian myths. ''The Big Bang and Other Creation Myths'' gives no more credence to the scientific explanation of the beginning of the world than it does to half a dozen primitive beliefs.         At the time of her death, Ms. Hubley was a senior critic in the department of art at Yale University. In addition to her four children, she is survived by six grandchildren.         To the end, Ms. Hubley loved being an independent filmmaker. As she told an interviewer a few months ago: ''I am willing to pay the price: total financial anxiety all the time. I don't have any greed illusions. I need to eat, and that's that.''
