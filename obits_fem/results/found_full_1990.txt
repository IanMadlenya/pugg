        Ethel F. Donaghue, one of the first women to practice law in Connecticut, died in her sleep Saturday at her home in West Hartford. She was 93 years old.         Ethel F. Donaghue, one of the first women to practice law in Connecticut, died in her sleep Saturday at her home in West Hartford. She was 93 years old.         Miss Donaghue, a native of Hartford, earned a law degree in 1920 from the University of Pennsylvania and specialized in real-estate and trust law in the Connecticut capital.         A battle over control of her financial affairs, after a series of strokes incapacitated her in 1980, led Probate Judge James H. Kinsella to resign in 1984 to avoid the possibility that he would be the first judge ever impeached by the Connecticut House of Representatives.         Miss Donaghue was one of the state's wealthiest women, having amassed an estate valued in 1978 at $35 million from an inheritance and her earnings.         After her strokes, William W. Graulty, a bank officer who managed her finances, was named her conservator by Judge Kinsella, who also appointed a close friend as co-conservator and his former clerk to oversee them.         Mr. Graulty and the other two had a dispute and another probate judge removed both conservators and accepted the overseer's resignation. In 1983 the state's Probate Council found that Judge Kinsella had acted improperly. A year later, on the day the Connecticut House of Representatives was to vote on impeaching him, Judge Kinsella resigned. The House then voted narrowly to drop the matter.         Miss Donaghue leaves no immediate survivors.       
        Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Ms. Kushner gained national recognition in 1975, when she wrote about her battle with breast cancer in a book, ''Why Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her Life,'' published by W. B. Saunders Company in Philadelphia. She became an influential voice questioning standard medical procedures and was a leader in the movement to change the way the disease is treated.         Many of the steps she advocated, especially less radical surgery, were at first rejected by leading breast cancer experts but are now common practice.         As the founder and director of the Breast Cancer Advisory Center in Kensington, Ms. Kushner provided women with crucial information about their options when facing breast cancer.         'Poetic Justice' in Award         She was a member of the National Breast Cancer Advisory Board from 1980 to 1986 and was appointed last year to the American Cancer Society's Breast Cancer Task Force.         This year, Ms. Kushner will be awarded the Society of Surgical Oncology's James Ewing Award for outstanding contributions by a lay person to the fight against cancer. This is ''poetic justice,'' said her husband, Harvey D. Kushner, because the society's members had ''booed her off their stage in 1975,'' after she had challenged their standard treatments.         ''A lot of people heard about her and trusted her,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, director of the division of cancer treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.         At the time of her death, Ms. Kushner was lobbying to encourage the Federal Government to require that health insurance companies cover mammograms.         A psychologist and medical writer, Ms. Kushner turned single-mindedly to her breast cancer crusade in 1974, when she found a lump in her breast but refused to submit to the then routine ''one step'' procedure.         In the mid-1970's, women would be anesthetized, the lump would be removed for biopsy on the spot and, if it was malignant, the breast would be removed. The patient would learn only upon awakening whether she had lost a breast. Ms. Kushner believed that women needed time after a cancer diagnosis to find the best surgeon to remove the breast.         She railed against the one-step procedure and, after 18 telephone calls, finally found a general surgeon to remove just her lump. She later found a breast cancer specialist to remove her breast when the lump proved cancerous.         Role in Changing Practice         Now, the one-step procedure that Ms. Kushner abhorred is no longer done.         ''She is probably the single most important person in leading to this major change in breast surgery,'' Dr. Chabner said. Although there was medical evidence that the one-step procedure was not advisable, Dr. Chabner added, ''I don't think the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had not been so persistent in her efforts.''         Later, Ms. Kushner became an advocate for increased use of lumpectomy, in which the malignant lump is removed but the rest of the breast is left.         Ms. Kushner was born in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1972.         She is survived by her husband, Harvey; her sons, Gantt of Silver Spring, Md., and Todd of Rockville, Md.; a daughter, Lesley Kushner of San Francisco, and her brothers, Isaac and Meyer Rehert of Baltimore and Paul Rehert of West Palm Beach, Fla.

Jane Yockel, an arts administrator known for her support of avant-garde dance, theater and music, died of a heart attack on Jan. 31. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Yockel was born in Cuba, N.Y., and received degrees in English literature from the University of Indiana and Columbia University. She was the controller of the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 1968 to 1971, when she helped to found Art Services, a management agency whose clients have included John Cage, Joseph Chaikin, Richard Foreman, Philip Glass, Trisha Brown and Lucinda Childs.         Ms. Yockel served on the boards of the Byrd Hoffman Foundation, the Technical Assistance Group and the Wooster Group. At the time of her death, she was a director of Art Services.         She is survived by a sister, Molly Henderson, of Norwood, Mass., and a brother, Judson Moak, of Ocala, Fla.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Greneker was also an architect, contractor, bricklayer and corporation president. She received her architectural and building experience when she drew plans for and built four large stone houses and several small ones in Mount Kisco, N.Y.         Married to Claude P. Greneker, who was for many years publicity director for the Shubert theater interests, she became interested in mannequins when her husband wanted to use some in a theater stunt. To Mrs. Greneker's astonishment, she found that most mannequins were virtual statues and, in 1937, decided to make her own.         She began by forming heads and hands of cellophane and moved on to papier-mache, developing the flexible waist and adding mobility to the mannequins manufactured by the Greneker Corporation. She became president of the company.         The mannequins had carpenter-made joints and rubber ribs, for pliable body parts; horsehair wigs, and theatrical makeup. They appeared in the windows of Fifth Avenue stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.         Mrs. Greneker also created a series of thimble tools - paintbrushes, pencils, screwdrivers and the like - that could be attached to fingertips. They did not catch on.         In World War II, her factory in Pleasantville, N.Y., turned to military work. At the request of the United States Rubber Company, she invented and manufactured forms for self-sealing gasoline tanks for Navy warplanes.         After the war she turned to portrait sculpture, and her heads of actresses were widely exhibited.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving sibling of former President Jimmy Carter, died of pancreatic cancer Monday at Sumter Regional Hospital here. She was 63 years old.  It was in December that Mrs. Spann was found to be suffering from the disease, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister, Ruth Stapleton, and her other brother,         Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving sibling of former President Jimmy Carter, died of pancreatic cancer Monday at Sumter Regional Hospital here. She was 63 years old.  It was in December that Mrs. Spann was found to be suffering from the disease, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister, Ruth Stapleton, and her other brother, Billy.         Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in 1983.         Mrs. Spann was an avid motorcyclist and belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights Organization. In 1977 she collected letters sent by her mother from India, where Lillian Carter served in the Peace Corps, for a book, ''Away From Home: Letters to My Family.'' It was published by Simon & Schuster.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by her husband, Walter, and a son, William.       
        Charlotte M. Sitterly, an astrophysicist whose analysis of sunlight first showed that the element technitium exists in nature, died of heart failure on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91. Dr. Sitterly had devoted much of her career to the study of the sun's spectrum, including wavelengths that could not penetrate the atmosphere and were therefore observed from rockets.         Charlotte M. Sitterly, an astrophysicist whose analysis of sunlight first showed that the element technitium exists in nature, died of heart failure on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91. Dr. Sitterly had devoted much of her career to the study of the sun's spectrum, including wavelengths that could not penetrate the atmosphere and were therefore observed from rockets.         Her principal affiliations were with Princeton University, the National Bureau of Standards, the University of California at Berkeley and the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. She supervised compilation of the multivolume tables of atomic energy levels, as shown by optical spectra, that became a standard reference in laboratories around the world.         She was born Charlotte Emma Moore in Ercildoun, Pa., and was educated at Swarthmore College, where she majored in mathematics and astronomy, graduating in 1920. At Princeton University she worked under Henry Norris Russell, whose classification of stars by brightness and spectral type became standard throughout the world.         In 1925 she began studying the solar spectrum at the Mount Wilson Observatory. She obtained a doctorate in 1931 from the University of California at Berkeley, writing a thesis on the spectra of sunspots. She was appointed to the staff of the Princeton University Observatory. In 1937 she married Dr. Bancroft Walker Sitterly, whom she met there. He is now deceased.         In that year Emilio Segre and his colleagues in Palermo, Italy, identified a substance produced by a particle accelerator at Berkeley as the element predicted to fill a tantalizing gap in the table of elements. From the Greek word for artificial they called it technitium. While all forms, or isotopes, of technitium decay radioactively, that one, technitium 99, lasts thousands of years, allowing the discoverers time to confirm its identity.         Dr. Sitterly then found technitium in the spectrum of sunlight - the first indication that it exists in nature. It has now been found in the light from other stars and is one of the most common products of atom-splitting in nuclear reactors.         In 1945 Dr. Sitterly moved to the National Bureau of Standards in the Department of Commerce to supervise preparation of the now widely used tables of atomic energy levels. In 1961 she was among the first six recipients of the newly created Federal Women's Award for outstanding Government service.         She is survived by several nephews and nieces.

Elizabeth Polk Guest, a patron of classical music in New York and Washington, died of a heart attack on Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 79 years old and lived in Islesboro, Maine, and Front Royal, Va.         Mrs. Guest helped found the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and was chairman of the friends of the center for many years. She was also on the boards of several music schools, opera companies and arts councils, including the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, the Boston Opera Company, the Metropolitan Opera Association, and the School of American Ballet in New York City.         Born in Cedarhurst, L.I., on July 31, 1910, Mrs. Guest was raised in New York City and attended the Juilliard School of Music.         She is survived by her sister, Alice Rutherfurd of Manhattan; two daughters, Elizabeth Guest Stevens of Washington, and Virginia Guest of New York City; a son, Raymond Jr., of Front Royal, Va., and five grandchildren.       
        Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Ms. Capitman, who had lived in Miami since 1973, applied her talents to arouse renewed interest in 1920's and 1930's buildings throughout the country. Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building are among the best examples of Art Deco.         ''My whole life had been Art Deco,'' she once said. ''I was born at the beginning of the period and grew up during the height of it. It's a thing of fate.''         Headed a Preservation League         In 1976 she helped to found the Miami Design Preservation League, which in 1979 won Federal historic designation for the South Beach district of Miami Beach. Her outspoken, unorthodox manner later led to her ouster from the group.         ''She would push and agitate and cause trouble until people wouldn't speak to her,'' said Michael Kinerk, chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival. ''She was interested in results, not social sensitivities.''         The South Beach district is now on the National Register of Historic Places, the only 20th-century district on the register. That status brought Federal tax relief to what had been a depressed area. It is now enjoying an economic and cultural rebirth.         Chapters in Other Towns         Mrs. Capitman, president of the Art Deco Society of America, helped found chapters of the society in several cities, including New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. She was the author of ''Deco Delights'' (1989; E. P. Dutton).         She was born in Chicago and attended New York University. She later wrote advertising copy and was a reporter for The Atlantic City Daily World, which has ceased publication.         Her husband, William Capitman, died in 1975. He was a market researcher and economist and in later years a teacher at Florida International University.         Mrs. Capitman leaves two sons, Andrew W., who lives in London, and John A., who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''         The Legend of Gosta Berling         1924         The Street of Sorrow         1925         Flesh and the Devil         1927         Love         1927         A Woman of Affairs         1929         Anna Christie         1930         Susan Lenox, Her Fall and Rise         1931         Mata Hari         1931         Grand Hotel         1932         As You Desire Me         1932         Queen Christina         1933         The Painted Veil         1934         Anna Karenina         1935         Camille         1936         Conquest         1937         Ninotchka         1939         Two Faced Woman         1942       
        Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, Miss Vaughan influenced countless other singers - including Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade and Rickie Lee Jones - and made hits of such songs as ''It's Magic,'' ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' and ''Broken-Hearted Melody.'' Her ornate renditions of ''Misty'' and ''Send In the Clowns'' were invariable show-stoppers at jazz festivals in recent years, including the JVC Jazz Festival in New York, at which she appeared almost yearly.         Her voice remained remarkably unravaged by time; in her mid-60's, a period when most singers' vocal powers have sharply diminished, she was still close to her peak. Though her speaking voice deepened and darkened in later years, her singing retained a youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre, and she could still project delicate but ringingly high coloratura passages.         Where more idiosyncratic jazz artists like Billie Holiday excelled at interpretation, Miss Vaughan was a contralto who gloried in displaying the distinctive instrumental qualities of a voice that had a comfortable three-octave range and was marked by a voluptuous, heavy vibrato. Known for her dazzling vocal leaps and swoops, she was equally adept at be-bop improvisation and singing theater songs with a symphony orchestra. Among the singers of her generation, only Ella Fitzgerald enjoyed comparable stature.         ''She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,'' the singer Mel Torme said yesterday. ''So much so that I used to call her the diva. At one point, I asked her why she had never opted for an operatic career. She got kind of huffy, and said, 'Do you mean jazz isn't legit?' She was very defensive about being a jazz singer. Where someone like Benny Goodman was able to split his musical image and record Mozart concerts, she wanted to perform precisely where she was.''         Appropriate Nicknames         Throughout her career, Miss Vaughan was affectionately known as Sassy or the Divine Sarah. The first nickname reflected her sense of humor and the mischievous sexiness that often inflected her singing and stage patter. The second, appropriated from the legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt, acknowledged her phenomenonally versatile voice. Foremost among the singers Miss Vaughan admired was the soprano Leontyne Price, to whom she bore more than a passing vocal resemblance.         John S. Wilson, in a New York Times review of a Vaughan performance in 1957, credited the singer with ''what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.''         When Miss Vaughan appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in 1974 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, Mr. Wilson commented on the ''soaring highs and incredibly full lows'' she displayed in her opening numbers and summed up the conclusion of her concert as ''totally virtuosic.''         Sarah Lois Vaughan was born in Newark, on March 27, 1924. Her father was a carpenter and amateur guitarist and her mother a laundress and church vocalist. She studied the piano from the age of 7 and later took up the organ, and at age 12 she became the organist at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, where she was also a soloist in the choir.         Career Began on a Dare         She also enjoyed performing popular tunes at parties, and when friends urged her to enter an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in New York, she took the dare and won first prize in October 1942, singing ''Body and Soul.'' The singer Billy Eckstine heard her perform, and six months after winning the contest she was hired at his recommendation as a second pianist and singer with Earl (Fatha) Hines's big band, in which Mr. Eckstine was a vocalist and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were instrumentalists.         The following year, when Mr. Eckstine formed his own band - which featured Mr. Parker, Mr. Gillespie, Art Blakey and Miles Davis, among other jazz greats - Miss Vaughan went along, and remained with him for a year. After a two-month stint in John Kirby's jazz group in the winter of 1945-46, she began a solo career. Her early solo recordings - on which she performed songs like ''Lover Man'' in full-blown be-bop style, accompanied by Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie -helped establish her reputation as a jazz singer.         First Husband Was Her Manager         During an extended engagement at Cafe Society Downtown in New York City, Miss Vaughan met George Treadwell, a trumpet player, whom she married. He became her manager, and under his guidance she made the transition from jazz cult figure to popular singing star.         She had her first hit in late 1947 with ''Tenderly,'' for the small Musicraft label. The following year, her version of ''It's Magic,'' a song from the movie ''Romance on the High Seas,'' established her as a full-fledged pop star. In 1949, she signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, where she remained until 1954, recording mostly popular songs backed by studio orchestras. Out of more than a dozen hits she had on Columbia, the most successful was ''These Things I Offer You,'' in 1951. Although most of her Columbia hits were disposable pop confections, she also recorded many lasting standards. Columbia recently reissued a collection of 28 songs she recorded between 1949 and 1953.         When Miss Vaughan moved to the Mercury label in 1954, she was given the freedom to pursue a dual career as both a popular and jazz singer. For EmArcy, Mercury's jazz subsidiary, she recorded with Clifford Brown, Cannonball Adderley and members of Count Basie's Orchestra, among other jazz artists. On the parent label, she also scored a steady succession of hits for the rest of the decade.         Songs of Seduction         Two of her biggest successes, ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' (1954) and ''Whatever Lola Wants'' (1955), from the Broadway musical ''Damn Yankees,'' were songs of seduction in which her almost overripe timbre gave an extra edge of sensuality to come-hither messages. Her two other biggest hits were the title song of the Broadway show ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956) and ''Broken-Hearted Melody'' (1959), a ballad with a light rock-and-roll beat. Her complete output for Mercury -263 cuts - was recently reissued.         After 1959, Miss Vaughan would never have any commercially significant pop hits. But over the next 30 years, her reputation as consummate vocal artist soared steadily, thanks to her appearances in nightclubs, at jazz festivals and increasingly with symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad.         During the 1960's, she recorded briefly with Roulette, then again with Mercury and Columbia, and in the 70's and early 80's she made albums for Mainstream and Pablo. It was for Pablo, run by the jazz producer Norman Granz, that she recorded the most critically acclaimed album of her career, ''How Long Has This Been Going On?'' in which she sang with a group that included Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown.         The singer's later recordings ranged from an album of Beatles tunes to a collection of Brazilian pop songs. On CBS's classical crossover recording of ''South Pacific,'' she sang the role of Bloody Mary, and on Quincy Jones's all-star pop-jazz album, ''Back on the Block,'' she and Ella Fitzgerald sang together on a version of Josef Zawinul's ''Birdland.'' In 1982 she won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, for her ''Gershwin Live!'' recording on CBS.         Two Perennial Offerings         Though Miss Vaughan's repertory during her 1980's appearances at the JVC Festival varied from year to year, two songs she would always perform were ''Misty,'' which she had first recorded in 1957 with Mr. Jones, and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which became her musical signature during the last decade of her life.         Living up to her Sassy sobriquet, the singer liked to perform ''Misty'' as a duet with herself, singing the first half in her regular voice, than dipping to the bottom of her contralto to do an amusing imitation of a seductive male lounge singer. ''Send In the Clowns,'' the song that usually closed her shows, became her ultimate vocal showpiece, a three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression. The performances invariably won standing ovations.         Mr. Jones, who first worked with Miss Vaughan in Paris in 1957 when they recorded the original vocal rendition of ''Misty,'' had recently signed her to record a Brazilian fusion album on his label, Qwest. ''Sarah was the most musical singer America has ever known,'' Mr. Jones said yesterday.         Miss Vaughan's marriage to Mr. Treadwell ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Clyde Atkins, a professional football player; Marshall Fisher, a Las Vegas restaurateur, and Waymon Reed, a trumpet player.         She is survived by her mother, Ada, and a daughter, Deborah Vaughan, who uses the first name Paris for her acting career. Both live in Los Angeles.         Miss Vaughan's body will be flown to Newark for a funeral service on Saturday at Mount Zion Baptist Church.

        Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Since Mrs. Hyde was found to have cancer five years ago, she worked ardently to call attention to the disease, raising nearly $2 million for Georgetown University Medical Center, which established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research last year.         In March she organized a benefit at the new Chanel boutique at the Willard Hotel in Washington for which 350 people paid $350 a ticket. The evening raised more than $50,000 for the Nina Hyde Center and an equal amount for Look Good . . . Feel Better, a separate counseling program that helps women after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.         As a reporter, Mrs. Hyde was known for covering fashion as intently as if she were covering a war, searching for the sociological significance of such trends as the development of the punk style in London.         Style of Protest Movement         Her article on that phenomenon helped draw attention at the end of the 1970's to the protest movement among the young. It also helped alert retailers to the London street scene.         She traveled through Europe and the Far East for exhaustive studies of the history of silk and of wool, with her analysis appearing in National Geographic. She was also noted for her ''Ins and Outs'' column on New Year's Day, which covered political and social trends as well as fashion.         She also conducted a lecture series at the Smithsonian Institution, with guests like the designers Issey Miyake, Norma Kamali and Sonia Rykiel.         But she was not averse to offering mundane, sensible advice to women on how to dress. Short skirts look younger than long ones, she believed. Classic shapes are good investments, she said. She advised her readers to buy clothes on sale and at discount. She herself usually wore black dresses and very little makeup.         The daughter of Dr. Harry A. Solomon, an internist, and his wife, Ruth, she was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College. One of two women accepted at the time for New York University's Law School, she dropped out to work for McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, and the Maidenform Brassiere Company. Later she joined Women's Wear Daily as the corset and brassiere editor. In 1961, after marrying Lloyd Hyde, a real estate developer, she moved to Washington where she wrote a column, ''Hyde & Chic,'' for The Washington Daily News. After that newspaper's demise she joined The Washington Post, in 1972.         Celebrities Honor Writer         In 1986, when the Fashion Group decided to honor her at a formal dinner raising money for the group's' scholarship fund, she insisted that some proceeds go toward AIDS research. More than 800 people paid $150 to attend, including fashion designers like Bill Blass, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren from New York, Carla Fendi and Rosita Missoni from Italy and Jacqueline de Ribes and Thierry Mugler from Paris.         Fashion designers have been major contributors to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Mr. Lauren was host at a cocktail party two years ago and donated $100,000 to get the fund started. Other supporters include Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix and Yves Saint Laurent and the Chanel company.         Mrs. Hyde received the Eugenia Sheppard Award for outstanding fashion reporting by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1988 and she was made a Chevalier des Artes et Lettres in Paris last October.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Washington, and Andrea, of San Francisco; her mother, Ruth Solomon of New York; a brother, Howard Solomon of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Marquise Sue de Brantes, of St. Armand Lepypre, France.         The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. Monday at the Washington Hebrew Congregation at Macomb Street and Massachusetts Avenue.       
        Cecil Johnson Roberts, a patron of the arts and a colorful liberal in conservative Alabama, died yesterday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., after suffering an embolism. She was 76 years old.         Cecil Johnson Roberts, a patron of the arts and a colorful liberal in conservative Alabama, died yesterday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., after suffering an embolism. She was 76 years old.         Mrs. Roberts, a transplanted Englishwoman married to a member of one of the city's leading families, became the cultural leader of Birmingham after World War II. She revived the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and helped found the the Birmingham Civic Theater, which later became the University of Alabama-Birmingham Town and Gown Theater. She was the president for the theater for 30 years.         In the mid-1960's she helped integrate the audience for the performing arts in Alabama when she and her husband escorted the city's most visible civil rights leader, Dr. John Nixon, and his wife, Ethel, down the aisle before a performance at the Municipal Auditorium.         Mrs. Roberts and a friend, James Hatcher, founded the Alabama State Council on the Arts and Humanities in 1966, and she won appointment from Gov. George C. Wallace as chairman in 1971.  She took an active interest in Democratic Party politics and advocated voting rights for blacks in Alabama.         She is survived by her husband, David Roberts 3d; two sons, David Roberts 4th and Robin Watson Roberts, both of Birmingham; two brothers, three sisters and two grandchildren.       
        Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         ''She first came to see me at the beach about 15 years ago when my kids were little,'' Ralph Lauren recalled. ''She was a very sparkly girl, and her pictures were great. The ones she did of my family are hanging in my office today.''         When she was starting as a photographer, after studying at Pratt Institute, Mrs. Walz heard Jill Krementz in a lecture at New York University tell how she had decided to concentrate on photographing authors.         ''She then decided to specialize in fashion,'' Miss Krementz said. ''I guess I was her mentor. She turned out to be not only a superb technician, but a woman of wit and wisdom, a photographer with a warm generous heart.''         The Entertaining Insight         In the introduction to her first book, ''The Fashion Makers,'' published in 1978, when designers were achieving the star status of athletes and entertainers, Mrs. Walz described her approach. ''I always tried to bring out some part of their personality for the public to see,'' she wrote. ''I found a magic in the designers I photographed. I also became aware that the public was reaching to them on a new level and they had become celebrities.''         She photographed her subjects in bathtubs, gymnasiums, dental offices and beauty parlors to capture the entertaining insight into their personalities. For a study of Elsa Peretti, Mrs. Waltz went to Spain and photographed the designer in her pool. Despite having lost a leg to cancer when she was 15, Mrs. Walz climbed a 12-foot ladder to find the right angle.         Not all of her subjects were in the fashion field. ''Starring Mothers,'' about well-known mothers and their children, was published in 1987, after her own two daughters had been born. Mrs. Walz's subjects included Diane Feinstein, Patti Labelle, Sally Quinn and Carly Simon. It was considered one of the best photographic books of the year and was included in a group show by the International Center of Photography.         Her subjects for 15 cover stories for The New York Times Magazine included E. L. Doctorow, Joseph Papp and Stephen Sondheim. Her photographs also appeared in GQ, Metropolitan Home, Parade, Rolling Stone and Town & Country.         Surviving are her husband, a furniture and interior designer, their children, Jersey, and Addison, and her parents, Stanley and Pauline Turner, of Toms River, N.J.       
        Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her stepson, John French Jr., said she had suffered a stroke while visiting relatives in the Philadelphia area.         Mrs. French was born into Philadelphia's Main Line society but spent most of her adult life in New York, where she was active in political causes and civic affairs. Although she had not held party office in the last decade, she remained influential in Democratic affairs until her death.         Last year Mrs. French devoted much of her energy to securing revision of the New York City Charter. As chairwoman of the charter committee of the Women's City Club, she lobbied for the changes that were adopted by the voters last November.         Helped Nazi Victims         Earlier this year the Unitarian Universalist Services Committee honored Mrs. French for her work in the aftermath of World War II, when she directed two rest homes in France operated by the church organization for survivors of Nazi concentration camps.         Mrs. French was most prominently in the public eye in 1964 when she tried unsuccessfully to wrest a seat in the House of Representatives from John V. Lindsay. As the Democratic-Liberal candidate in the ''Silk Stocking'' district on Manhattan's East Side, she waged a vigorous campaign but lost, receiving less than 25 percent of the vote.         Two years earlier she had been appointed New York City's first Commissioner to the United Nations, a post she held until her race for Congress.         Mrs. French was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions, from 1964 through 1980, and was vice chairwoman of the state party from 1957 to 1960.         She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which she found progressive. But at 14, as the president of her class, she complained to the headmistress that because the school was all white she was not being prepared for the world in which she was going to live. She quoted the reply: ''My dear Ellie, we're not giving you the opportunity to make friends with Democrats either.''         A Stint as a Teacher         Mrs. French, who later became a member of the New York City Commission on Intergroup Relations, now the Commission on Human Rights, studied at the Sorbonne and at Harvard and Columbia.         In 1932, after her father, Herbert Lincoln Clark, a stockbroker, lost a fortune in the Depression, she returned to Shipley as a teacher and later became a supervisor at the Episcopal School in Overbrook, Pa.         In World War II she served in the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington. In 1949, after returning from France, she joined the staff of The New York Times and was named women's news editor. She resigned in 1955 to become more active in politics, and the following year she ran for the State Senate but lost. In 1957 she was appointed vice chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee to fill a vacancy, and in 1958 she won election to the post.         But two years later, in a split with the party's top leadership, she was out, charging that she and other women had not been given a real voice in Democratic affairs in the state.         Family members said yesterday that last Thursday Mrs. French had been pleased to stand in line for two hours for the chance to meet Nelson Mandela during his New York visit.         Mrs. French's husband, John, whom she married in 1950, died in 1984. Surviving are two stepsons, John Jr., of Manhattan, and Roberts, of Amherst, Mass., and a stepdaughter, Mary Moore of Cheyenne, Wyo.         A funeral service will be held on Monday at 11 A.M. at All Souls Unitarian Church, Lexington Aveue at 80th Street.       
        Barbara Baxley, a stage, film and television actress, was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment. The medical examiner's office said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. She was 63 years old.         Barbara Baxley, a stage, film and television actress, was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment. The medical examiner's office said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. She was 63 years old.         Since her 1948 Broadway debut as a baffled bride in a revival of Noel Coward's ''Private Lives,'' starring Tallulah Bankhead and Donald Cook, Miss Baxley played a wide variety of roles in productions that ranged from Shakespeare to musical comedies.         In 1960 she played a different bride, this one from Texas, in the Tennessee Williams play ''Period of Adjustment,'' for which she received a Tony nomination.         She also won critical praise as Sally Field's mother in the 1979 film ''Norma Rae'' and again in 1981 as a business executive in Wendy Wasserstein's play ''Isn't It Romantic.'' In his review of ''Isn't It Romantic,'' Mel Gussow of The New York Times cited Miss Baxley's ''stylish personification of boardroom urbanity.''         Other Broadway Credits         Miss Baxley's other Broadway credits include ''Whodunnit'' (1983), ''The Three Sisters'' (1964), ''She Loves Me'' (1963), ''The Flowering Peach'' (1954), ''The Frogs of Spring'' (1953), ''Camino Real'' (1953) and ''Out West of Eighth'' (1951).         Early in her career, she filled in for Jean Arthur in ''Peter Pan'' and took over Julie Harris's role in ''I Am a Camera.''         Off Broadway, she sang Brecht-Weill songs in ''Brecht on Brecht'' (1962) and appeared in ''To Be Young, Gifted and Black'' (1969).         She played Isabel in ''Measure for Measure,'' a New York Shakespeare Festival production in Central Park in 1966, and Portia in ''The Merchant of Venice'' at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., in 1967. At the Yale Repertory Theater she had the title roles in ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' and ''Major Barbara.''         She starred in the national companies of ''Zorba,'' ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' and the Kennedy Center Bicentennial production of ''Scarecrow.'' In Chicago she co-starred with George Grizzard in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and Moliere's ''Misanthrope.''         Miss Baxley's films included ''Nashville'' (1975), ''Countdown'' (1968), ''No Way to Treat a Lady'' (1968), ''All Fall Down'' (1962) and ''The Savage Eye'' (1960).         As Television Guest         Her many guest appearances on television included ''Murder, She Wrote,'' ''Hawaii Five-O,'' ''The Hitchcock Hour,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90.'' In the Norman Lear series ''All That Glitters,'' she played the industrialist L. W. Carruthers.         Miss Baxley, born in Stockton, Calif., graduated with honors in speech and history from the College of the Pacific in Stockton and won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, where she studied with Sanford Meisner. She was also a charter member of the Actors Studio, where she studied with Elia Kazan.         Miss Baxley received honors including the Actors Studio Award for achievement in 1980.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.

She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker in ''Hello, Dolly!'' which she played on Broadway for two years.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Richard M. Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.' ''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in nightclubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Hello, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Funeral arrangements had not been made yesterday, but Miss Bailey's road manager, E. B. Smith, said she would be buried in Philadelphia, next to family members.       
        Mary Shaw Shorb, a microbiologist whose research led to the discovery of vitamin B12 in 1947, died Saturday at Greater Laurel-Beltsville Hospital in Maryland.         Mary Shaw Shorb, a microbiologist whose research led to the discovery of vitamin B12 in 1947, died Saturday at Greater Laurel-Beltsville Hospital in Maryland.         She was 83 years old and lived in Beltsville. The hospital said she died of a kidney ailment.         Dr. Shorb, a research professor emerita of poultry husbandry at the University of Maryland, was working at the Maryland Agricultural Experimental Station in the mid-1940's in search of a microorganism that would be useful in treating pernicious anemia, a disease that was fatal until the 1920's, when a liver extract was developed to treat it.         Bacterium Discovered         Since the extract had to be injected in a costly and painful process, scientists sought an alternative. Dr. Shorb found a bacterium, Lactobacillus lactis Dorner, that was present in tomato juice and liver extract, making possible the creation of the vitamin.         Securing an unpaid research position at the University of Maryland, she worked with scientists of Merck & Company to develop the substance that was marketed as vitamin B12.         In 1949 she was made a research professor at the university, a post she held until she retired in 1972.         Dr. Shorb, a native of Wahpeton, N.D., held a bachelor's degree from the College of Idaho and a doctorate in immunology from Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, where she was a researcher from 1929 to 1932.         After taking time off to raise a family, she returned to research in 1942 with the Agriculture Department's Bureau of Human Nutrition and later with the Dairy Industry Bureau. In 1946 she was given the research position at the University of Maryland.         Dr. Shorb is survived by her husband, Doyf; a son, Alan, who lives in Japan; two daughters, Carole Shorb and Barbara Breeden, both of Beltsville; a sister, Margaret Brownfield of Boise, Idaho; seven grandchldren, and 14 great-grandchildren.       
        Irene Dunne had a ladylike gentility that made her naughty antics in sophisticated comedies all the more hilarious. In classic farces like ''The Awful Truth,'' in which she portrayed a worldly divorcee briefly inpersonating a gauche chorine, she delighted audiences and reviewers with her wit and elan.         Critics agreed that her artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. Miss Dunne was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and longtime popularity, an Oscar eluded her.         Colleagues regarded her as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., once a co-star, wrote that she was ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         Studied Music         Of Irish descent, Irene Dunne was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec 20. The year was 1904, according to most sources. Her father was a supervisory steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, an accomplished pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended a convent school, studied voice and piano with private teachers, sang in a church choir, attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and, after winning an arduous contest, was given a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors.         After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected for being, Miss Dunne recalled, ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in a number of minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, a milestone year, she was cast in the leading role of Magnolia for what became a hugely successful 72-week tour of Florenz Ziegfeld's production of ''Show Boat.''         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after a minor picture called ''Leathernecking'' and six months of drama lessons, she won the leading role of Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.''         Miss Dunne was cast for several years in such tragic and lachrymose roles as a hanidcapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a hugely popular tearjerker; a troubled wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she challenged a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 30's         By the mid-30's, her rich, warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline,'' the sparkling ''Roberta,'' ''Show Boat,'' and ''High, Wide and Handsome.''         Miss Dunne chose her vehicles with great care and won even greater popularity in effervescent and urbane madcap comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a daring book and tries to live up to it.In several other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying backtalk.         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her personal favorite of her 41 films.         The actress later received accolades for two major wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was the indestructible Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's King in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family in early 20th-century San Francisco in ''I Remember Mama.''         Active in Philanthropies         Miss Dunne was miscast in her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by the makeup she wore to play a frumpy elderly Queen Victoria. Her final film was ''It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952. In the 50's, she made occasional television appearances.         As her acting career became less demanding, Miss Dunne found other pursuits, away from the film industry. An active Republican, she was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairman of many philanthropies.         Miss Dunne was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter, Mary Frances.       
        Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Mrs. Sigmund first learned that she had cancer in 1982, when a melanoma was found behind her left eye. The eye was removed and she continued with her political career.         But last year, after Mrs. Sigmund unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, doctors found that the cancer had spread. Mrs. Sigmund had finished second in the primary to Representative Jim Florio, who went on to win the general election.         Born in New Orleans         Politics and public service were a way of life for Barbara Boggs Sigmund. She was born on May 27, 1939, in New Orleans about the time that her father, Hale Boggs, was beginning his first term as a Democratic Congressman.         In 1972, the plane carrying her father, then the House majority leader, was lost over Alaska, and her mother, Corinne Lindy Claiborne Boggs, succeeded him in Congress.         Mrs. Sigmund's mother's family, the Claibornes, traced its roots to colonial Jamestown in Virginia and is said to have included more members of Congress than any other American family.         Politics 'All Around Us'         ''Nobody speechified about it,'' Mrs. Sigmund once said about the family's deep interest in politics. ''It was all around us.''         Her brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, is a prominent lawyer in Washington, and her sister, Cokie Roberts of Bethesda, Md., is a correspondent for National Public Radio and for ABC News on television and radio.         Mrs. Sigmund was a graduate of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. She married Paul E. Sigmund, a professor of political science at Princeton, in 1964. She became a Latin teacher at the Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Princeton. After the birth of the couple's three sons, she returned to the school to teach religion and government.         In 1974, she left Stuart to join the staff of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University.         After serving as a member of the Princeton Borough Council, she was elected in 1976 to the Mercer County Board of Freeholders. She was president of the board in 1979 and 1980.         In 1982, she decided to run for Congress, hoping she could join her mother on Capitol Hill. But at the last minute she changed her mind and ran instead for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, finishing fourth in a field of 10 candidates. It was during the 1982 campaign that she lost her eye to cancer and surprised everyone by showing up at a fund-raising event hours after checking out of the hospital. She was wearing an eye patch covered with the words ''Vote Sigmund.''         'Subject to the Fates'         After her defeat in the Senate primary, she was elected mayor of Princeton in 1983. ''There's no way to plan a political life,'' she said at the time. ''It's all subject to the fates. I enjoy practicing the craft of government and I think it can be done from the local level up, as well as the other way.''         She brought a ready wit and seemingly boundless energy to the job of Mayor and attacked the problems of providing affordable housing and managing development. She loved to point out that Princeton's image as a wealthy town was misleading. ''It has been a town of mixed-income groups and races for centuries,'' she said.         Once, she complained wryly that most of the town's newer residents were executives in the high-tech industries that were moving to Princeton and surrounding areas. ''We want a certain amount,'' she said, ''but not so much as to destroy the town.''         Writing Poetry         After Mrs. Sigmund was found to have a recurrence of cancer last year, she began chemotherapy treatments but continued to devote as much energy as she could to the duties of her office and her favorite hobby, writing poetry.         Her mother announced in July that she would not run for re-election to Congress. She did not say so at the time, but close associates said she wanted more time to spend with her daughter.         Besides her husband, her mother, her brother and her sister, Mrs. Sigmund is survived by three sons, Paul Jr., of Ann Arbor, Mich., David, of Detroit, and Stephen, of New Orleans.         A funeral service will be held on Saturday at 5:30 P.M. in the Princeton University Chapel.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Ann Cole Phillips, a painter, died in New York Hospital on Friday night. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia after a long illness, her son, Calman, said.         Ms. Phillips's colorful, vivacious paintings in a semi-abstract style are found in a number of museum collections.         In a tribute to her work, Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1986 established the Ann Cole Phillips Room, a classroom, where students can study the artist's experience from her paintings on the walls around them.         At the height of her career in the 1950's and 1960's, Ms. Phillips's works were compared to Kandinsky, Dufy and Kokoschka. She worked in oils, pastels and lithography.         A native New Yorker, she attended the National Academy of Design and the Arts Students League. She also studied with such masters as Stuart Davis, Jacques Villon and Jose Clemente Orozco.         Besides her son, she is survived by a brother, George Columbus of Lake Worth, Fla., and a granddaughter, Jamey Phillips of New York City.
