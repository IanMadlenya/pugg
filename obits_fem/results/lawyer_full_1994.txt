         Katherine Kuh, a writer on art and a former curator at the Art Institute of Chicago who devoted her career to the acceptance of modern art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died of natural causes, said her lawyer, William H. Roth.         Mrs. Kuh, the former Katherine Woolf, was born in St. Louis in 1904. She attended Vassar College and decided to focus on art history after taking a course taught by Alfred H. Barr Jr., soon to become the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art.         After graduate work at the University of Chicago and New York University, she opened Chicago's first commercial gallery of avant-garde art in 1936. For the next six years, she exhibited works by an impressive list of European and American modernists, including Leger, Kandinsky, Picasso and Klee, as well as African and pre-Columbian art, typographical design and photography. Sales were rare, so Mrs. Kuh kept the gallery afloat by holding art-history classes there. Innovative Exhibitions         In 1943, she was hired by Daniel Catton Rich, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, to run the museum's public-relations office while its regular director served in the military. She was soon put in charge of the museum's Gallery of Art Interpretation, where she mounted innovative exhibitions that introduced the public to modern art by comparing it to examples of art from other periods.         As associate curator of painting and sculpture at the institute, Mrs. Kuh worked with Rich to organize the first public exhibition of the great modern art collection of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Arensberg in 1949. In 1951, she published her first book, "Art Has Many Faces," one of the first books on the appreciation of modern art, and it was widely used by teachers.         In 1954, she became the Art Institute's first curator of modern painting and sculpture and, with Rich, was responsible for acquiring many of its most important works in this area, including Matisse's monumental figure painting "Bathers by a River."         In 1959, a year after Rich's departure, Mrs. Kuh left the Art Institute; soon she moved to New York. Over the next decade, she worked as art adviser for the First National Bank of Chicago, assembling an eclectic corporate collection of some 2,000 works that is considered one of the best in the country. During this period, her books included "The Artist's Voice" (1962), "Break-Up: The Core of Modern Art" (1965) and "The Open Eye: In Pursuit of Art" (1971).         Her marriage, to George Kuh, ended in divorce.       
         May Nora Shea, a volunteer worker and supporter of diverse causes, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai South Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was a respiratory ailment, her family said.         Mrs. Shea was a native of Brooklyn and attended Trinity College in Washington. In 1937 she married William A. Shea, a New York lawyer who became a partner in Shea & Gould, founded the Mets baseball team and for whom Shea Stadium is named. Mr. Shea died in 1991 after 54 years of marriage.         Mrs. Shea, known to her family and friends as Nori, was involved in such causes as the National Center for Disability Services, the Foundation for Children with Learning Disabilities, Catholic Charities, Little League Baseball and the American Ireland Fund. She was a member of the board of the Georgetown University Law Center.         Mrs. Shea is survived by a son, William A. Jr. of Manhattan; two daughters, Kathy Shea Anfuso of Portland, Ore., and Patricia Shea Ryan of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Rose Nussbaum Justin, a lawyer who held legal positions in New York City government, died on Jan. 17 at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 83 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was heart disease, said her daughter, Gail Justin.         After graduating from St. John's University Law School in 1932, Mrs. Justin was the chief counsel for the Bronx Legal Aid Society, an agent for the city's Investigation Division, a Civil Service examiner, a lawyer for the City Rent Commission and a referee in Small Claims Court. She was an administrative law judge for the Parking Violations Bureau for almost 20 years, starting in 1973. At various times she practiced law in Manhattan with her husband, David Justin, who died in 1982.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, Paul, both of Manhattan.       
         Rebecca Pollard Van Lennep Guggenheim Logan, a philanthropist and patron of the arts who was for a generation one of the best-known social hostesses in Washington, died on Friday at her home in Washington. She was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Leonard L. Silverstein, her lawyer.         For 21 years she was married to Col. M. Robert Guggenheim, an heir to a copper fortune, who died in 1959. Their 55-room residence, Firenze House, is one of Washington's great estates, set on 22 acres in the northwestern section of the city.         From the 1940's to the 1970's Firenze House was the setting for social functions attended by Presidents, Government officials, diplomats and business executives. It was also used for charity fund-raising events.         Mrs. Logan was active in committees aiding the National Society of Arts and Letters, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the National Symphony and the Opera Society of Washington.         She studied art in New York and graduated from the school at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. While there, she met and in 1926 married a Harvard student, Dr. William B. Van Lennep Jr. They divorced in 1937.         The next year she married Colonel Guggenheim , who was United States Ambassador to Portugal in 1953 and 1954, aboard his 175-foot yacht.         After Colonel Guggenheim died, she married John A. Logan in 1962. Mr. Logan, a management consultant in Washington, died in 1986.         She is survived by a son, Richard Van Lennep of Washington; a nephew, Randolph M. Pollard of Las Vegas, Nev., and a niece, Beverly Page of Bow, N.H.       
         Sayra Fischer Lebenthal, a Wall Street legend who was a co-founder in 1925 of the investment-banking firm of Lebenthal & Company and remained active in it for 67 years, died on Thursday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lebenthal was a newlywed when she and her husband, Louis S. Lebenthal, set up shop in a tiny office with second-hand furniture and no rugs. They sought their niche as bond traders and found it.         Bonds had been around since Colonial times, when they were used to finance militias, but in 1925 they were still considered an investment for millionaires. The new firm spotted an opening that had been missed by others: they looked for odd lots of small-denomination bonds from estates and other neglected sources and offered them to relatively modest savers.         The company thrived, continuing to do so after the death of Louis Lebenthal in 1951. Mrs. Lebenthal, grieving, decided to stay in business. She specialized in tax-exempt municipal bonds for small investors, and watched the market for them soar.         For years, she put in full workweeks checking the day's municipal offerings and dealing with clients by telephone until, at 92, a fall put her in failing health. She had already begun to delegate management control in thge 1980's and disposed of her majority holding in the firm about four years ago.         A native of Keyport, N.J., she graduated from Syracuse University Law School and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1923. Set to practice law, she married Mr. Lebenthal in 1925 and he persuaded her to go into a partnership as bond traders.         Mrs. Lebenthal was remarried in 1956 to I. Arnold Ross, a lawyer and former State Assemblyman. He died in 1981. She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Lebenthal Bissinger of Manhattan; a son, Jim Lebenthal, the firm's chairman and spokesman, also of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Natalie Hall Rowe, a musical-comedy star and opera singer in New York and London in the 1920's and 30's, died last Friday at her home in Edgecomb, Me. She was 89.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Betty Gruendel of Edgecomb.         As Natalie Hall, she made her Broadway debut in the chorus of "Iolanthe" in 1926. A lyric soprano, she then played a variety of roles with the American Opera Company from 1928 to 1930, including Marguerite in "Faust" and the leads in "Carmen" and "Yolanda in Cyprus."         She appeared with her sister, Bettina, in "Three Little Girls" in 1931. The next year, she had roles in "Through the Years" and "Music in the Air."         Miss Hall won critical acclaim for her performance as the lead in "The Merry Widow" in Central City, Colo., in 1933. Later that year, she went to London to star in the West End production of "Ball at the Savoy." Returning to New York, she played in "Music Hath Charms," "Otello" and "Nights of Song" and in a production of "Showboat" on Randalls Island in 1938.         In the 1940's she lived in Hamilton, N.Y., where her husband, Edward C. Rowe, was a lawyer at Colgate University. In 1964 the couple moved to Maine, where Miss Hall appeared in many productions at the Brunswick Music Theater. Mr. Rowe died in 1974.         Miss Hall was born in Warwick, R.I.         She is survived by her daughter and a sister, Bettina Rubicam of Scottsdale, Ariz.       
         Shirley Ann Dungan Kheel, a lawyer and civic worker, died yesterday at her Manhattan home. She was 49.         Mrs. Kheel died of cancer, said her husband, Robert.         Her son David was the first child to be born in New York after conception by laboratory methods.         Mrs. Kheel was active in the Trinity and Collegiate schools in Manhattan, the Urban League and the Howard and Georgeanna Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine. She was a graduate of the University of Rochester and received a law degree from Yeshiva University.         She is survived by her husband and sons, Daniel and David, all of Manhattan; her father, James O. Dungan of Rochester; two sisters, Laura Dungan of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Dr. Bonnie Dungan of Philadelphia, and two brothers, James Dungan of Binghamton, N.Y., and Kelly Dungan of Rochester. Her father-in-law is Theodore Kheel, the labor mediator and lawyer, of Manhattan.       
         Julie Noel Gilbert, 48, who spent her 20-year professional career as a lawyer in Washington, became a partner in Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in 1985 after its merger with the tax firm of Cohen & Uretz, where she had practiced previously.         Much of Ms. Gilbert's practice involved such nonprofit organizations as museums, universities, pension funds, foundations, hospitals and historic preservation groups. Her charitable legal activities included legal work for Second Harvest, a national network of food banks and food kitchens that supplied meals to the needy.         Ms. Gilbert was a tax specialist in the Washington office of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, one of the nation's oldest and largest law firms, with headquarters in Philadelphia. She concentrated on tax controversy and appellate work, as well as administrative and legislative matters.         In 1973 Ms. Gilbert and several other colleagues at the firm founded a women's luncheon discussion group dealing with taxation.  Doctorate From HarvardMet as Legal Adversaries         She taught in many seminars and courses sponsored by the American Bar Association, the American Law Institute, the Brookings Institution, the American Association of Museums and the American Council on Education.         She graduated in 1967 from Newton College of the Sacred Heart, which later merged with Boston College. She received a master's degree from the University of Virginia in 1968 and, in 1971, a doctorate in law from Harvard University.         She is survived by a brother, Joseph Gilbert of Bridgeport, Conn., and two stepchildren, Alex J. and Maggie K. Trias of Washington.       
         Jolene R. Marion, a New York lawyer who played a prominent role in the animal-rights movement, died on Sunday at the Queens home of a friend, Marilyn Mason. She was 53 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         At her death, she was an adjunct professor at the Pace University School of Law. She also continued to represent clients.         A native of Brooklyn, Ms. Marion began her animal-rescue work while an undergraduate at Queens College in 1970. She graduated from Seton Hall Law School in 1976 and became an insistent voice among advocates of animal-rights laws to ban leghold traps and other cruel practices.         She was associated with a number of organizations, including the Animal Legal Defense Fund and Legal Action for Animals. Much of her work was pro bono, with clients ranging from individual pet owners to humane organizations.         She is survived by her sister, Helena Pittman of Huntington, L.I.       
         Lois G. Forer, an author, a retired Philadelphia judge and a lifelong advocate for the young, the elderly and the poor, died on Monday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. A Philadelphia resident, she was 80.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         Judge Forer, an authority on criminal justice, spent 32 years practicing law and 16 years on the bench. Her books on the law received critical acclaim nationally.         She also headed a poverty law office for children, sat on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union and represented poor people in constitutional cases. As a private lawyer, she worked for wealthy clients and corporations, and as a judge she tried both criminal and civil cases. Benchmark Cases         From 1955 to 1966, she served Pennsylvania as Deputy Attorney General and played a key role in two benchmark cases. One of them ended the whites-only policy that the founder of Girard College had written into his will. The other opened the celebrated art collection of the tax-exempt Barnes Foundation to the public.         She became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia in 1971 and retired as a senior judge in 1987.         Lois Goldstein Forer was born in Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University in 1935. She worked briefly as a reporter and then as a union organizer. Dissatisfied, she returned to Northwestern for a law degree and spent several years in public service in Washington before moving to Philadelphia as a law clerk in Federal Court.         After her stint as Deputy Attorney General in 1966, she organized the Office for Juveniles at Community Legal Services and headed it for nearly two years.         Judge Forer received national attention with her first book, "No One Will Lissen: How Our Legal System Brutalizes the Youthful Poor" (1970). In it, she argued that the humane ideal to treat juveniles differently had been mangled in practice. For the most part, she wrote, juveniles falling into the system are poor, nonwhite and defenseless.         Her "Criminals and Victims: A Trial Judge Reflects on Crime and Punishment" (1980) tried to make sense of seeking to mete out justice in an environment of abstract theories of the way things are supposed to be. A judge, she asserted, finds little in the way of either practical guidance or spiritual comfort from abstractions.) Critical Views on Justice         "Money and Justice: Who Owns the Courts?" (1984) describes a system that costs too much and takes too long and often results in "substantial injustice." "A Chilling Effect: The Mounting Threat of Libel and Invasion of Privacy Actions to the First Amendment" (1987) argued for definitions of what is libelous and what is newsworthy. Federal legislation to that end would help rid the First Amendment of the ballast a litigious society has heaped on it, she contended.         Since her fourth-stage lymphoma was diagnosed eight months ago, Judge Forer finished two more books. One, "What Every Woman Should Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money," is scheduled for publication by MacMillan later this year.         Her highly topical last book, "The Rage to Punish: The Unintended Consequences of Mandatory Sentencing," is on W. W. Norton's list for next month.         Judge Forer is survived by her husband, Morris L. Forer; two sons, Stuart, of Warwick, R.I., and John, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Hope Forer Ross of Manhattan; a sister, Marion Schott of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and two grandsons.         Correction:  May 14, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Wednesday about Lois G. Forer, author and retired Philadelphia judge, referred incorrectly to the publication of her book "What Every Woman Needs to Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money." The publication, by Macmillan, is not due later this year; it occurred in February.       
         Catherine Damon Christy, a former president of the Young Women's Christian Association of Brooklyn and a former member of the boards of various charitable organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 96 and formerly lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was cardiac arrest. She had been suffering from arteriosclerotic heart disease, said Joseph Pagliaro of the Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, Conn.         Mrs. Christy did volunteer work for years with the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. and was its president from 1944 to 1953. She was also a longtime member of its board.         In addition, she was a member of the national Y.W.C.A. board from 1947 to 1967 and was variously a member of its executive committee, its committee on racial inclusiveness and other panels.         Mrs. Christy also served on the boards of the Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service, and was secretary of the National United Service Organization from 1957 to 1968.         A native of Pulaski, Va., she received a Bachelor of Science degree from Simmons College in Boston in 1920 and was later employed as a librarian.         She married Francis T. Christy, a lawyer, in 1922. He died in 1979.         She is survived by two sons, Arthur H. of Manhattan and Dr. Francis T. Christy of Washington; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Flora Tobin Bryant, a wedding and party planner who also wrote about both subjects, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Bridgeport. She was 84 and lived in Fairfield, Conn.         The cause was a heart attack, said her lawyer, Richard J. Fricke.         Mrs. Bryant was born in New York, graduated from the Spence School, and in 1941 was a vice chairman of the committee that formed the United Service Organizations, the coalition of groups assisting American military personnel.         Mrs. Bryant began to plan weddings in 1948. In 1956, after her marriage to Lieut. Col. Kendall S. Bryant, the couple founded the Bryant Bureau, a Weston, Conn., business that helped families arrange weddings Colonel Bryant died in 1979 and she sold the business in 1989.         Mrs. Bryant wrote a novel, "No Gloves for the Groom," under the pseudonym Peregrine Pace. With her husband she also wrote, "It's Your Wedding," a guide to planning weddings.       
         Margie Pitts Hames, an Atlanta civil rights lawyer who argued a companion case to the better-known Roe v. Wade, in which the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right to have an abortion, died on Tuesday night while driving her car in Atlanta. She was 60.         According to the police there, she suffered a heart attack, and her car went off the road and into a parking lot. She was pronounced dead at Piedmont Hospital a short while later.         Ms. Hames argued Doe v. Bolton, a suit from Georgia concerning restrictions on sites where abortions could be performed, which ran parallel to Roe v. Wade, a Texas case. The Supreme Court ruled on the two cases on Jan. 22, 1973. Ms. Hames called the decision "a cornerstone for liberating women."         Born in Milton, Tenn., she was a legal secretary when she started studying law at Middle Tennessee State University. She transferred to Vanderbilt University, where she earned bachelor's and law degrees.         She started practicing law in 1962, specializing in labor-management relations. She ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia Supreme Court 12 years ago.         Ms. Hames and several other Atlanta lawyers put the Doe v. Bolton case together in 1970 as a constitutional challenge to Georgia's abortion law. "Doe," like "Roe," was a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who had been unable to get a legal abortion. Ms. Hames was the main lawyer in the case when it came before the United States Supreme Court.         She was less successful in another instance as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. A lawsuit filed in 1972 sought to end persistent segregation in the Atlanta schools by busing pupils across city, county and district lines in a six-county region. The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that there was no basis for ordering such a sweeping busing plan.         Ms. Hames's survivors include a son, Adam, and a daughter, Donia.       
         Zelma Watson George, a sociologist, musicologist and performer who broke a color barrier on Broadway in 1950, died on Sunday at University Hospitals in Cleveland. A resident of Cleveland, she was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Raoul Abdul, a New York writer and longtime friend.         Dr. George was a sought-after lecturer, a trained soprano and a leading researcher of African-American music. Her encounter with Broadway was brought about by the composer Gian Carlo Menotti for the 1950 production of "The Medium," a folk opera, at the Arena stage of the Hotel Edison.         Dr. George had sung the opera's leading role of Madame Flora, a fraudulent spiritualist, at the dedication of the Karamu Lyric Theater in Cleveland the year before. 'Power and Imagination'         That production was a black version of the 1946 Menotti work. Learning of her performance, the composer brought her to New York to sing the part in a white production. She was the first black woman to take a white role on Broadway.         "She has great personal force," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. "She sings with power and imagination."         In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her as the only black member of the United States delegation to the 15th General Assembly of the United Nations. In the late 1960's, she was the executive director of the oldest Job Corps center in the United States, in Cleveland. The State Department once sent her on a six-month lecture tour around the world.         Dr. George was born in Hearne, Tex., and graduated from the University of Chicago. She studied voice at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and pipe organ at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. She briefly worked as a social worker in Evanston and spent seven years as a probation officer in Chicago.         From 1932 to 1937, she was the dean of women at Tennessee State University in Nashville. She then helped to organize the Avalon Community Center in Los Angeles and served as its executive director until she was named a Rockefeller Foundation research fellow in 1942. Studying Black Music         Starting early in her career, Dr. George lectured on the cultural contributions of blacks. In 1935 she began her research on black music and started a lecture series on human relations.         She returned to school to earn master's and doctoral degrees in sociology at New York University. Her Rockefeller grant enabled her to travel the country and cull data from libraries, private collections, cellars and attics. She spent six months in the Library of Congress alone.         The result was her doctoral thesis, "A Guide to Negro Music: An annotated bibliography of Negro folk music and art music by Negro composers or based on Negro thematic material." It was a compendium of 12,163 titles; she donated the manuscript to Howard University.         Dr. George sat on policy-making boards of the Girl Scouts of America, the American Red Cross, the League of Women Voters and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, among others.         She was married to Clayborne George, a lawyer in Cleveland and a prominent Republican there. He died many years ago.         Dr. George is survived by two sisters, A. Catherine Johnson of Massachusetts, and Vivian Edwards of Los Angeles, and a brother, Samuel E. J. Watson of Bangor, Mich.       
         Frances Riker Duncombe, a writer long active in Westchester community affairs, died on June 27 at Brandywine Nursing Home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. A resident of Cross River, N.Y., she was 93.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Born in Bernardsville, N.J., Mrs. Duncombe was educated at Miss Porter's School, Bryn Mawr College and the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts.         Between 1939 and 1967, she published seven children's books, including "Hoo DeWitt" (1941), "High Hurdles" (1941), "Eeemi, the Story of a Clown" (1946) and "The Quetzal Feather" (1968).         In later years, she was the author of "Summer of the Burning" (1976) and contributed to "Katonah: A History of a New York Village and Its People," published by the Katonah Improvement Society in 1961.         In 1975, she donated 48 acres to the Mount Holly Nature Preserve. She was active in the Katonah Women's Civic Club, the Bedford Historical Society and the League of Women's Voters of Bedford-Lewisboro.         Her husband, Herbert S. Jr., a lawyer, died in 1982 after 57 years of marriage.         Mrs. Dunscombe is survived by two sons, Herbert S. 3d, of Veneta, Ore., and David C., of White Salmon, Wash.; a daughter, Cynthia D. Bell of Oroville, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Jessie Sumner, an Illinois Republican who was the first woman elected to a county judgeship in her state and a conservative member of Congress from 1939 to 1947, died on Wednesday in Iroquois Memorial Hospital in Watseka, Ill. She was 96 and lived in nearby Milford.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Donna Rae Mann, Miss Sumner's assistant.         At her death, Miss Sumner was the president of Sumner National Bank, in Sheldon, Ill., which was founded by her father, Aaron Taylor Sumner. She took the post in 1966.         Miss Sumner was born on a farm in Iroquois County, Ill., grew up in that county and graduated from Smith College in 1920. She studied law at the University of Chicago and at Oxford and Columbia Universities. She worked as a lawyer in Chicago, New York and Milford.         In 1937, she became a judge in Iroquois County before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1938. She held the view, shared by many in her district in east-central Illinois, that the United States should not get involved in the war that was brewing in Europe.         After being elected to the House, she became nationally known as a foe of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and of his New Deal program and other policies. "What do I think of President Roosevelt?" she once asked, and then said she had come "to bury Caesar, not to praise him."         After World War II began in Europe in 1939, she found herself in a minority in Congress in voting against expanding the Navy. She was also among more than 100 representatives who voted, only months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, against extending the draft for a year.         After the United States entered the war in 1941, she criticized the country's allies, the conduct of the war, and Roosevelt Administration measures on the home front. She gained attention for her opposition to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which cared for refugees in Europe after the war, saying that if it was humanitarian, "so is keeping a gigolo."         Miss Sumner decided not to run for re-election in 1946. She then resumed practicing law in Milford and helped manage her family's insurance company, grain elevators and farms, in addition to the bank.         Survivors include a nephew, three nieces, six great-nephews and a great-niece.       
         Felisa Rincon de Gautier, Mayor of San Juan, P.R., from 1946 to 1969 and the only woman to hold that post, died on Friday in a nursing home in San Juan, where she had lived in recent months. She was 97.         She died after suffering a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.         She was appointed Mayor in 1946 to replace an incumbent who had resigned, and she was elected to office in later years. Running for another four-year term in 1964, she said, "After this term I want to lead my own life," and she did not run for re-election in 1968. Her other political work included membership on the Democratic National Committee.         Even before she became Mayor, Mrs. Rincon de Gautier, widely known as Dona Fela, worked on behalf of social causes, including the campaign to win Puerto Rican women the right to vote, which succeeded in 1932.         It was then that she went into politics, going on to press for child-care programs, centers for the elderly and legal aid for the poor. Her political power came in large part from the support of the city's poor residents, whom she organized within her Popular Democratic Party.         She worked hard to please the electorate. "My opponents campaign just before elections and then they disappear," she once said. "I start campaigning the day after the election and never stop."         She was also good at political repartee. After detractors said she had given city jobs to too many of her relatives, she replied: "I wish I had 20 more nieces. They work better -- for less."         As Mayor, she had a highly personal style that included enchanting local children by flying in planeloads of snow for Christmas parties. She maintained that personal touch even as San Juan grew, from a population of 180,000 when she first took office to 600,000 by 1961, when she was still meeting once a week with residents who needed advice or assistance.         But she also attended to larger matters, like public works. She was proud of having provided the city with well-equipped and hospitably managed dispensaries, as well as new schools and housing projects with nurseries and other amenities.         After stepping down as Mayor, she maintained her interest in politics. In 1992, at the age of 95, she was the oldest delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which was held in New York.         The eldest of eight children of a lawyer, she was born in Ceiba, 33 miles southeast of San Juan. She had to leave school at age 15 to care for her siblings.         Early in her life, she was a supporter of independence for Puerto Rico, but her views changed, and she went on to support the United States Commonwealth Constitution that came into effect in 1952.         In 1940, she married Jenaro A. Gautier, a lawyer who was secretary general of the Popular Democratic Party at the time. He died in 1971.       
         Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a lawyer who helped reshape the American juvenile justice system, died on Wednesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. She was 91 and lived in nearby Scottsdale.         She had suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis argued a landmark 1967 case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that juveniles charged with criminal offenses were entitled to the same procedural protections in juvenile courts that adults enjoyed in the criminal courts.         The case, In re Gault, dated from 1964, when a 15-year-old boy in Globe, Ariz., was accused of making a lewd telephone call to a woman in his neighborhood. Adjudged a delinquent, he faced detention in a reformatory until he turned 21, punishment that was coincidentally far greater than a similarly charged adult, enjoying greater courtroom protections, would have faced.         Mrs. Lewis took the case after the family of the boy, Gerald Gault, had virtually exhausted its appeals. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Arizona affiliate underwrote the effort, but Mrs. Lewis paid her way to Washington and her expenses there. She later said she had been drawn to the case because "I have raised three healthy sons, and I wanted to give something back."         In its 7-to-2 decision in Gerald's favor, the Supreme Court held that he was entitled to the constitutional safeguards that he had been denied: the right to legal counsel, the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to remain silent.         "Neither the 14th Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults only," Justice Abe Fortas wrote for the majority. "Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court."         Mrs. Lewis was born in the Bronx, received her law degree from St. Lawrence Law School (now Brooklyn Law School) and became one of the few women to be admitted to the New York bar in the early 1920's. She practiced in New York for 33 years and was working in the city's juvenile justice system when her husband, Maxwell Lewis, died in 1957.         She then moved to Arizona, where she took the bar examination with just one other woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, who in 1981 became the first woman on the Supreme Court. Mrs. Lewis continued to practice until two years ago.         She is survived by her three sons, Dr. David Lewis of Linkoping, Sweden, Frank Lewis of Phoenix, and Peter Lewis of Baltimore; a sister, Ernestine D. Hanwell of Atlanta; a brother, Paul Dietrich of Ridge, L.I.; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 8, 1994, Thursday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Nov. 19 about Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a former lawyer, misstated her role in a 1967 Supreme Court case that established that juveniles have essentially the same Constitutional safeguards in criminal proceedings as adults. Mrs. Lewis was co-counsel; Prof. Norman Dorsen of New York University Law School presented oral arguments on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.       
         Adda Bozeman Barkhuus, a writer and scholar of international relations at Sarah Lawrence College, died last Saturday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 85.         The cause was complications from a stroke, her family said.         She was professor emeritus of history and international relations at Sarah Lawrence, where she taught from 1947 to 1977. Many of her students went on to careers in the Foreign Service.         Professor Bozeman, as she was known professionally, was the author of many articles and papers as well as influential scholarly books. These include "Politics and Culture in International History: From the Ancient Near East to the Opening of the Modern Age," "Strategic Intelligence & Statecraft: Selected Essays," "Conflict in Africa: Concepts & Realities" and "Regional Conflicts Around Geneva," all of which remain in print.         She was a member of the editorial boards of ORBIS, a Journal of World Affairs; Asian Affairs, an American Review, and the Review for Comparative Study of Civilization.         She was born Adda von Bruemmer into a Baltic German family in Geistershof, Latvia, and graduated from l'Ecole Libre des Sciences Politique in Paris. She studied law in England to become a lawyer at the Middle Temple Inn of Court in London. She practiced with an international firm in Berlin, The Hague and London before moving to the United States in the late 1930's.         She received a doctorate in law at Southern Methodist University and did postgraduate studies at the Hoover Institute of Stanford University before being appointed an associate professor of history at Augustana College in Rockville, Ill. She started as a full professor at Sarah Lawrence in 1947.         Professor Bozeman is survived by her husband of 44 years, Dr. Arne Barkhuus; a daughter, Anya B. Taylor of South Nyack, N.Y.; a brother, Bodo von Bruemmer of Colares, Portugal, and two grandsons.       
         Margaret A. Hickey, a longtime advocate of women's rights, died on Wednesday in a Tucson, Ariz., nursing home, where she had lived for several years. She was 92 and had been a Tucson resident for more than 20 years.         At her death, Miss Hickey held the title of public affairs editor of Ladies' Home Journal, a position she had held since 1946.         A lawyer who became the owner and operator of a business school in St. Louis, Miss Hickey was prominent in World War II as chairwoman of the Women's Advisory Committee of the national War Manpower Commission, from 1942 to 1945.         At acommittee session in August 1944 she declared that the nation's "magnificent war production" was due to the "hidden army" of women working for victory. But near that war's end, she estimated that at least 500,000 women had lost their jobs as a result of cutbacks, and she called for measures to protect women in the workplace.         After the war, she served on a variety of high-level panels concerned with women's rights and other policy spheres. In January 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her chairwoman of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. The council had been set up in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy "to assure effective and continuing leadership in advancing the status of women." She headed it until 1966.         Miss Hickey was born in Kansas City, Mo., and earned a law degree from the University of Missouri in 1928.         She married Joseph T. Strubinger in 1935. He died in 1973.       
         Lillian Louise Poses, a lawyer who worked on the New Deal and was long active in public life, died on Sunday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Barbara Poses Kafka.         Mrs. Poses was among the first women to graduate from New York University's law school, her daughter said, and joined the New York bar in 1938, soon after it began admitting women, in 1937.         During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, she did legal work for several New Deal agencies.         In later years, she had a private practice in labor law representing several large corporations, and was active in the Governors Task Force on Unemployment, the Council Against Poverty, Unesco and the International League of Human Rights.         Mrs. Poses and her husband, Jack I. Poses, were active in philanthropic undertakings, especially in the arts and education.         Mrs. Poses was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Hunter College in 1927. Her husband died in 1982.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Kafka, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren and a brother, Abraham Shapiro, of Manhattan.       
         Catherine Filene Shouse, the philanthropist and arts patron who was the founder and major benefactor of the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts in Virginia, died yesterday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 98 and also had homes in Washington, Easton, Md., and Vienna, Va., where Wolf Trap is situated.         The cause of death was heart failure, said Carol Harford, a longtime friend who is president emeritus of the Wolf Trap Foundation, which presents the park's arts programs under the auspices of the Department of the Interior.         Mrs. Shouse, the heiress to a retailing fortune, was a lifelong champion of the performing arts whose accomplishments and philanthropic ventures earned recognition from the highest quarters. In 1977, President Gerald Ford gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A year earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had made her Dame Commander of the British Empire. This past October, she was among 12 Americans to receive the National Medal of Arts.         Catherine Filene was born in Boston in 1896. Her grandfather, William Filene, was the founder of the Filene's department-store chain, and her father, Lincoln Filene, founded Federated Department Stores. She graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1918, and earned a master's degree in education at Harvard University in 1923.         Over seven decades, Mrs. Shouse held a remarkable variety of public and private posts. In 1919, she became the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee, and in the mid-1920's, she served under President Calvin Coolidge as chairwoman of the First Federal Prison for Women, where she instituted a job training and rehabilitation program.         In the 1940's, she became a dog breeder, importing hunting dogs from Germany and Switzerland and starting her own kennel at Wolf Trap Farm, a tract of land across the Potomac River, 15 miles west of Washington, that she had purchased in 1930.         In 1949, she joined the National Symphony Orchestra's board, and she served as its vice president from 1951 through 1968. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now known as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to which she was reappointed twice by President Richard M. Nixon. As late as 1991, she was invited by the Yale School of Music to serve on its board.         Mrs. Shouse's most lasting legacy, however, is Wolf Trap. In 1966, at the age of 70, she donated 100 acres of the farm in Vienna to the United States Government to create a national park for the performing arts. There, under the auspices of the Department of the Interior, Mrs. Shouse established the Wolf Trap Foundation to manage the park, arrange programming and raise money, a unique partnership among the public and private sectors for managing an arts center. The park opened in 1971 and since then has been home to performances by some of the world's great musicians, dancers, singers and actors.         In 1982, the main amphitheater burned to the ground, but Mrs. Shouse led the drive to resurrect it, and a new theater, the 7,000-seat Filene Center (half the $18 million cost came from a Congressional appropriation), opened in 1984. It is now visited by some 500,000 people annually.         During her last decade, Mrs. Shouse, who was known to her friends as Kay, suffered from arthritis but remained a familiar figure at Wolf Trap, touring the grounds in a golf cart.         She was married twice, in 1921, to Alvin E. Dodd, a businessman from whom she was divorced in 1930. Two years later, she married Jouett Shouse, the chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee. Shouse, a lawyer and businessman, had been a Congressman from Kansas and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Coolidge. He died in 1967.         Mrs. Shouse is survived by a daughter, Joan Dodd Tolley of Naples, four grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Frances T. Freeman Jalet-Cruz, a legal-aid lawyer who fought for more humane conditions in the Texas prison system, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Manor in Trumbull, Conn. She was 84.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jalet (pronounced ja-LAY) was trained in international law but spent much of her career defending prisoners and the indigent. In Texas, newspapers came to label her "St. Frances of Houston" and "Portia of the Poor."         She arrived in the state in 1967 fresh from a course in poverty law at the University of Pennsylvania -- 57 years old and a white-haired mother of five grown children. Supported by a fellowship, she joined the Legal Aid and Defender Society of Travis County in Austin to defend the poor.         A newspaper article about her prompted a Mexican-American inmate and jailhouse lawyer named Fred Arispe Cruz to call her for assistance in appealing his robbery conviction. Hearing of inmates' complaints about what she considered harsh and often illegal treatment from the Texas Department of Corrections, she mounted a campaign on behalf of the prisoners.         She was in the thick of a stormy debate and bitter, costly litigation in the state's prison system in the 1960's and 1970's. She also caused a sensation in 1972 when, at the age of 61, she married Mr. Cruz, 32, after his release from prison. The marriage lasted six years.         The attention eventually led to a broader movement focusing on prison reform, and in the 1980's the Federal courts ordered sweeping changes in prisons statewide.         Her exploits and battle were chronicled in "Texas Prisons: The Walls Came Tumbling Down," by Steve J. Martin and Sheldon Ekland-Olson (Texas Monthly Press, 1987). The book's dedication cited "her unwavering belief in the rule of law."         She was born in Boston and graduated from Radcliffe College before earning advanced degrees at Columbia University Law School, Teachers College and Georgetown Law Center. She worked for the American Association of University Women and in various legal positions in Washington before moving to Texas.         Mrs. Jalet is survived by a son, Tuckerman S. Jalet of Westport, Conn.; four daughters, Jacqueline J. Gordon of Greenwich, Conn., Vanessa Jalet-Stanescu of Manhattan, Roberta J. Kurland of State College, Pa., and Frances Jalet-Miller of Queens, and eight grandchildren.       
         Kathleen P. Mahon, a lawyer who represented Federal law-enforcement officers, died yesterday at her home in Syosset, L.I. She was 49.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She graduated from Hofstra University and its law school, and was a partner in the firm of Mahon & Berger in Garden City, L.I. For the last 12 years she was general counsel to the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a volunteer organization.         With her partner, Lawrence Berger, she provided legal defense for thousands of law-enforcement officers and investigators facing criminal, civil or administrative charges.         She and her firm helped establish standards to protect officers from harassment, and to shield women, black and Hispanic officers from discrimination within their agencies. She also helped to shape policies on promotion and the dismissal and disciplining of Federal officers.         Ms. Mahon is survived by two daughters, Rebecca and Shana, and two sons, Joshua and Michael, all of Syosset; her father, John Mahon of Amityville, L.I.; and her brothers, Kerry Mahon of Selden, L.I., and Jack Mahon of Naples, Fla.
