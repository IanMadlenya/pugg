         Barbara E. Brooks, an editor at three major women's magazines, died yesterday at her sister's home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 39 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lymphoma, said the sister, Suzanne Steinau.         For the last four years Ms. Brooks was the home director of Family Circle, where she was in charge of the magazine's decorating, remodeling, gardening and crafts coverage.         In a project to adapt housing to the needs of modern working women, she and an architect and a builder -- both women -- created what they called the Busy Woman's Dream House, with a design that was streamlined to minimize housework and maintenance. The project was displayed at the National Association of Home Builders' show in Atlanta in 1990.         That same year Ms. Brooks's magazine work won an award from the International Home Furnishing Center.         She started her magazine career as an associate decorating editor at Mademoiselle. Later she was hired to edit major articles at House Beautiful. In 1980 she went to Family Circle, where she started as its decorating editor.         Ms. Brooks was born in Queens. She was a graduate of Boston University and earned a master's degree in fine arts from Sarah Lawrence.         Her sister is the only immediate survivor.       
         Diana Adams, who was a leading ballerina with both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater and the former dean of students at the School of American Ballet, died on Sunday at Mark Twain-St. Joseph's Hospital in San Andreas, Calif. She was 66 and lived in Arnold, Calif.         Miss Adams was one of George Balanchine's favorite dancers and created roles in many of his major ballets of the 1950's. Among her most complex parts was the almost fiendishly demanding pas de deux she danced with Arthur Mitchell in the Balanchine-Stravinsky "Agon" in 1957. Mr. Mitchell later said of the duet and its unusual pivots and balances, "Diana's nervous intensity made the whole pas de deux work because it's not so much the difficulty of the steps or how flexible you are, it's the precariousness."         She also appeared in films, performing with Danny Kaye in "Knock on Wood" (1954) and in "Invitation to the Dance" (1956), directed by Gene Kelly. A Versatile Talent         Miss Adams was born in Staunton, Va. Her family later moved to New York City, and she studied there at Ballet Arts School, where one of her teachers was Agnes de Mille. Miss Adams made her stage debut in 1943 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Oklahoma!," choreographed by Miss de Mille. In 1944, she joined Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was then known.         Her talent and versatility were soon recognized. She performed the title role in David Lichine's comic "Helen of Troy," was the malevolent Queen of the Wilis in "Giselle," and was praised for her poignancy in Antony Tudor's bittersweet "Jardin aux Lilas" and for her ferocity in "Undertow," Tudor's ballet about slum life. In 1948, she created the role of the mother in Miss de Mille's "Fall River Legend."         She joined the New York City Ballet in 1950 and performed with it until 1963. She had a remarkable interpretative range and was as compelling in Balanchine'sabstractions as she was in Tudor's dance-dramas. John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1951 that under Balanchine's guidance, Miss Adams "has become theepitome of the lyric dancer."         In addition to "Agon," she danced leading roles in the premieres of Tudor's "Lady of the Camellias" (1951), Frederick Ashton's "Picnic at Tintagel" (1952), and important Balanchine creations including "Caracole" (1952), "Opus 34" (1954), "Episodes" (1959) and "Liebeslieder Walzer" (1960). Transition Into Teaching         She began teaching at the School of American Ballet while still a member of the company. After she stopped dancing, she served as dean of students at Balanchine's request until she retired in 1971. It was Miss Adams who chose the teen-age Suzanne Farrell at a School of American Ballet audition in 1960.         Miss Adams married the dancer Hugh Laing in 1947; they were divorced in 1953. Her second marriage, to the stage manager and lighting designer Ronald Bates, also ended in divorce. In recent years, Miss Adams lived quietly in retirement, although she did teach for several companies, including the State Ballet of Missouri, which is directed by Todd Bolender, one of her former colleagues at the New York City Ballet.         She is survived by a daughter, Georgina Bates of Antioch, Calif.       
         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Audrey Hepburn, the actress who epitomized Hollywood chic in the 1950's and 60's, died yesterday at her home in Tolochenaz, near Lausanne, Switzerland. She was 63 years old and had undergone surgery for colon cancer in November.         Her death from cancer was announced by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, for which she had been a special ambassador since 1988.         In recent years, she made few movies, but traveled the world raising money and awareness for the U.N. organization. Her last screen role, in 1989, was a cameo as an angel easing the hero toward death in Steven Spielberg's "Always," a role in which the character's grace and serenity echoed the image Miss Hepburn had maintained throughout a 40-year career. An Oscar for a Princess         Her first major film role made her a star. In the 1953 romance "Roman Holiday," she played a princess who runs from her duties and falls in love with a journalist played by Gregory Peck. Audiences were enchanted by her combination of grace, elegance and high spirits, and she won an Academy Award as best actress.         The same year she won her Oscar, she won a Tony for her performance in the play "Ondine." Bosley Crowther, The New York Times critic, described her in words that characterized her youthful appeal. He called her "a slender, elfin and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike."         In a string of films that followed, she continued to play the lithe young thing with stars in her eyes and the ability to make Cinderella transformations. In "Sabrina" (1954), she was a chauffeur's daughter forced to choose between wealthy brothers, played by William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. In "Funny Face" (1957), opposite Fred Astaire, she played a bookstore clerk turned high-fashion model.         Descriptions of her beauty and appeal inevitably included the word "gamine." She was boyishly slender, with an aristocratic bearing, the trace of a European accent and a hint of mischief.  'A Wild-Eyed Doe'         Billy Wilder once recalled directing her in the 1957 film "Love in the Afternoon": "You looked around and suddenly there was this dazzling creature looking like a wild-eyed doe prancing in the forest. Everybody on the set was in love within five minutes."         Among her most popular and acclaimed roles was that of Holly Golightly, the backwoods beauty turned New York sophisticate in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961).         At the height of her career, she worked with such directors as William Wyler and George Cukor and acted with the great male movie stars of her day, playing the younger woman opposite Gary Cooper ("Love in the Afternoon"), Cary Grant ("Charade," 1963) and Rex Harrison, in the 1964 movie version of "My Fair Lady."         There was some grumbling from the theater world when she was cast as Eliza Doolittle in "My Fair Lady," winning the role over Julie Andrews, who had originated it on Broadway. Ms. Hepburn's singing was dubbed in the film by Marni Nixon. The film won several Oscar nominations, but Miss Hepburn was not nominated. A Blind Woman Terrorized         Throughout her career, she also took on dramatic roles. She won an Oscar nomination for the title role of a woman questioning her vocation in "A Nun's Story' (1959). She played a woman enduring 20 years of an embattled marriage, opposite Albert Finney, in "Two for the Road" (1967). And she won her fifth Oscar nomination for her role as a blind woman terrorized in her own home in "Wait Until Dark" (1967).  Other nominations were for "Sabrina" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         After "Wait Until Dark," she left full-time acting and lived mostly in Switzerland.         Miss Hepburn returned to the screen occasionally. In "Robin and Marian" (1976) she played the middle-aged Maid Marian to Sean Connery's Robin Hood. The role was considered the triumph of her later career and a reflection of the graceful way the actress herself had moved into middle age.         She also made some poorly received films, including "Bloodline" (1979) amd "They All Laughed" (1981).         Miss Hepburn, whose name originally was Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston, was born on May 4, 1929, near Brussels, to a Dutch mother and an English father, and was educated largely in London. During World War II, she and her mother were caught vacationing in Holland when the Nazis invaded and her family endured much hardship during the occupation. During the war, one of her brothers was taken to a labor camp, and an uncle and cousin were executed. She once said the family was reduced to eating tulip bulbs. Spotted by Colette         But when she returned to London after the war, her life took the glamorous turn she would maintain for the rest of her life. She was a ballet student and model. On the Riviera, she was spotted by the author Colette, who insisted that Miss Hepburn star in the Broadway version of "Gigi," which led to "Roman Holiday."         She attributed her work with Unicef to her childhood experience of hunger and fear during the war.         As Goodwill ambassador for Unicef she traveled extensively in Africa and Latin America. She visited Ethiopia during the drought to call attention to the plight of starving children. In 1991 she described her Unicef role as "talking my head off," and said, "I just decided to do as much as possible in the time that I'm still up to it."         Last year she visited Somalia. It was shortly after returning from that trip that her cancer was diagnosed. With Frequent Appearances         Even in her last years she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991. She was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that she and Elizabeth Taylor would receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award this year.         In 1954, she married the actor Mel Ferrer (with whom she later co-starred in "War and Peace.") They were divorced in 1968. In 1969 she married Andrea Dotti, an Italian psychiatrist, from whom she was later divorced.         Her companion since 1980 was Robert Wolders, a Dutch actor. She is also survived by two sons, Sean, from her marriage to Mr. Ferrer, and Luca, from her marriage to Dr. Dotti. The Sprite in Designer Clothing         Audrey Hepburn made her American stage and screen debuts in 1951, and two years later her gamin haircut, sylphlike shape and tomboyish but elegant demeanor in "Roman Holiday" made her a star and won her an Oscar. These are the plays and films in which she appeared.

         Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a prominent welfare expert and former government official whose criticisms of the welfare system provoked stormy policy debates, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece.         Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is in fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.         "Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."         Her pronouncements often stirred opposition from other officials, experts and advocates. Some accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people and minorities, which she denied.         Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring cheaters and ineligible recipients from welfare and reducing erroneous overpayments. High-Ranking Welfare Posts         In 1978-79 she headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed and praised her as "terrific."         But during her term more than 100,000 people were pared from the welfare rolls. After she came under fire from a number of black officials, Mr. Koch named a deputy with superseding power over her, and she resigned. The Mayor's action was widely interpreted as a concession to soothe his frayed minority relations.         Dr. Bernstein also served as the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance from 1975-77, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.         Later she recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."         An economist, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.         Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health care, welfare spending, family budgets and prenatal care. Director at New School         Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."         On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.         After retiring from the New School, she remained in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.         Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at Columbia.         Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.       
         Jeanne Sauve, a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada in the 1980's, died on Tuesday in Montreal. She was 70.         Her death was announced by the office of the Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II. It did not give the cause of death.         A former television journalist and freelance columnist, Mrs. Sauve entered politics in 1972 by winning election as a Member of Parliament from a district outside Montreal now known as Laval-les-Rapides.         After two years as a back-bencher, she was named as a junior minister in the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, overseeing science and technology and eventually the environment and communications. A Difficult Passage         But it was as Speaker, the keeper of the rules and traditions in the lower house, that Mrs. Sauve broke barriers and gained a national reputation.         When she was named to the post in 1980, she was still best known as part of a political elite that had congregated in Montreal in the 1950's to discuss art and politics and nationalism.         One participant was Mr. Trudeau, then a law professor and editor; another was Rene Levesque, a radio commentator who would later became a secessionist and Premier of Quebec, and a major adversary of Mr. Trudeau.         Her appointment drew criticism. Not only was she the first woman to preside over a forum that is still overwhelmingly male, but she was viewed by the Conservative opposition as lacking established ties to the House and knowledge of its often baroque procedures.         In her first two years, Mrs. Sauve was severely tested by strategists from the opposition who barraged her with points of order and privilege. But eventually even her adversaries paid tribute to her firmness and fairness, and she remained Speaker until 1984. Finally Won Respect         When Mr. Trudeau named her to the largely ceremonial but highly respected position of Governor General, she was also the first woman in that post, where she served until 1990.         Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit in Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, on April 26, 1922. She was educated at the University of Ottawa and University of Paris.         In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman who also served as a minister to Mr. Trudeau; he died last year. She is survived by a son, Jean-Francois.         Correction:  January 29, 1993, Friday         An obituary headline yesterday about a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada misidentified her. She was Jeanne Sauve.       
         Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.         "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."         Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.  Advocate of an Early Start         "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.         Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."         After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.         Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."         Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.         Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.         "I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."         Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.         Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."         Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.         Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.         At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.         When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway. She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith         In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.         That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.         He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.         That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.         In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit. One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts         Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.         During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.         Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.         First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.         "In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."         Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.  Propaganda Films For World War I         During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.         Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.         In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.         Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.         The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."         "Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."         With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."         In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.         Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad. From the Silents To the Talkies         Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.         Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.         As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."         Correction:  March 2, 1993, Tuesday         A picture in some copies yesterday with an obituary of Lillian Gish, showing a scene from "Life With Father," was published in error. It showed Dorothy Gish.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.  Plays         Bab 1920  We Moderns 1923  Caesar and Cleopatra 1925  What Every Woman Knows 1926, 1938, 1954  Coquette 1927  Mary of Scotland 1933  Victoria Regina 1935  Ladies and Gentlemen 1939  Twelfth Night 1940  Harriet 1943  Happy Birthday 1946  The Wisteria Trees 1950  Mrs. McThing 1952  The Skin of Our Teeth 1955, 1961  The Glass Menagerie 1948, 1956, 1961  Time Remembered 1957  A Touch of the Poet 1958  The School for Scandal 1966  Right You Are (If You Think You Are) 1966  We Comrades Three 1966  The Show-Off 1967  The Front Page 1969  Harvey 1970 Films         The Sin of Madelon Claudet 1931  Arrowsmith 1931  A Farewell to Arms 1932  Night Flight 1933  What Every Woman Knows 1934  Vanessa, Her Love Story 1935  My Son John 1952  Anastasia 1956  Airport 1970 Television         The Snoop Sisters 1972  Victory at Entebbe 1976  A Family Upside Down 1978  Murder Is Easy 1982  A Caribbean Mystery 1983  Murder With Mirrors 1985       
         Kate Reid, an actress whose hundreds of roles included starring onstage in "Death of a Salesman," in the film "Atlantic City" and in television episodes of "Dallas," died on Saturday at her home in Stratford, Ontario. She was 62.         The cause of death was cancer, said her agent, Richard Schmenner.         For more than 40 years she was staple of stage, movies and television in the United States, Canada and Britain. A 1984 New York Times profile said, "Kate Reid may not be a household name to the general public, but she is to the theater industry, which knows her as an actress who works constantly."         Perhaps her most widely praised performance was as the wife of Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman in the acclaimed revival of "Death of a Salesman" on Broadway in 1984 and for television in 1985.         "In the problematic role of the mother, Kate Reid is miraculously convincing," Frank Rich wrote in The Times, adding that "she somehow melds affection with pure steel." Richard Schickel said in Time magazine that her performance was "in its way as awesome as Hoffman's." A String of Nominations         Twice she was nominated for Tony Awards, first for co-starring with Alec Guinness in "Dylan" in 1964, then for her performance in "Slapstick Tragedy" on Broadway in 1965.         She was also twice nominated for Emmy Awards, for playing Queen Victoria in "The Invincible Mr. Disraeli" in 1963, then Mary Todd Lincoln in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" in 1964. Both were "Hallmark Hall of Fame" productions.         In the 1981 film "Atlantic City," she won high marks for her portrayal of the reclusive, aging former beauty queen and sometime paramour of the small-time mobster played by Burt Lancaster.         Ms. Reid, whose voice was described as cello-toned, once said: "I'm a chameleon. There is something of everything I play in me."         Her stage work included many Shakespearean parts, especially at the Stratford Festival in Canada in the 1960's. Major Roles on Broadway         In her Broadway debut in 1962, she was praised for her performance as Martha in the matinee cast of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" In 1968, she co-starred in "The Price," by Arthur Miller. She played Big Mama in the 1974 revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea and Fred Gwynne.         Her films include "The Andromeda Strain" (1971), "A Delicate Balance" (1973) and "Equus" (1977). Her many television roles included recurring appearances in "Dallas" as Aunt Lil Trotter.         Miss Reid was born in London and grew up in Toronto. She began acting while attending Havergal College, the University of Toronto and the Toronto Conservatory of Music, then formally studied acting under Uta Hagen at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.         Her marriages to Michael Sadlier and Austin Willis ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Reid Willis of Edmonton, Alberta, and a daughter, Robin Willis of Manhattan.       
         Pina Carmirelli, a violinist who appeared as a soloist and in chamber-music ensembles, died on Saturday at her home in Rome. She was 79.         She died after a long illness, said Frank Salomon, a co-administrator of the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont, where Miss Carmirelli was a participant for many years.         Miss Carmirelli was a soloist with many leading orchestras of Europe, including the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonics and the London Symphony. She was the first violinist in the Italian chamber orchestra I Musici, which often performed at Carnegie Hall and other major halls in the United States and Europe.         She had a long association with the pianist Rudolf Serkin, the founder of the Marlboro Music School and Festival, and often appeared in chamber performances with Music from Marlboro, both in Vermont and on tour.         An authority on the composer Boccherini, she helped uncover some of his chamber works and founded the Boccherini Quintet and the Carmirelli Quartet, which specialized in Boccherini's music. She taught at the Accademia di S. Cecilia in Rome.       
         Martha Dalrymple, a co-author of an exhaustive study of New York City landmarks, died on Monday in Portland, Ore., where she had moved 17 years ago. She was 89.         The cause of death was chronic lung disease and heart failure, said her half-sister, Joanna Stuart of Portland.         With Harmon H. Goldstone, a former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miss Dalrymple wrote "History Preserved: A Guide to New York City Landmarks and Historic Districts" (1974). The book included city landmarks dating from 1650 to 1930.         Mr. Goldstone, an architect, was a major force in establishing the Landmarks Commission and served as its chairman from 1968 to 1973. Miss Dalrymple worked for several years as a volunteer for the commission, and their collaboration on the 576-page volume was a result.         She was a 1925 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and began her career as a journalist. She worked for The Chicago Journal and then for The Associated Press, reporting from New York City, Washington, London, Rome and Moscow. She was hired by Nelson A. Rockefeller for the Office of Inter-American Affairs, for which he was the coordinator. She also wrote a history of the American International Association for Economic and Social Development, entitled "The A.I.A. Story: Two Decades of International Cooperation" (1968).       
         Judith Rothschild, an abstract painter whose works were shown internationally and who left a multi-million-dollar estate to support contemporary American artists, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan and in Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Ms. Rothschild painted for 55 years, beginning as a teen-ager. Her works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery in Washington and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., among others.         Her works were exhibited in many group shows and in several one-woman shows, including the first devoted to an American artist by the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, in 1991. Legacy to Museums and Artists         Ms. Rothschild left a collection that included her paintings and major works by Mondrian, Matisse, Brancusi, Gris and Picasso. The estate could bring up to $40 million, said its executor, Erik Stapper, and Harvey Miller, the trustee of the Judith Rothschild Foundation.         Under her will, the proceeds are to be used to foster art by helping public galleries and museums buy works of contemporary American artists over the next 25 years.         Ms. Rothschild was a founder and president of the American Abstract Artists Association. She also served on the boards of the American Federation of Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the New York Studio School and the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center.         A longtime colleague of Robert Motherwell, she joined him and a few other artists in forming a cooperative, the Long Point Gallery, in Provincetown on Cape Cod. A Youthful Talent         Ms. Rothschild displayed a flair for art as a youngster. Because of her interests, her parents began collecting art, including some of the major pieces now part of her estate. Her father, Herbert, owned a furniture manufacturing company.         Ms. Rothschild was born in New York City and graduated from Wellesley College. She studied painting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, and with Karl Knaths and Hans Hofmann.         She worked in oils and did many collages. Her style ranged from Cubist imagery to symbolic use of astrology charts, timetables, stamps and railroad tickets.         Her 23-year marriage to Anton Myrer, a novelist, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Manhattan, and a sister, Barbara Michaels of Ossining, N.Y.       
         Julia Knickerbocker, a leader in the field of book publicity, died on Sunday at the Robert Janker Clinic in Bonn. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after fighting cancer for two years, said her sister, Miranda de Kay.         A longtime public relations executive in book publishing, Ms. Knickerbocker influenced a whole generation of young public relations executives who now hold significant positions in various houses. She was known for her elegance, wit and style.         At her death, she was vice president and director of media relations at Bantam Books in New York. There she worked with authors such as Robert Pirsig, whose "Lila" (1991) became a major best seller.         "She was that rare publicist equally adept at getting attention for literary, serious kiss-and-tell and pop entertainment novels," said Stuart Applebaum, vice president of publicity and public relations at Bantam Doubleday Dell.         Much of her career was with Simon & Schuster, where she began in 1974 as a senior publicist and rose to be associate publisher. For more than a decade as director of publicity, she was the driving force behind all of Simon & Schuster's campaigns, working with such best-selling authors as Jackie Collins and Jane Fonda.         She began her career at M. Evans & Company in 1967 and later headed the publicity department at William Morrow & Company.         She was born in Paris, where her father, H. R. Knickerbocker, was a correspondent for United Press. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1958.         Her marriage to Charles La Muniere ended in divorce.         Besides her sister Mrs. de Kay, she is survived by another sister, Suzanne Colt, and two daughters, Noelle La Muniere McElroy Carter and Suzanne La Muniere, all of Manhattan.       
         Eunice Saunders Carroll, an employee of Sotheby's for 40 years and the director of its Special Client Services Department, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 73.         A Sotheby's associate said the cause was pneumonia.         During her years with Sotheby's, herpurchases for auction sales totaled well into the billions of dollars, including the Duchess of Windsor's jewels and the collections of Greta Garbo, Florence Gould and Andy Warhol.         Mrs. Carroll was born in North Carolina and taught English for several years before becoming a paymaster in the Navy during World War II. She later came to New York and took a job as a bookkeeper at Parke-Bernet Galleries, Sotheby's predecessor in the United States. After the two merged, she became a vice president and, in 1978, a senior vice president.         She was among the early in-house bidders -- Sotheby's representatives who initiate telephone bids for major art collectors who do not want to appear on the auction floor.         She is survived by her son, James Carroll of Greenfield, Mass; her daughter, Nedda Carroll of High Falls, N.Y.; her niece, Cynthia Leigh Young of New York City; three sisters, Inez Alexakos of Stafford, Va., Jeanette Lucas of Crofton, Md., and Josephine Lee of Lake Katrine, N.Y., and her brother, Eriel Saunders of Willow Springs, N.C.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Hannah Troy, an influential women's fashion designer and manufacturer who invented the petite size and introduced modern Italian styles to the United States, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Miami Beach, where she lived. She was 93.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Her two major contributions to fashion resulted from chance and keen observation.         "I was at a May Company store in California when I noticed women pulling at their shoulders and waistlines and saw that most dresses didn't fit properly," she recalled from the late 1940's. Alterations were troublesome and sometimes spoiled the design.         On a hunch that the long-waisted ideal female form was more myth than reality, she studied measurements the military had made of women who volunteered in World War II. The statistics confirmed that the typical woman was short-waisted.         So Mrs. Troy introduced the petite size, saying, "The word had a nice ring." The concept proved a popular success. The Italian Look         Her next innovation came in 1951. After the annual Paris fashion shows, she took a side trip to Florence. Impressed with its fashions, she bought samples and returned home promoting the Italian look.         The following season, 300 American fashion representatives showed up in Italy and a new era began.         In the mid-1960's she advocated the tent dress so "the woman who is a little plump can look stylish."         Mrs. Troy described her fashions as "elegant, somewhat classic, timeless, the kind a woman can add to from year to year." She produced blouses, dresses, gowns and suits, favoring silk, wool, tweed, linen, taffeta and satin.         Her career was at its peak from the late 1940's until her retirement in 1968. She supplied top Manhattan stores like Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller, Henri Bendel, Lord & Taylor, B. Altman and Bloomingdale's. Pat Nixon and Mamie Van Doren were among her customers.         Mrs. Troy, a Brooklyn native, grew up in the garment industry.         "I started sewing as soon as I could thread a needle," she said. By 12 she was making dresses for her sisters. As a teen-ager, she was a model. After graduating as the valedictorian at Erasmus Hall High School, she worked at a blouse company, then opened her business.         She supported charities and made a personal cause of the Mazzini School in Florence after learning that some poor students took turns going to class because their families had only one coat and one pair of shoes to share among the siblings.         Mrs. Troy had three marriages, to Aaron Hartman, Theodore Troy and Max Meyer, all deceased.         She is survived by a son from her first marriage, William J. Troy, and a sister, Shirley Stern, both of Miami, and two grandchildren.       
         Wilma Shannon Warburg, a civic leader and philanthropist, died on Friday at her home in Middleburg, Va. She was 89.         Mrs. Warburg was a benefactor and board member of charitable organizations in Middleburg and New York City. She lived in Manhattan for many years.         She was on the board of the Henry Street Settlement for nearly 30 years and was also an active supporter of Lenox Hill Hospital.         She was married to Frederick Warburg, an investment banker, sportsman and philanthropist. He was the eldest son of Felix M. Warburg, a young German banker who became a major financier in the United States, whose family mansion on Fifth Avenue is now the Jewish Museum.         Mrs. Warburg was born in Rochester and graduated from Smith College.         She worked in volunteer efforts during World War II, and after the war worked in management at Macy's.         Her husband died in 1973. She is survived by nieces and nephews.       
         Elinor Merrell, a decorator and dealer in antique textiles, died on Saturday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 98 and lived in Cross River, N.Y., and Manhattan.         Her lawyer, Theodore R. Wagner, said the cause was complications from a stroke last October.         For nearly 65 years, Miss Merrell operated her business, Elinor Merrell Antiques, in several different shops on the East Side of Manhattan and since 1981, from her apartment on East 78th Street. Amassing a major collection of museum-caliber textiles, she would sell swatches to fabric houses to copy.         A specialist in 17th- and 18th-century French textiles, she served as consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to the Art Institute of Chicago. She also assisted in the development of the collections at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Fine Arts, the Winterthur Museum and Colonial Williamsburg.         In 1954 Miss Merrell was a founder of the New York Winter Antiques Show, which developed a reputation for its top-quality art and decorative objects. She was a regular exhibitor at the show until 1990, when she and several other dealers pulled out over a dispute with the management.         She was born in Cleveland, attended finishing school in Switzerland and graduated from Vassar College in 1917. Afflicted with polio as a girl, she had to use a cane most of her life.         During a trip to Europe in the early 1920's, she discovered old French chintzes and toiles de Jouy (18th-century cotton prints) from a village near Versailles. She returned to New York and exhibited her antique textiles at the Anderson Galleries in 1925. Later she also developed an interest in French provincial furniture.         She is survived by two nieces, Jane Jennison of Taftville, Vt., and Susan Faragoh of Castro Valley, Calif., and a nephew, Frank Faragoh of Knoxville, Tenn.       
         Mary Ellen Forbes Kramer, who led the campaign to preserve and redevelop the historic mill district in Paterson, N.J., died on Monday at a hospital in Norwalk, Conn. She was 56 and lived in Little Falls, N.J., and Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kramer became active in civic affairs as the wife of Paterson's Mayor for 14 years, Lawrence (Pat) Kramer. In her first major issue, she led the efforts that blocked state plans to build a highway that would have destroyed some old silk mills.         After that success, she became the executive director of the Great Falls Development Corporation and worked to preserve the mills, which were built in the early 1800's and used the water power of the 77-foot-high Great Falls. The buildings were adapted to new uses, including the Paterson Museum, offices and artists' residences.         In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford visited the district to proclaim its national landmark status, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave Mrs. Kramer an award. New Career at College         She started a new career in 1980 as the director of community affairs at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.         There she was instrumental in founding the Wayne Chamber Orchestra, creating the annual Legacy Awards to raise scholarship funds, collecting more than $300,000 to restore the Hobart Manor on campus and organizing a popular annual lecture series with speakers like Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, Alvin Toffler and Beverly Sills.         She also served on the boards of St. Joseph's Hospital and the Straight and Narrow drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, both in New Jersey.         Mrs. Kramer was born in Paterson. After graduating from Mary Washington College she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology from George Washington University and briefly practiced as a school psychologist. She was divorced.         Surviving are her companion, Irving Appleman; her mother, Catherine Forbes of Wyckoff, N.J.; a daughter, Patricia Kimberly Sposa of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Lawrence 3d, also known as Kip, and Patrick, also known as Kelly, both of Paterson; three brothers, Cyril Forbes of Montclair, N.J., William Forbes of Paterson and Paul Forbes of Morristown, N.J., and two sisters, Joan Forbes of Wyckoff and Nancy Braithwaite of Nassau, the Bahamas.       
         Caroline Klein Simon, who overcame early obstacles to women in the legal profession to become a pioneering female judge, politician, state official and champion of laws against discrimination in jobs and housing, died yesterday at home. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Judge Simon, who was still active as a lawyer at her death, served in state posts under appointments from both Republican and Democratic governors and was the first woman nominated by a major party for citywide office in New York City.         She helped draft the nation's first state law barring job discrimination and later led the nation in imposing regulations against racial "block busting" by real-estate brokers.         Judge Simon's credo was simple. "I am against discrimination in any form," she said.         During her own career, she faced discrimination from the very beginning.         She was rejected for admission to Columbia University's law school in the 1920's because it did not have toilets and other accommodations for female students, her family said. So she earned her law degree at New York University instead. Failed Search for Paying Job         After graduation, despite her strong academic record and passing the bar examination, she was turned down by every firm where she applied to become a law clerk. She finally offered to work free for a year "to convince them that a woman could be a lawyer," she later recalled.         Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst took her up and after the year was up she was offered a permanent job. But she decided instead to work for indigent clients and family planning groups.         Three decades later, she was a leading candidate to become the Postmaster of New York in 1958 but was vetoed by Federal officials. The New York Times reported, based on officials close to the Postmaster General, "Opposition to the appointment of Mrs. Caroline K. Simon was based on the ground that the job was unsuited to a woman."         In a widely quoted speech the next year, she said: "There are four things a woman needs to know. She needs to know how to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog." Worked Under Dewey         Her public service began in the 1930's when she was instrumental in changing state laws to entitle women to serve as jurors and was herself among the first called for service.         District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of Manhattan named her to a panel on revising the Domestic Relations Court Act. During World War II she served as the Office of Civilian Defense's director of group activities in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.         Mr. Dewey, by then Governor, appointed her to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board in 1944-45 and the temporary State War Council's Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1943-45.         Eager to continue the fight against discrimination, she helped draft the nation's first state law on job bias based on race, religion or nationality and became a founding member of the resulting State Commission Against Discrimination. City Council Race         In 1956, Gov. W. Averell Harriman, a Democrat, appointed her to the new State Youth Commission.         The next year she ran for City Council President as a Republican. Although she lost to Abe Stark by about two-to-one, she still ran some 100,000 votes ahead of her ticket and received the biggest total for a citywide Republican candidate.         In 1958 she served as the legal advisor to the American delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         In 1959 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, inducted her as New York's Secretary of State, the second woman to hold that post. It was in that role that she issued the nation's first regulations against block busting, in which brokers manipulated property owners' fears about racial or ethnic changes in the neighborhood to provoke sales.         It was her marriage to Leopold K. Simon, a lawyer, that ignited her interest in the law.         They divorced in the early 1950's. She remarried, to Irving W. Halpern, the chief probation officer of the Court of General Sessions, who died in 1966.         Her survivors include her son, Lee K., of Wilmington, N.C.; a daughter, Cathy Prince of White Plains; a brother, Nathan F. Klein of Titusville, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         A service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street in Manhattan.       
         Tatiana Troyanos, an American mezzo-soprano whose enormous repertory covered the full range of operatic history, from Monteverdi to Philip Glass, died on Saturday evening at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her manager, Janice Mayer at Columbia Artists, said the cause was cancer.         Miss Troyanos's dark, flexible mezzo was ideal for the wrenching emotionalism of such characters as Carmen, Kundry in Wagner's "Parsifal," Eboli in Verdi's "Don Carlo," Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," and both Purcell's and Berlioz's Didos.         She was also a superb player of trouser roles. Her Octavian in "Rosenkavalier" was long the centerpiece of her repertory, and early in her career she gave highly regarded performances as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Romeo in Bellini's "Capuletti e i Montecchi." And she was prized for the kind of vocal and dramatic agility, as well as the ability to learn difficult roles quickly, that made her a singer of choice for revivals of rarely performed Handel and Mozart works.         Her appearances in the last year indicate the scope of her repertory. In September she created the role of Queen Isabella in Philip Glass's "Voyage" at the Met. She performed in two "Ring" cycles, as Waltraute in the Metropolitan Opera's "Gotterdammerung" and Fricka in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's "Rheingold." In May she gave what James R. Oestreich called in The New York Times "a searching, almost harrowing reading" of the Mahler Third Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and last month she sang Clairon in the San Francisco Opera production of Strauss's "Capriccio."         Tatiana Troyanos was born in New York on September 12, 1938, and grew up in Forest Hills. Her mother was German and her father Greek, and though she admittedly neither spoke Greek nor cared for Greek food, she identified closely with her father's homeland and described herself as Greek-American.         Both her parents were singers, and she sang in school and church choruses, but her first serious musical training was as a pianist. It was only during her high school years, when she began to listen to Maria Callas recordings and attend Metropolitan Opera performances as a standee, that she decided to study singing. While working at Random House as a secretary she enrolled at the Juilliard School, but left when the dean refused to let her study with the teacher of her choice, Hans Heinz. She studied privately with him for many years, continuing even after she began to sing professionally.         Miss Troyanos found few opportunities in New York, but she was a fighter: When the Met offered her small roles, she turned them down, and when she was denied a chorus role in "The Sound of Music" because Richard Rodgers thought her too glamorous to play a nun, she returned looking disheveled and got the part. Her first break was in 1963, when Julius Rudel signed her to the New York City Opera roster. She made her debut that year as Hippolyta in Benjamin Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream," and also sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex."         In 1965, following Heinz's suggestion that she would benefit from experience at a European house, she joined the Hamburg State Opera, where she made her way through a large part of the mezzo-soprano repertory in her decade there. But her first major appearances were at Aix-en-Provence, France, where she made her debut in 1966 as the Composer in Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," and at Covent Garden, where she performed her first Octavian in 1969, learning the role in a week to fill in for another singer.         Miss Troyanos made her Met debut as Octavian in 1976, and became one of the house's most frequently heard mezzos. Among the many roles she sang there were the Countess Geschwitz in Berg's "Lulu," Sesto in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito," Charlotte in "Werther," Adalgisa in "Norma," and her regular showpieces, Carmen, Kundry, Santuzza and the Composer.         In addition to her opera appearances, Miss Troyanos was an eloquent recitalist. Particularly interesting in recent years were her duo recitals with the soprano Benita Valente. After their last New York performance together, at Alice Tully Hall in January 1992, Bernard Holland wrote in The Times: "Ms. Troyanos's mezzo-soprano is intended less as a thing of beauty (which it often is) than as a conduit for the pain, exaltation and rushes of emotion that suffuse her musical personality."  A Recorded Legacy         Miss Troyanos made many first-rate recordings. Among those available on compact disk are performances in Leonard Bernstein's recording of his "West Side Story" (Deutsche Grammophon), "Carmen" (London), "Werther" (Angel), "Cosi Fan Tutte" (RCA), "Le Nozze di Figaro" (Deutsche Grammophon) and Schoenberg's "Gurre-Lieder" (Philips). Her recent San Francisco appearance in "Capriccio" was taped for video release; other video performances include a memorable Sesto in the Jean-Pierre Ponelle production of "La Clemenza di Tito" (Deutsche Grammophon) and, with the Metropolitan Opera, Venus in Wagner's "Tannhauser" and Dido in Berlioz's "Troyens."         She is survived by her mother, Hildegard Fournier of Florida, and her brother, John, of New York.       
         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Dr. Barbara Biber Bodansky, a leading researcher in child psychology and early education for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 89.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Dr. Biber -- the name she used professionally -- was chairman of the child development faculty of the Bank Street College of Education from 1931 to 1960. She directed its research division from 1950 to 1963.         In those positions, she played a central role in creating several new graduate and research programs dealing with early education theory, child psychology and social policy.         In 1973 she became a Distinguished Research Scholar Emeritus at the college, which is on 112th Street near Broadway and was founded in 1916 as a center for training and research in early childhood education. Strong Self-Images         As a teacher, Dr. Biber believed that the best early education programs develop the emotional life of children as well as their intellects, foster strong self-images, encourage responsibility to others, and support imagination and curiosity.         Toward that end, Dr. Biber, along with her colleagues at the college, helped to establish teacher workshops in New York City public schools in the 1940's and 50's.         In the 1960's she directed a study of schools and mental health with a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health. At the end of that decade, she began devising the basic principles for federally financed day care and Head Start programs.         At the age of 80, she completed "Early Education and Psychological Development" (Yale University Press, 1984). She also was co-author of two books reporting major research studies: "Child Life in School" (1942) and "The Pyschological Impact of School Experience" (1969).         Dr. Biber, who was born in Brooklyn, first attended Barnard College and then graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1942 from Columbia University.         In 1929, Dr. Biber was married to Dr. Oscar Bodansky, chief of clinical biochemistry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He died in 1977.         She is survived by a daughter, Margery B. Franklin of Manhattan; two grandsons, Kenneth and David Frankin, and a sister, Lilian Uviller Pilat.       
         Dr. Daphne A. Roe, a dermatologist and nutrition expert, died on Wednesday at a community hospital in Ithaca, N.Y., after having been injured earlier in the day in an automobile accident near Trumansburg, N.Y. She was 70.         Dr. Roe was a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at Cornell University. Her expertise ranged from the role of beta carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in protecting the human immune system from sunlight to nutritional deficiencies in the elderly to interactions between drugs and nutrients.         In the last 15 years she taught nutrition to graduate students from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.         Awards in 1987         Dr. Roe was a fellow of the American Institute of Nutrition. Her honors included the American Medical Association's Joseph B. Goldberger Award in Clinical Nutrition in 1987, and, the same year, the Lederle Award of the American Institute of Nutrition, which described her as "a major contributor to the recognition of drug-induced nutritional deficiencies."         Her most recent research was in nutrition and aging, particularly the role of carotenoids, including beta carotene, in the protection of the immune systems of older people. She found that moderate doses of beta carotene can protect people from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light on the immune system. She also established a link between overexposure to sunlight and reduction of beta carotene in plasma. In Time, the Priesthood         Beta carotene is a nutrient that the human body converts to vitamin A; some researchers believe it plays a role in reducing the risk of cancer.         In 1984, she found that the recommended dietary allowance for riboflavin was insufficient for women who exercise, and proposed a doubling of that level.         Her books included "Drug-Induced Nutritional Deficiencies" (1976), "Alcohol and Diet," (1980), "Nutrition and the Skin" (1986) and "Geriatric Nutrition" (1992).         At the time of her death she was in divinity school, a candidate for the Episcopal priesthood.         Dr. Roe was born in London. She was graduated from the University of London in 1945, where she received her M.D. degree five years later. In 1963, she joined the Cornell faculty.         She is survived by two sons -- Adrian, of Pittsburgh, and David, of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Laura, of Hartford, and a grandson.       
         Florence Small Gaynor, the first black woman to head a major teaching hospital in the United States, died on Sept. 16 at Christiana Medical Center in Newark, Del. She was 72.         She died unexpectedly after a sudden brain hemorrhage, said her son, Wardell.         Mrs. Gaynor, a registered nurse by training, rose through the ranks of administration at several large New York hospitals at a time when there were few women or blacks in such positions. In February 1971, she was chosen from a field of 20 candidates, the rest of them male, to be executive director of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, making her the first black woman ever to head one of the city's municipal hospitals.         Eighteen months later she accepted a job in New Jersey, as executive director of Martland Hospital in Newark, a 600-bed teaching hospital operated by the state's medical school. Now part of the the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, it was then the state's largest hospital. Struggle to Become Nurse         Born in Jersey City, the fourth of six girls, Mrs. Gaynor fought racial barriers from the time she graduated from high school, at the age of 15, to get training to become a nurse. The first nursing school where she applied, at Jersey City Medical Center, turned her down because it did not admit blacks.         She worked at a doll factory and at an electric plant to help support her family and then applied the nursing school at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated as a registered nurse in 1946 and worked first at Queens General Hospital.         After a stint as a public-health nurse in East Harlem for New York City's Health Department, she worked as head nurse at Francis Delafield Hospital in Washington Heights and as a school nurse with the Board of Education in Newark.         At the same time she was pursuing a bachelor's degree in nursing and then a master's degree in public health at New York University. She spent the summer of 1965 at the University of Oslo in Norway studying the Scandinavian health system.         When she returned, she pursued a career in hospital administration, starting in the pediatrics department of Lincoln Hospital, which is staffed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. After a series of promotions, she was named assistant administrator in 1970.         After heading Sydenham Hospital and Martland Hospital, she left the Northeast to serve from 1976 to 1980 as director of hospital and health services at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school that has produced many of the nation's black doctors.         From 1980 until 1984, she was director of the West Philadelphia Community Mental Health Consortium in Philadelphia. For two years, before she retired in Wilmington, Del., she worked again as a school nurse, in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Wardell Michael Gaynor of Brooklyn and Matthew Small Gaynor of Cincinnati; a daughter, Brenda L. Gainer of Wilmington; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Mary E. Clark, a lawyer who successfully campaigned for a change in Florida law so that people with major illnesses would not lose a large part of their medical insurance coverage, died here on Saturday. She was 37.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Keith Westerberg.         After discovering she had cancer in 1988, Ms. Clark thought her group insurance policy would cover her medical expenses up to $1 million. But after she retired because of her health, she discovered that her $1 million policy had been reduced to $250,000.         She took her case to court and to the public. Statewide Campaign         For four years she traveled across the state, arguing before newspaper editorial boards and at legislative meetings that insurance companies should not be able to reduce the medical benefits of people forced to retire because of illness.         She also sued her insurance company and won the right to medical benefits up to $1 million. But that decision was overturned on appeal.         In 1992, however, she persuaded the Legislature to increase minimum lifetime medical insurance benefits for individuals to $500,000.         "Most people in Mary's position do not have the time, energy, financial resources or legal resources to contest this sort of inequity," Mr. Westerberg said. "Mary did, and she helped change this unfair law for everyone."         Born in Washington, she moved to Sarasota to attend New College and later studied law at the University of Virginia. She was the managing attorney with Gulfcoast Legal Services, providing legal aid to people who were unable to afford lawyers.         In addition to her husband, survivors include her parents, William M. and Dorothy Clark of Arlington, Va., and a brother, John, of Sarasota.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Lucia Popp, a lyric soprano who sang with a silken clarity that made her a favorite in Mozart and Strauss roles, died yesterday in Munich, Germany. She was 54 and lived in Zurich.         The cause was a brain tumor, said Mariedi Anders, her manager.         An elegant, flexible interpreter whose voice had a light, transparent texture, Miss Popp brought emotional depth and perspective to a wide variety of roles. Early in her career, her accurate, silvery coloratura made her an ideal Queen of the Night in Mozart's "Magic Flute." Later, as her voice matured and grew more rounded, she made an affecting Pamina in the same work.         She sang all the major soprano roles in a Mozart cycle staged by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle in Cologne in the 1970's, and recorded many of them. She was also exceptional as both Sophie and the Marschallin in Strauss's "Rosenkavalier." But although Mozart and Strauss were specialties, Miss Popp's repertory also included everything from Handel oratorios and Mahler symphonies to Janacek, Puccini and Wagner operas. She was also an incomparably communicative recitalist. Her last performances were recitals in Vienna, Dresden and Frankfurt in late September and early October. Austrian Honors         Miss Popp was born in Uhorska Ves, Czechoslovakia, on Nov. 12, 1939. She studied at Bratislava Academy and made her professional debut in 1963 as the Queen of the Night at the National Theater in Bratislava. The same year she made her debut as Barbarina in Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro" at the Vienna State Opera, and remained a mainstay of that company's roster for the rest of her life. She was honored several times by the Austrian Government (she held an Austrian passport), which gave her the title Kammersangerin.         Also in 1963, Miss Popp made her first appearance at the Salzburg Festival, and made her first important recording, a "Magic Flute" conducted by Otto Klemperer. A debut at Covent Garden followed in 1966, and in 1967 she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as the Queen of the Night. Her other Met roles include Sophie and Pamina.         Miss Popp made more than 75 recordings. Among those available on compact disk are Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito" (Philips Records), "The Magic Flute" (Angel); Beethoven's "Fidelio" (Deutsche Grammophon); Janacek's "Cunning Little Vixen" and "Jenufa" (both on London); Donizetti's "Elisir d'Amore" (RCA); two recordings of Johann Strauss Jr.'s "Fledermaus" (Angel and Deutsche Grammophon), and Strauss's "Rosenkavalier" (Sony Classical), "Daphne," "Intermezzo" and "Four Last Songs" (Angel).         She is survived by her husband, the tenor Peter Sieffert, and her father.       
         Phyllis C. Coffey, a philanthropist who supported many causes in New York City and Israel, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A resident of Manhattan, she was believed to be in her late 80's.         She had been ill for several months and died of natural causes, a hospital spokeswoman said.         With her husband, Lee, an insurance executive, Mrs. Coffey was a major contributor to the Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center and its Brenner Pavilion and to Mount Sinai Medical Center, where the couple established the Phyllis and Lee Coffey Outpatient Geriatrics Clinic and the Phyllis and Lee Coffey Non-Invasive Cardiology Area.         Other beneficiaries included Long Island Hospital, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. The couple also helped found the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra and Boys Town Jerusalem, and they sponsored a clinic for hemophiliacs at Tel Hashamir Hospital in Jerusalem.         Mrs. Coffey's husband died in June. She is survived by a niece, Hannah H. Schneider.       
         Marie Blake, a scat singer and stride pianist whose renditions of show tunes and jazz entertained lovers of popular music for 40 years in Greenwich Village, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         For 22 years, Miss Blake was the featured performer at the Five Oaks Restaurant, 49 Grove Street, at Bleecker Street, and for 19 years before that, she entertained nearby at another piano bar, Marie's Crisis.         On any given night, her repertory might range from cozy interpretations of Cole Porter rendered with a throaty purr, to a wake-'em-up "Rag Mop."         Miss Blake had a following of hundreds, if not thousands, of people who believed that listening to a live musician at 3 A.M. in a smoke-filled cafe was a major part of what living in Manhattan was all about. Her banter and ad-libbed one-liners endeared her to two generations of club audiences. The Songs She Felt         Miss Blake once said of her style: "When you sing a song, you have to sort of act it, too, to put it over to the people. You have to feel the song within you."         Among her standards, some of which were released on the 1986 album "Ain't Nobody's Bizness!" were "Miss Otis Regrets," "Honeysuckle Rose," "It Don't Mean a Thing" and "A-Flat Boogie Woogie." She also played calypso music, blues, songs from Broadway shows and whatever else suited her mood.         Miss Blake was born in Moorestown, N.J. She began her performing career at 16 during the Depression with a pickup band on Long Island, playing at country clubs, private parties and eventually college dances along the East Coast.         Moving to Manhattan in the early 1940's, she gained recognition as a member of the Harlem stride piano school, whose headliners were Art Tatum and Fats Waller. She later appeared in the 52d Street clubs with the Duke Ellington and Count Basie bands, and she sang alongside stars like Billie Holiday.         Miss Blake was the featured entertainer at the Cafe Society Club in midtown before moving her act to the Sheridan Square area, where she remained for the rest of her career.
