         Harriet Van Horne, a pioneer radio and television critic whose tough-minded crusades for educational programming and against ''women's chatter programs, the vulgar outpourings of the soap opera and the bad taste of commercials'' attracted a wide following in The New York World-Telegram and other Scripps-Howard newspapers for a quarter of a century, died on Thursday at New York Hospital.         She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Van Horne, who later wrote a syndicated column for The New York Post, died of breast cancer, said a friend, Leslie Rubinstein.         Ms. Van Horne liked to say she got into television criticism ''the day they invented it.'' Jack Gould of The New York Times; John Crosby, the syndicated columnist of The New York Herald Tribune, and Ms. Van Horne were the early critics most admired and feared in the late 1940's and early 50's.         In those days many programs originated in New York and were broadcast live. It came to be known as television's golden age, but she remembered it as a less precious metal.         In 1976 she was interviewed by Nora Ephron for Esquire. Ms. Ephron asked her to think about all the years she had spent listening to the radio and watching television.         She liked radio well enough, she said, until it occurred to her that by thinking and writing about it, she had become ''as dull and as intellectually sterile as everybody else in the radio business.''         But when she considered her work in television, it made radio programming look positively metaphysical.         ''It destroyed me,'' Ms. Van Horne said. ''I did a television column for 20 years, five columns a week, and I was always in a little screening room in the afternoon and at the television set at night. My reading program went to hell. Had I stayed in television, it would have killed me. Imagine reviewing 'I Love Lucy' 20 times. Imagine reviewing 'Gunsmoke' 20 times. It would rot anybody's brain.''         In later years she had fond memories of shows like ''Playhouse 90'' especially when she compared it with ''all the canned shows from Universal and all the crime and cowboys and so on.''         Later in her career, Ms. Van Horne became a syndicated columnist for The New York Post, writing about almost anything three times a week. The column contained the old wit and graceful prose that her readers had prized, but it was not picked up by many papers in syndication because it could not be categorized.         ''It's really not totally suitable for the editorial page because it's often frivolous and womanish,'' she told Ms. Ephron. ''On the other hand, it is often serious in a political sense and therefore, not entirely right for the women's page.''         Harriet Van Horne was born in Syracuse on May 17, 1920, and graduated from the College for Women of the University of Rochester in 1940.         She got her first full-time newspaper job at The Greenwich Time in Connecticut, by running an ad in Editor and Publisher that began, ''Blue-eyed blonde with a nose for news and a way with words, fresh out of college.''         Scoops were important in those days, and one of hers was a story and pictures of one of the playboy Tommy Manville's many brief marriages. It helped her get a job at The World-Telegram.         In her long career, she also wrote for The World Journal Tribune, Newsday, The New York Times Syndicate and The Los Angeles Times Entertainment Syndicate and was a frequent guest on television programs.         Ms. Van Horne was married to David Lowe, a documentary producer who died several years ago. She is survived by her sisters, Helen Van Graffeiland of Rochester and Ida Schatzle of Floral City, Fla.         In 1972, she published ''Never Go Anywhere Without a Pencil,'' a collection of her published essays. In it, she summed up in a few words her view of the newspaper business: ''We love newspapers the way a plain woman loves a charming, no-good husband.''       
         Ellen Scripps Davis, a horse breeder and granddaughter of the newspaper publisher Edward Wyllis Scripps, died on Feb. 8 in a fire at her home in San Diego. She was 84.         Her husband, Everett Conley Davis, 83, was also killed in the fire.         Though less involved in the newspaper business than her grandfather, who founded the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain and United Press International, Ms. Scripps Davis maintained links to the publishing industry. She and her brother James helped administer the Scripps League Newspapers, which at one time included dozens of local newspapers across the country. The company was sold to the Pulitzer Publishing Company in 1996.         Ms. Scripps Davis and her daughter Michelle Macfarlane were among the top-ranked mother-daughter teams nationally in horse breeding and training. Ms. Scripps Davis was president of the California Saddle Horse Breeders Association.         Her husband was retired from his law practice.         Ms. Scripps Davis is survived by her daughters, Ms. Macfarlane, of San Diego, and Victoria Greene of Los Angeles.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Hilda Morley, an American poet who gained wider recognition late in life, decades after she first published her imagist free verse, died on Monday at Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. A former resident of Sag Harbor, N.Y., she was 81 and had moved to London last year to continue work on a biography of her late husband, the avant-garde composer Stefan Wolpe.         The cause was liver failure after a fall at home, said a spokeswoman for her publisher, Moyer Bell.         Ms. Morley published five books of poetry in which she articulated emotions and feelings in free verse, but a type of verse as measured as dance  or music. She was a ''master of that ability,'' Robert Creeley, a fellow poet, said.         She wrote that her poetry was shaped by the visions of Abstract Expressionism, which can create metamorphoses. Artists like Klee and Picasso, she said, gave her the means to create word canvases depicting the world around her.         Born Hilda Auerbach in Manhattan, Ms. Morley considered herself an inhabitant of the world. She was educated in New York, Haifa (in what was then known as Palestine), London and at Wellesley College, Ohio State University and New York University.         Along the way she taught English at a private school in England and at Walden School in New York, where she also worked as a researcher for the Zionist Youth Commission and as a Hebrew translator for the Office of War Information.         Starting in the 1940's, she intermittently lectured at Rutgers University. After her marriage in 1952, she taught English literature at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Once recognized as a poet, she took academic assignments, lecturing, leading poetry workshops and judging poetry. She was a resident poet at Northeast Missouri University in 1992.         Ms. Morley is survived by a stepdaughter, Katherina Wolpe of London.         The first collection of her previously published poetry was ''A Blessing Outside Us'' (1976). It was followed by three others that remain in print: ''What Are Winds and What Are Waters'' (1993), ''To Hold in My Hand: Selected Poems, 1953-83'' (1984) and ''Cloudless at First'' (1988).         Her final collection was ''The Turning,'' which has just been published. It includes ''Fiesta, Ibiza,'' her evocation of a place she savored:         Warm crystal         of my little         city;         the fishes         swim over the bay,         rooftops swooping         with light,         the wreaths & garlands         bursting gently         in night's element,         the sunlit branches         exploding         softly,         the sea baring         its lights         burning         the unshadowed joys       
         Laila Twigg-Smith, an art collector and philanthropist, died on March 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 53 and had recently moved to Manhattan from Honolulu.         The cause was liver failure, said Christopher English Walling, a friend.         A trustee of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, she was also a member of its capital campaign steering and accessions committees, and was particularly involved in planning the new bookstore that opened as part of the museum's recent renovation. She was a member of the national committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art and of its painting and sculpture committee. In 1991 she won the Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Award from the Skowhegan School in Maine.         Ms. Twigg-Smith, who had been married to Thurston Twigg-Smith, former publisher of The Honolulu Advertiser, had lived since 1970 in Hawaii, where she and her husband had put together a substantial collection of contemporary art. They divorced two years ago.         She was instrumental in starting the Contemporary Arts Center in Honolulu and was active as an exhibition juror, lecturer, curator and teacher there. From 1980 to 1985 she was Commissioner of Visual Arts for the City and County of Honolulu. In the 1970's she wrote art reviews for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin.         She was also an artist with a particular interest in the print media and had studied art in college in California and later in Hawaii. She was known in the art world as a charismatic figure, with a sharp and enthusiastic eye for new art.         She is survived by a son, Cade Roster, of Honolulu.       
         Dorothy Spence Briley, the editor in chief and publisher of Clarion Books and a vice president of the trade and reference division of the Houghton Mifflin Company, died last Sunday at her home in New York City. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Karen Spence.         Mrs. Briley was born in Nashville and graduated from Vanderbilt University. She worked first at the Methodist Publishing House in Nashville, then in 1962 joined its children's department, Abingdon Press, in New York City. She later worked at Viking Press and E. P. Dutton, then led the children's departments at Van Nostrand, J. P. Lippincott and Lothrop, Lee & Shepard.         She moved to Clarion in 1989. In recent years, Clarion titles have won the Newbery and Caldecott Medals, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award and the Hans Christian Andersen Award. Mrs. Briley edited the acclaimed biographies by Russell Freedman and illustrated books by David Wiesner and Jim Murphy, among others.         Mrs. Briley's two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by a son, Michael Spence of New York, and a grandson.       
         Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five  million copies, died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris. She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ''I Know How to Cook.''         In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain ring of defiance, and no wonder.         Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the restrictions from the beginning.         If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen.         Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.         She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline.         By her own account Miss Mathiot  garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't and bowed to her family's wishes.         After she established a life and career away from her family, the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them, she said, though for reasons of her own.         If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine.         While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science, including advances in nutritional understanding.         When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down, Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot, who said yes.         Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.         In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.         Like ''The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ''I Know How to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.         A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate survivors, never took anything for granted.         Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment, would have one more instruction: turn off the oven.       
         Erika Cheetham, an English medieval scholar who made a fortune translating the predictions of the 16th-century physician and astrologer Nostradamus, who gazed not only at the stars but also, legend had it, into a brass bowl of water to see visions of the future, died on May 3 in London. She was 58.         Her books, ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' ''The Further Prophecies of Nostradamus'' and ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' in which she claimed to have found predictions of the execution of  Charles I, the Great Fire of London, the Apollo 13 catastrophe and the spread of AIDS, sold in the millions.         They were on mass-market paperback best-seller lists for years in the United States, Britain and other countries, and, since the first book appeared in 1973, they have never been out of print.         Her good fortune came about because of a mistake at the Taylorian Library at Oxford, where she was working toward a doctorate in medieval languages. The librarian gave her the wrong book, the ''Propheties de M. Nostradamus.'' She found it fascinating and saw in it what she interpreted to be a prediction of World War II.         Michel de Notredame, the astrologer's real name, was also a traveling doctor from Provence, doing what was regarded as heroic work during plagues in Aix-en-Provence and Lyons. He produced several almanacs and a book of rhymed prophecies called ''Centuries,'' which has stayed in print through 300 editions. Before  his death in 1566, he had gained a wide following.         In the 33d quatrain of his fifth set of predictions, for example, a passage on the city of Nantes read: ''The city's leaders in revolt, will in the name of liberty, slaughter its inhabitants without regard to age or sex. There will be screams and howls and piteous sights.'' Two centuries later this was interpreted as a prophecy of the drownings of Nantes under the Committee of Public Safety in 1793.         But being a closet Lutheran in a time of the Inquisitions held to punish heretics, most of Nostradamus's prophesies were cryptic and written in a mix of archaic French, Latin, Greek, Italian or English. Translators contended that the quatrains contained codes, anagrams, hints and fragments of meaning that, put together, were predictions of coming events. A reference to a figure named Hister was taken as code for Hitler.         Erika McMahon-Turner was born in London on July 7, 1939, a daughter of wealthy parents, Eric A. Turner, Under Secretary to the Admiralty, and Helen Lilian McMahon Turner.  She attended a convent school but was expelled for writing an essay contending that God did not exist. She had an interest even then in the paranormal and the prophetic. Later, on gaining acceptance to St. Anne's College, Oxford, she cut a stylish, aristocratic figure, someone who went riding with the Aga Khan and married a Grenadier Guard, James Nicholas Milne Cheetham.         After receiving her Ph.D. she became a staff writer for The London Daily Mail. She wrote an article on Nostradamus in 1961 and two years later began translating his work in earnest.         Her first book appeared in 1965 and became an immediate hit, as did the other two. Her publishers at Corgi Books were now excited about Nostradamus as well. ''A very profitable business to be in,'' one was quoted as saying. ''Every publisher should have a Nostradamus title on their lists. And the beauty of it is that if you get one of Nostradamus's predictions wrong, you can always remove it from the next edition.''         Indeed, at the start of the 1990's at least 10 Nostradamus titles were in print, and with the advent of the Persian Gulf war, bookstores in Britain and the United States were selling out, with total sales tripling in some cases.         Ms. Cheetham, however, was ambivalent about the perspicacity of her hero. Claiming to be a linguist, a scholar and a skeptic, she once said: ''It's all rubbish, you know. Some of it is so vague and tortured and you could bend all sorts of events to fit.''         At other times she projected conviction: ''It's a question of all the portents coming together,'' she said in 1985, ''a pope with two attempts on his life, two brothers assassinated in the U.S.A. and the advent of Halley's comet.''         In her periods of skepticism, she was not alone. ''In a respectable London bookshop last week,'' wrote Francis Wheen in The Guardian in 1996, ''I was astonished to find an entire section given over to works by or about Nostradamus, the mumbo-jumbo merchant.'' The likely explanation, he said, was superstition linked to the approach of the year 2000.         Other nonbelievers in the more distant past included the Catholic Church, which in 1781 put ''Centuries'' on its index of condemned books.         Ms. Cheetham also wrote the screenplay of the 1982 film ''The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which Orson Welles played Nostradamus, and she was a contributor to periodicals and encyclopedias.         She was divorced in 1980, and is survived by a son, Alexander M. Cheetham.       
         Kay Thompson, an entertainer who became the author of the hugely successful book ''Eloise,'' about a bratty child living at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, died on Thursday. She lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with her goddaughter, Liza Minnelli. She was taken from the apartment to Lenox Hill Hospital, but her longtime lawyer Arthur E. Abelman said it was unclear where she died. She was between 92 and 95,  Mr. Abelman, estimated.         The daughter of a St. Louis jeweler, Ms. Thompson was a pianist with the St. Louis Symphony in 1928.  ''I was a stage-struck kid,'' she recalled later, ''and I got out of St. Louis fast.''         She became a singer with the Mills Brothers on radio, an arranger and singer with Fred Waring's Band and co-producer of ''Kay Thompson and Company,'' a CBS radio show. She also worked as an arranger and songwriter for ''The Ziegfeld Follies'' and other movies, and performed in nightclubs, singing with the Williams Brothers from 1947 to 1953.         As The New York Herald Tribune reported in 1958, ''Eloise's birth was unexpected. At rehearsals of her act with the Williams Brothers, Ms. Thompson prized punctuality. Then one day she was late. In a high, childish voice that she had never used before, she made her apology. One of her co-workers said, 'Who are you, little girl?' Ms. Thompson replied, 'I am Eloise. I am 6.' The others joined in the game, each assuming a juvenile identity, and it became a regular rehearsal pastime.'' The routine became a book after Ms. Thompson began performing in 1954 in a one-woman show at the Plaza.         While she was appearing in the hotel's Persian Room, she was introduced to an artist, Hilary Knight, and he became the illustrator of ''Eloise,'' which was subtitled ''A Book for Precocious Grown Ups.'' Ms. Thompson wrote the book during a three-month break from performing.         Later she wrote three other books about Eloise, which were also illustrated by Mr. Knight.         In the first two years after ''Eloise'' came out, 150,000 copies were sold. Looking back in 1957, Publisher's Weekly said: ''As everyone who can read must know, Eloise is an overprivileged 6-year-old, the terror of the Hotel Plaza in New York. She is also ill-mannered, ill-tempered and ugly. But she has her charm. She often means well, and her mother neglects her. Even though you know that you would do the same thing if she were yours, you can't help finding this appealing.''         Kim Bouchard, a senior publicist at Simon & Schuster, Ms. Thompson's publisher, said that according to records beginning in 1983, 592,000 copies of ''Eloise'' have been sold in the United States since 1983.         The other Eloise books are ''Eloise in Paris'' (1957), ''Eloise at Christmastime'' (1958) and ''Eloise in Moscow'' (1959).         Ms. Thompson also wrote ''Kay Thompson's Miss Pooky Peckinpaugh and Her Secret Private Boyfriends Complete with Telephone Numbers'' (1970).         Ms. Thompson founded Eloise Ltd., which made recordings and other products related to the Eloise character. She also acted in movies, including ''Funny Face,'' and on television.         Friends said her first marriage, in the 1930's, to Jack Jenney, a trombonist, ended in divorce, as did her later marriage to William Spier, a radio producer.       
         Lillian Hoban, who illustrated or wrote more than 100 children's books, including those featuring a badger named Frances and a chimpanzee named Arthur, died on July 17 at New York and Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and in Wilton, Conn.         The cause was heart failure, said her principal publisher, HarperCollins Children's Books.         Ms. Hoban's best-known works explored the trials and tribulations of early childhood. She first established herself as an illustrator in the 1960's, providing the drawings for the ''Frances'' series written by her husband, Russell Hoban, a prolific author of children's books. She illustrated his ''Baby Sister for Frances'' (1964) and drew the pictures for five more books in that series about Frances and her family.         After the couple divorced in 1975, she began writing and illustrating an ''I Can Read Books'' series about Arthur and his little sister, Violet. An 11th title, ''Arthur's Birthday Party,'' is due out early next year.         Born in Philadelphia, Lillian Aberman Hoban attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, studied dance with Martha Graham and taught modern dance in New York and Connecticut. She also danced on television during the 1950's.         She taught herself to draw still lifes, using crayons and pastels, and started writing stories after she had her own children, basing her tales on their everyday adventures.         Ms. Hoban is survived by three daughters, Phoebe, and Julia, both  of Manhattan, and Esme, of Wilton; a son, Brom, of Austin, Tex.; a sister, Esther Man of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.         Ms. Hoban was active in civic affairs in Wilton, particularly at the Wilton Library.         She also played a prominent role in the National Arts Club's creative writing program for public-school children, hoping to whet their taste for reading and writing.         ''When I am writing, I like writing best, and when I am drawing, I like drawing best,'' she once said. ''But probably what I like better than anything is just messing around with color.''       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.
