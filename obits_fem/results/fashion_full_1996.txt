         Isabel Kambert, an opera singer who escaped Nazi Germany with liverwurst sandwiches stuffed with folded 10,000-mark notes, and who later in New York became known as Mme. Isabel after creating the fashion for decorated cashmere sweaters, died on Wednesday at the home of a niece, Eva Ballantine, in Kingston, N.Y.         Mrs. Kambert was 103.         She was well known in German and Paris opera houses in the 1930's until, unwilling to join the Nazi party, she was banned from performing. She left Germany in 1938 on an overnight train to Paris, carrying one small bag and a box of tiny sandwiches.         She often told friends that at the border, flirtatious guards asked if they could have one of her sandwiches, and when they persisted, she fended them off with: "Oh, no, you wouldn't want one of these. They're kosher." The sandwiches apparently lost their appeal.         When she reached New York shortly after, suitable opera roles were in short supply and she took a job for a time decorating cashmere sweaters, using embroidery, beading or ribbons as embellishment. The shop was run by three Russian emigres: Karinska, who later became known for her ballet costumes; Princess Natasha Paley, and Baron Nicholas de Gunzberg, who went on to senior editorial positions at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue magazines.         Mrs. Kambert later opened her own business as part of the custom house of Chez Ninon and, for a brief period, was associated with Saks Fifth Avenue. In the 1960's, she operated independently in the Lombardy Hotel.         Her customers included Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who bought a sweater during a visit to New York, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, Doris Duke, the Duchess of Windsor and Greta Garbo.         One of eight children of Hugo Heermann, a German violinist who was discovered by Rossini at age 9 and who introduced several Brahms compositions, Mrs. Kambert was born in Frankfurt in 1892. She was married and widowed four times.       
         Marie-Helene de Rothschild, one of Europe's most imaginative hostesses, whose activities were a major part of the Paris social season for many years, died on  Friday at her home in Ferrieres, 20 miles northeast of Paris. She was 65 and had suffered for three decades from an incurable degenerative arthritic ailment.         Baroness de Rothschild, whose husband, Baron Guy de Rothschild, is dean of the French branch of the banking family, was well known in the world of fashion  and was particularly renowned for the dinners, balls and benefits she organized. Many were held at Chateau Ferrieres, the former Rothschild mansion that now belongs to the French state. The house in which the Baroness died was built on the estate after the chateau had been given to the Government.         The Baroness, who enjoyed creating fantasies for her social occasions, once  greeted 150 guests at a dinner (Diner de Tetes Surrealistes, whose invitations had to be read in a mirror) dressed as a stag at the kill, with a mask of towering antlers and pear-shaped diamond "tears" on her face.         At a ball she gave at Ferrieres for 1,600 people, the chateau was covered in  white muslin to make it look like a huge diamond-studded cobweb. A gala for the  Paris Ballet transformed the Palais Garnier into a woodland, with trees and vines climbing to the ceiling. At another function, her Bal Proust, celebrating  the 100th anniversary of Marcel Proust's birth, Cecil Beaton took guests' photographic portraits.         "When she has made up her mind about something, there is nothing on earth that can deter her," her husband once said.         The daughter of Baron Egmont van Zuylen de Nyevelt de Haar, a Dutch diplomat, and an Egyptian mother, the Baroness was educated at Marymount College in New York.         On a trip to Paris shortly after leaving school, she met and married Count Francois de Nicolay. They were divorced six years later after she had met Baron  de Rothschild and he, too, had decided to obtain a divorce. The Rothschilds were married in 1957 in a civil ceremony in New York -- "to allow the tempest we had  stirred up by a double divorce to subside a little," the Baroness once recalled.         After Ferrieres was donated to the Government, the Baroness did most of her entertaining at her Paris residence, the 18th-century Hotel Lambert on Ile St.-Louis. Her guests included a cross-section of international society, business and the arts -- the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor, Yves Saint Laurent, Oscar de la Renta and Andy Warhol.         "A good way of making people happy is to allow them to meet their opposites," she once said.         Nan Kempner, a New York socialite and a longtime friend, said, "She had enormous intelligence and curiosity and she wanted to see and do everything."         When France nationalized Banque Rothschild in 1981, the Baron moved to New York for a short time. Although the Baroness's illness made traveling difficult, she worked with an interior decorator on refurbishing their Upper East Side apartment.         The Baroness was also a major supporter of French couture and for many years  was in the front row at important shows. She was president of the committee that organized the 1973 Divertissement a Versailles, an event at which American designers were not only introduced to Europeans but also upstaged their French counterparts.         Survivors include her husband; two sons, Philippe de Nicolay, and Edouard de  Rothschild of Paris; a stepson, David de Rothschild of Paris, and a brother, Teddy van Zuylen of London.       
         Anne McDonnell Ford Johnson, who served on the White House Fine Arts Committee during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, helped restore Blair House in Washington and played an active role in social and charitable events in New York, died Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 76.         Her death was due to complications from a stroke, her daughter Charlotte Ford said.         Mrs. Johnson was divorced from the late Henry Ford 2d, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, in 1964. She married Deane F. Johnson, a prominent Los Angeles lawyer, in 1968 and the couple moved to New York in 1980.         One of 14 children in the prominent New York family of James F. McDonnell, Mrs. Johnson was born in Rye, N.Y., and grew up in a duplex apartment in Manhattan and on the 55-acre family estate in Southampton. Her grandfather, Thomas E. Murray, was a utilities executive and inventor.         Mrs. Johnson attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Noroton, Conn., and  the Grattanelli School in Sienna, Italy. She met Mr. Ford while returning from a European trip in 1936, and they were married in 1940 in what was a major event of the Southampton social season. The service was conducted by the Most Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, then a monsignor, who had instructed Mr. Ford in Roman Catholicism before his conversion.         During her years in Grosse Pointe, Mich., she was active in the support of the Detroit Institute of Art and the Metropolitan Opera Association of Detroit. She was also one of the first women elected to the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1956, she was selected as one of the 10 best-dressed women in the world and four years later was named to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         The announcement of the Ford separation and divorce followed months of rumor  in which Mr. Ford was linked romantically to the Italian-born Maria Cristina Vettore Austin, the divorced wife of a British naval officer. Mr. Ford and Mrs.  Austin were married in 1965.         Shortly after her divorce, Mrs. Ford, who had moved to Manhattan, was with a  friend having a cup of espresso at the Regency Hotel. She noticed Mrs. Austin, who was with a friend at another table. "This had to happen some time," she whispered to her companion. "I think the only gracious thing is to go over and say hello. You know I've never met her." The two went over, introduced themselves and shook hands. Mrs. Ford's friend later reported: "It was all very  civilized, but if there were a way to bottle up the electricity in that little room, it would run the Ford industries for a solid year."         After her marriage to Mr. Johnson, to whom she was introduced by Rocky Converse, the widow of Gary Cooper, Mrs. Johnson created an instant status revolution in Los Angeles, where she immediately became the most prestigious hostess. The couple bought a Regency-style house that Mrs. Johnson, who was known as a connoisseur of French furniture, filled with the pieces she had collected. She eventually became the Los Angeles representative of Christie's, the international auction house. Later, in New York, she was associated for a time with Sotheby's.         Survivors include Mr. Johnson, two daughters, Charlotte Ford of Manhattan and Anne Ford of Southampton and Manhattan; a son, Edsel B. Ford 2d of Grosse Pointe; five sisters, Katherine Sullivan of Arizona, Mary Murnane and Margie Murphy of Florida, Barbara Hennessey of Connecticut and Sheila Collins of California; two brothers, Morgan McDonnell of Chicago and Jim McDonnell of Detroit, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Josephine DeNatale Butler, a dance educator, historian and author, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Mrs. Butler and her husband, Albert Butler, wrote "The Encyclopedia of Social Dance." She was also the founder and president of the Institute for Social Dance Studies in New York, dedicated to the preservation and documentation of the history of American social dancing.         In 1970, Mrs. Butler created the film, print and memorabilia archive of American social ballroom dancing at the dance division of the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts. For 50 years, she was the director of the Albert Butler School of Dance, which she and her husband founded in 1936.         The Butlers were a popular ballroom dance team for many years, performing in  Manhattan at the Ritz-Carlton, the Plaza and other hotels, as well as in Europe.         Mrs. Butler was born in New York City in 1911. Before taking up dance, she was a fashion consultant and high-fashion designer. She was a past president of  the International Dance Council and Dance Masters of America.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Janet A. Sloane, a fashion director who helped bring haute couture headware from Europe to upscale American stores, died on April 20 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 82.         Beginning in the early 1940's, Ms. Sloane was a stylist, scout and vice president of Madcaps Inc., a Manhattan millinery and accessories company founded by her brother and partner, Alfred Z. Solomon. She worked there until Mr. Solomon sold the business in 1992.         As president of Madcaps International, Ms. Sloane was a regular at fashion shows in Europe, Tokyo and Hong Kong, where she sought new trends in designs, colors and fabrics.  She was among the first to adapt the millinery designs of Givenchy, Yves St. Laurent and other Europeans for the American market.         Ms. Sloane was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College in 1934. She was a supporter of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its Costume Institute. She was also a conservator of the New York Public Library and a member of the Corporation of Yaddo, the artists' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She was a founding member of the Fashion Group International and the Fashion  Round Table, two organizations for industry executives, and a member of the Soroptomists, an international women's community service alliance.         She is survived by her brother.       
         The badly decomposed body of the actress and model Margaux Hemingway, who was once described as the face of a generation, was discovered by friends yesterday  in her home in Santa Monica, Calif., the police said.         Santa Monica police investigators arrived at Ms. Hemingway's studio apartment at 1:52 P.M. after the body's discovery, said Sgt. Gary Gallinot, a department spokesman.         Ms. Hemingway, 41, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, had not been seen since Friday and friends were concerned, the sergeant said. He said there were no signs of forced entry or foul play.         The friends, whose names were not released by the police, grew worried when Ms. Hemingway did not respond to knocks on the door. They asked a laborer working in the neighborhood to get a ladder so they could enter the home through a balcony, Sergeant Gallinot said.         Officials of the Los Angeles coroner's office said the body was so decomposed that immediate identification was difficult and the police initially would only  confirm the body was that of a woman. The cause of death will be determined through an autopsy. Identity was made through dental records.         Ms. Hemingway had recently moved into a studio apartment on quiet, leafy street near the beach.         Her agent, David Mirisch, told CNN that she had recently finished a Westinghouse television series narrating an animal show, called "The Wild Guide."         She had struggled publicly with alcoholism and bulimia and was treated at the Betty Ford Center in 1988. She made her screen debut in the "Lipstick" in 1976,  opposite her younger sister, Mariel. The film, which got negative reviews, was about a young model who was raped then humiliated when a jury acquitted the defendant.         The lucrative movie contract was preceded by a successful modeling career, which began with the urging of a former husband, Errol Wetson, the former owner  and co-founder of Wetson hamburgers, a fast-food restaurant chain.         Joe Eula, the New York fashion artist, said in 1975 that Ms. Hemingway had "the face of a generation, as recognizable and memorable as Lisa Fonssagrives and Jean Shrimpton."         Later that year, she would garner what New Yorker magazine called, "the largest single advertising contract ever involving a female personality," when she signed a $1 million contract to become spokeswoman for Babe, a fragrance line developed by Faberge.         Born in Portland, Oregon in 1955, Ms. Hemingway, was the second of the three  daughters of John and Byra Hemingway. She was said to have changed her name from Margot when she learned that her parents drank a bottle of Chateau Margaux on the night of her conception.         The family spent several years on Ernest Hemingway's farm in Cuba. They then  moved to San Francisco, where her father worked as a stockbroker. In 1967, the family moved once again to mountainous Ketchum, Idaho, where Ernest Hemingway committed suicide six years earlier.       
         The badly decomposed body of the actress and model Margaux Hemingway, who was once described as the face of a generation, was discovered by friends on Monday  in her home in Santa Monica, Calif., the police said. She was 41.         Santa Monica police investigators arrived at Ms. Hemingway's apartment at 1:52 P.M., said Sgt. Gary Gallinot, a department spokesman. Ms. Hemingway, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, had not been seen since Friday, and friends were concerned, the sergeant said. He said there were no signs of forced entry or foul play.         A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office, Fred Corral, said yesterday that autopsy results would not be available for about two weeks but that a preliminary investigation pointed to death by "apparent natural causes,"  possibly linked to Ms. Hemingway's history of epilepsy. Ms. Hemingway had also struggled publicly with alcoholism and bulimia.         When Ms. Hemingway did not respond to phone calls or knocks on the door, friends asked a laborer working in the neighborhood to get a ladder so they could enter the home through a balcony, Sergeant Gallinot said. Ms. Hemingway had recently moved into the studio apartment near the beach.         Her agent, David Mirisch, told CNN that she had recently finished narrating a series on animals.         Tall, blond and glamorous, Ms. Hemingway achieved nearly instant renown in the 1970's as a supermodel. She began her career at the urging of a former husband, Errol Wetson, a film producer and a founder and former owner of the Wetson hamburger chain.         Joe Eula, the New York fashion artist, said in 1975 that Ms. Hemingway had "the face of a generation, as recognizable and memorable as Lisa Fonssagrives and Jean Shrimpton."         Later that year, she signed what The New Yorker called "the largest single advertising contract ever involving a female personality." The $1 million contract made her the spokeswoman for Babe, a fragrance line developed by Faberge.         She made her screen debut in "Lipstick" in 1976, opposite her younger sister, Mariel. The film, which received negative reviews, was about a young model who seeks vengeance after she is raped, then humiliated when a jury acquits the defendant. Ms. Hemingway's acting career faltered, while her sister fared better, appearing in films like Woody Allen's "Manhattan."         Ms. Hemingway was born in Portland, Ore., in 1955, the second of the three daughters of John Hadley and Byra Whitlock Hemingway. She was said to have changed her name from Margot when she learned that her parents drank Chateau Margaux on the night of her conception.         The family spent several years on Ernest Hemingway's farm in Cuba. They then  moved to San Francisco, where her father was a stockbroker. In 1967, the family  moved to mountainous Ketchum, Idaho, where Ernest Hemingway had committed suicide six years earlier.         Ms. Hemingway's two marriages, first to Mr. Wetson, then to Bernardo Faucher, a French-born film maker, ended in divorce.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her father and stepmother.       
         Nanette Bearden, the founder and artistic director of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater, died on Aug. 10 at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island. She was 69 and had homes in Manhattan and on St. Martin in the French West Indies.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Dorothy Dow, a sister.         Ms. Bearden was an energetic supporter of fledgling black choreographers and small modern-dance companies and produced their work in a series, Broadway Dance Festival, in 1975 and 1976. Her own modern-dance company, founded in 1976 as the Chamber Dance Group, presented simple stage productions for dances by black choreographers who included Walter Rutledge, Gary DeLoatch, Walter Raines, William Scott and Roumel Reaux. The company also performed dances by such leading choreographers as Alvin Ailey, Talley Beatty, Fred Benjamin, George Faison and Dianne McIntyre.         Born on Staten Island, Ms. Bearden studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and was a model with the Ophelia DeVore Agency. She trained in dance at the Martha Graham school, at Clark Center and at the Luigi Dance Center and performed from 1971 to 1974 with the New World Dancers. She was also a promoter of visual arts in the French West Indies.         Ms. Bearden's husband, the artist Romare Bearden, died in 1988. Besides Mrs. Dow, she is survived by six other sisters, Evelyn Jackson and Marie, Sheila and Delores Rohan, all of Staten Island and St. Martin; Annette Rohan of Bellflower, Calif., and Gloria Elboushi of Long Beach, Calif.       
         Martha Phillips, a notable force in luxury fashion retailing for more than 60 years and an early supporter of many of today's leading designers, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98.         Martha, as she was generally known (Miss Martha to her employees), was for many years a well-known front-row figure at major fashion shows in New York and Europe and a booster of, among others, Valentino, Halston, Geoffrey Beene, James Galanos, Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and Zandra Rhodes at the beginning of their careers.         Her customers at her elegant Park Avenue and Palm Beach salons were some of the world's richest and most socially prominent women, who often filled in checks that ended in three and four zeros.         There were four Martha shops in the 1980's, when sales were said to be almost $40 million. A boutique in the Trump Tower closed after several years, and a bankruptcy filing in 1992, attributed to the economy, resulted in the shuttering of the Park Avenue salon and another in Bal Harbour, Fla. The Palm Beach shop, operated by Mrs. Phillips's daughter, Lynn Manulis, remains, and Mrs. Phillips went in almost daily until shortly before her death.         ''There was never anybody like her and there won't be anyone like her,'' Ms. Trigere said yesterday. The designer, who did business with Mrs. Phillips for almost a half-century, added, ''She developed a special knowledge of who her customer was -- from the very first client, she knew what she was doing.''         Mr. Beene described Mrs. Phillips as ''an icon to an audience of a more frivolous era of dressing -- steeped in vanity and femininity.''         And Mr. de la Renta called it ''the end of a whole era'' and Mrs. Phillips ''the last of the great ladies of retailing with a true grasp of the luxury business and a tremendous sense of quality.''         A small, meticulously groomed woman with carefully coiffed hair who wore signature David Webb jewelry, Mrs. Phillips did not hesitate to pop into fitting rooms as her customers tried on clothes. More often than not, she did not ask what they wanted but told them what they should have. More often than not, they listened. Although the salon had a workroom  for alterations, Mrs. Phillips also did not hesitate, on occasion, to get on her knees to pin a hem.         There was never a time when she was not fascinated by fashion, Mrs. Phillips said in a 1983 interview on the 50th anniversary of her business. Born Martha Rollins in Brooklyn, where her father had a shop called the Star that specialized in hand-tailored clothes and riding clothes, she asked to help in the business one day when she was 8. Her father got a crate, placed it behind the counter and she stood there after school, selling lace blouses.         ''People were so amused, they would buy,'' she recalled.         At 18, she married Phillip R. Phillips, a manufacturer of ready-to-wear clothing and in the early 1930's she opened a shop on the 12th floor of a Madison Avenue building. Despite the Depression, she refused to buy anything for the shop that would sell for less than $100.         ''I did very well,'' she said. Her customers included Marjorie Merriweather Post, who brought in her jewels to make certain that both the color and the neckline of the dress were appropriate for showing them off properly. Other clients were Doris Duke, Brooke Astor, Gloria Vanderbilt and Diana Ross.         Mrs. Phillips remained there for 20 years, leaving only when the building was torn down. She then leased space in what was the Savoy Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue. After that building was sold to the General Motors Corporation, she balked at a shop she was offered downstairs in the plaza of the new building to be built on the site, saying, ''Martha's customers never shop in cellars.''         Shortly after, she and her daughter, who joined her several years earlier, found a location at Park Avenue and 58th Street where in plush  surroundings she coddled her customers with tea and cookies while models paraded the clothes or saleswomen carried them out.         Mr. Phillips died in 1981. Besides  her daughter, who lives in Palm Beach, Mrs. Phillips is survived by a son, Herbert R. Phillips, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Milton Rollins of Brooklyn, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview when she was in her mid-80's, Mrs. Phillips, who was chairwoman of her company -- her daughter was president -- said she had no intention of ever retiring.         ''I like to think that what we're doing is being impresarios, finding talent,'' she said. ''I like the excitement.''       
         Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.         Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack.         The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.         The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.         ''We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay,'' she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: ''We stayed 19 years.''         By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.         Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.         How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.         Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.         In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.         Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.         Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.         But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called ''catalytic philanthropy,'' investments designed to bolster the state's economy.         In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.         What made such ''philanthropy,'' especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.         During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.         Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.         Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.         For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.         Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.         Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.         Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative ''catalytic philanthropy,'' that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.         In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.         Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Hildegarde Fillmore Smith, a former fashion and beauty editor at the women's magazine McCall's, died on Monday in her garret apartment at the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park South.         She was 98 and had lived at the club for the last 43 years.         A native of Cincinnati and a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, she came to New York City as an aspiring poet and settled into a career in publishing instead.         In addition to editing, she worked as a Hollywood correspondent. She also served on the Board of Governors of the Fashion Group and on the committee for the American Fashion Critics Award.         After retiring in 1953 she became active in the National Arts Club, editing its bulletin and serving as its  secretary for more than a decade.         She is survived by a sister, Chalma Mathewson of Cincinnati.       
         Greer Lankton, an artist known for her flamboyant doll-like sculptures, was found dead in her apartment in Chicago last Monday. She was 38.         An autopsy will be held to determine the cause of death, said her father, William Lankton of Park Forest, Ill.         Ms. Lankton, who had a sex-change operation in 1979, was born in Flint, Mich., in 1958 and was originally named Greg Robert Lankton. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and received a bachelor's of fine arts from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1981.         Her sculptures evolved from the dolls she had made since childhood. Beautifully sewn, with extravagant clothes, make-up and hairstyles, they were at once glamorous and grotesque and exuded intense, Expressionistic personalities that reminded some observers of Egon Schiele. They presaged many of the concerns of 90's art, including the emphasis on the body, sexuality, fashion and, in their resemblance to puppets, performance. Sometimes Ms. Lankton created elaborate settings for her figures, heightening their theatricality.         During the 1980's Ms. Lankton was part of the East Village art scene in Manhattan. She had solo shows at Civilian Warfare, a gallery on Avenue B, in 1983, '84 and '85, and was also a frequent subject of the photographer Nan Goldin. She is featured in Ms. Goldin's 1995 film ''I'll Be Your Mirror.'' Ms. Lankton moved back to Chicago in 1987, living and working in a small studio apartment filled with her figures. Last month an installation largely recreating this room, opened at the Mattress Factory, an alternative space in Pittsburgh. In 1995, Ms. Lankton's work was represented in the Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Venice Biennale.         In addition to her father, Ms. Lankton is survived by her mother, Lynn, also of Park Forest; a brother, Mark Alan, of Saugatuck, Mich., and a sister, Cathy, of Bellingham, Wash.       
         Suzanne Railey, a representative for Christie's auction house who was known for her talents as an international hostess, died last weekend in her Manhattan apartment. She was 85.         She died in her sleep, Ed Gallagher, a longtime friend, told Christie's. She had a list of guests for her next dinner party at her bedside, he said.         Ms. Railey, who was known as Sue, lived most of her life in Paris and New York, and had been employed by Christie's in New York since March 1985. She was a public relations ambassador of sorts. Her only  role for the auction house was to hold a black-tie dinner party at her home each month, drawing on her long list of wealthy and influential friends, many with extensive art collections. The idea was to generate good will, and eventually business, for the auction house.         Seated at the tables in her two bedroom apartment in the East 60's  would be diplomats, society doyennes and fashion designers.         ''It all depends who's in town and what I'm thinking about,'' Ms. Railey said during an interview last week.         The jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent dinner guest at her house, said: ''You never knew who you'd be seated next to. She always had good people. And her apartment was amazing, with more objects than you could count on every table and mirrors on the ceilings.''         Entertaining and collecting were what she enjoyed.         ''You must talk to me about dinner parties,'' Ms. Railey said, standing at Alexis Gregory's dinner party on Dec. 2, clutching a black pocketbook with a big white clock on top. ''I love them so much. It's just so much more attractive to entertain at home. You can actually sit and talk.''         Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's, said, ''Her apartment was filled with all these treasures of Europe.'' She collected portraits from the French Revolutionary period, miniatures and African works of art, and also had a large collection of letter seals.         She was born Suzanne Rosenberg in Rochester. Her family owned a department store. As a young girl she traveled to Manhattan, Washington and Paris with her parents, said David Granger, a longtime friend.         She lived in Manhattan during part of her 20's with an uncle, Ed Goodman, who owed Finchley's, a men's clothing store. Mr. Granger said, ''And she did what popular young girls do, she traveled and went to parties.''         Then she moved to Washington,  where she started Overcoats for Britain, a program shipping coats to England during World War II.         In 1950, she married Howard Barclay Railey, a businessman who was attached to the American Embassy in Paris. For the next 33 years, she lived and entertained in ''a romantic apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris,'' said Ethel de Croisset, a close friend who lives in Paris.         ''She was a born brilliant hostess,'' she said. ''She was always friends with all the ambassadors.'' When her husband died, Ms. Railey moved back to Manhattan and began working for Christie's.         She is survived by two stepsons.
