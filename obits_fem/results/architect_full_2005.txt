         Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.         Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov.         In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.         Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''         Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''         Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.         After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.         She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.         In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her.         In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.         Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.         She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women.         Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.       
         Naomi Leff, an interior designer who created elegant spaces for celebrities and retailers like Ralph Lauren, Ferragamo, Gucci, Giorgio Armani and Helena Rubinstein, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was complications of liver disease, her friend Barbara Ashley said.         She was not widely known by the public because she tended to work for wealthy, private customers. Among her residential clients were Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Barry Diller, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer, her firm said.         Ms. Leff first attracted wide attention in 1986, when she transformed the Rhinelander Mansion at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street, built in 1898, into the flagship store for Polo Ralph Lauren.         As a profile of Ms. Leff for The New York Times in 1989 reported, she pieced together the building from the few original plans that remained, uncovering the site of the original staircase, and ''designed a grand mahogany stair that looks as though it has always been there.'' Similarly, she had ornamental plasterwork recast from surviving fragments so that it, too, appeared original. Writing in 1992, Paul Goldberger, The Times's architectural critic, called this ''the most successful conversion of a New York house into a luxury emporium since Cartier took over the former Morton Plant residence on Fifth Avenue.'' He said it achieved ''just the right balance between beautiful objects for sale and beautiful objects placed to enhance the experience of being in a stage set.''         By that time, Ms. Leff had designed interiors for Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman and had worked from 1975 to 1980 as the senior designer for Bloomingdale's. She then designed interiors for yachts and private planes and the famously expensive Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort in Telluride, Colo.         Preferring what she called ''a modernist, minimalist aesthetic'' with occasional flourishes of Art Nouveau or Art Deco, she was able to capture almost any era or mood.         ''Architects tend to scorn interior decorators,'' said Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest, which published many articles about Ms. Leff's work and picked her as one of 30 or so Deans of Design in a recent issue. ''No architect scorned Naomi Leff, and she worked with some of the best.''         Ms. Leff was born on Aug. 4, 1939, in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, to Frank Leff, who worked for the American Jewish Committee, and Johanna Leff, a teacher in the New York City school system. She attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, then received a Bachelor of Science degree from SUNY Cortland and a master's in sociology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Her parents survive her.         After teaching elementary school in the New York City public school system for a few years, Ms. Leff enrolled at Pratt Institute, earning a master's in environment design with a minor in architecture. In 1980 she opened her own design office, Naomi Leff & Associates, concentrating at first on retail and residential design.         She took an all-encompassing approach. At Shearson Lehman Hutton's Saddle Ridge Conference Center in Beaver Creek, Colo., for example, she put together an extensive, museum-quality collection of American West antique furnishings and artifacts that is now considered one of the best of its kind. Ms. Leff also designed the company's planes, a Gulfstream III and a Gulfstream IV.       
         Uli Derickson, the Trans World Airlines flight attendant honored for saving passengers' lives in 1985 by both confronting and mollifying terrorist hijackers, died on Friday at her home in Tucson. She was 60.         Ms. Derickson was still working as a flight attendant for Delta Air Lines when she received a diagnosis of cancer in 2003, her son, Matthew Derickson, said in announcing her death.         On June 14, 1985, when a pair of Lebanese gunmen commandeered a T.W.A. flight from Athens to Rome, Ms. Derickson took the lead in protecting the 152 passengers and crew members.         Though the two hijackers spoke almost no English, Ms. Derickson was able to speak with one of them in German and occasionally calm him by singing a German ballad he requested. She won the hijackers' pity for one passenger by explaining that his daughter had been delivered by a Lebanese doctor.         She also intervened during beatings, often putting herself in harm's way.         ''Don't you hit that person,'' she would shout, a passenger later told The New York Times. ''Why do you have to hit those people?''         When a ground crew in Algiers refused to refuel the plane without payment, even when faced with the terrorists' threat to kill passengers, it occurred to Ms. Derickson to offer her Shell credit card. The ground crew charged about $5,500 for 6,000 gallons of fuel.         The most terrifying moment for her, she later told Glamour Magazine, was when the crueler of the two hijackers asked her to marry him.         At one point they asked Ms. Derickson to sort through the passengers' passports to single out people with Jewish-sounding names. Although various news organizations initially reported that she had followed their orders, she in fact hid the passports, her son said. ''Everybody looked to her for courage and guidance,'' Tom Cullins, an architect in Burlington, Vt., who was a hostage on the plane, said in an interview yesterday. ''She was clearly in control. She even made demands of the hijackers.''         Mr. Cullins added, ''We have nothing but the utmost respect for her and a debt of gratitude for really heroic acts.''         After about 36 hours, the terrorists released a second wave of hostages, including Ms. Derickson and 65 others, in Algiers. They had already killed a Navy diver, Robert D. Stethem, but his was to be the only death. The hijackers released other hostages over the next 15 days, with the ordeal ending for the last 39 on June 30. It ended after Israel's release of 31 Lebanese prisoners, a fraction of the 766 the hijackers had demanded.         Ms. Derickson became the first woman to receive the Silver Cross for Valor, awarded by the Legion of Valor, a veterans organization. ''The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story,'' a 1988 movie that appeared on NBC and featured Lindsay Wagner as Ms. Derickson, received five Emmy nominations.         Ulrike Patzelt was born on Aug. 8, 1944, in Aussig an der Elbe, Czechoslovakia, near the German border, and was raised in Bavaria. She worked as an au pair in Britain and Switzerland before immigrating to Connecticut in 1967.         She began working for T.W.A. a few years later and joined Delta in the early 1990's.         Her husband, Russell G. Derickson, a former pilot, died in 2003. She is survived by her son, of San Diego, and her mother, Marianne Patzelt of Nuremberg, Germany.       
         Sara Stein, an influential advocate for gardening with native plants, died Feb. 25 at her home in Vinalhaven, Me. She was 69.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Martin Stein.         In ''Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Backyards'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Ms. Stein lamented the effects of traditional suburban landscaping on her six-acre homestead in Pound Ridge, N.Y., three acres of which were scraped in the 1930's to provide topsoil for the 1939 New York World's Fair.         She wrote how she and her husband had undertaken the process of ''ungardening,'' or changing what had become an environment of sterile lawn and plantings into carefully researched ecosystems representing swamp, prairie, rock barren and other native environments. The result attracted birds, small mammals and other wildlife.         ''Noah's Garden,'' which mingled good-humored anecdotes about her family with widely applicable advice, caught the attention of gardeners and homeowners around the country and became a bible for a growing native landscape movement. Ms. Stein was soon in demand as a speaker to gardening and environmental groups.         She followed the book with ''Planting Noah's Garden: Further Adventures in Backyard Ecology'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1997) and ''Noah's Children: Restoring the Ecology of Childhood'' (North Point Press, 2001), a meditation on the role the natural environment plays in childhood development.         Ms. Stein was born Sara Bonnett in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1935, the second of three daughters of Earl Clough Bonnett, an insurance medical examiner, and Sara Bonnett, a psychoanalyst. She attended Cornell College for a year and earned her bachelor's degree in Russian studies at the New School for Social Research. In 1959, she married Mr. Stein, an architect.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Stein is survived by four sons, Lincoln, of Glen Cove, N.Y.; Rafael, of Ramsey, N.J.; Joshua, of Acton, Mass.; and Aram, of Richmond, Calif.; two sisters, Suzanne Caffuzzi, of Manhattan, and Diantha Guessous, of Rabat, Morocco; and six grandchildren.         Ms. Stein began her career as a toy designer, which led to her writing children's books. She started off in 1974 with a series on sensitive subjects like hospitals, dying and handicaps. The books were subtitled ''An Open Family Book for Parents and Children Together'' (Walker & Company). In 1979 she added ''On Divorce'' and ''The Adopted One'' to the series, and in 1983 ''About Phobias'' and ''Making Babies.'' The same year she published ''Girls and Boys: The Limits of Nonsexist Childrearing'' (Scribner's).         Among her other books is a series on how to raise various pets that led to ''Great Pets: An Extraordinary Guide to Usual and Unusual Family Pets'' (Workman, 1976).         Another series explained science to children and included ''The Science Book'' (Workman, 1980), ''The Evolution Book'' (Workman, 1986) and ''The Body Book'' (Workman, 1992). Ms. Stein's focus turned to gardening with ''My Weeds: A Gardener's Botany'' (1988).         Ms. Stein, who sometimes illustrated her own books, created a handmade dollhouse that was exhibited at the Museum of the City of New York for more than a year and became the basis of ''A Family Dollhouse'' (Viking, 1979).       
         Hildegarde, whose career as an international cabaret chanteuse spanned almost seven decades and who was credited with starting the single-name vogue among entertainers, died on Friday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. She was 99.         Her death was confirmed yesterday by her longtime friend and manager, Don Dellair.         A regal figure in couturier gowns, jeweled glasses, glittering earrings and, in her later years, a curly platinum wig, Hildegarde influenced a number of other performers. She accompanied herself on the piano, always in her trademark long white gloves, and, fluttering a lace handkerchief, chatted between numbers, often poking fun at herself.         ''Hildegarde was perhaps the most famous supper-club entertainer who ever lived,'' Liberace once said. ''I used to absorb all the things she was doing, all the showmanship she created. It was marvelous to watch her, wearing elegant gowns, surrounded with roses and playing with white gloves on. They used to literally roll out the red carpet for her.''         Although Liberace said he was careful not to imitate her, he did take a single stage name and used ''I'll Be Seeing You,'' one of her best-known numbers, as his own theme song.         Usually billed as the Incomparable Hildegarde, an orchid bestowed on her by Walter Winchell, she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1930's and 40's, when she was booked in plush hotel cabaret rooms and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a year. At one engagement in 1946, she was paid $17,500 a week and 50 percent of the gross over $80,000. She was on the cover of Life magazine in 1939, had a top 10 radio show and traveled with her own orchestra and several dozen pieces of luggage.         Her recordings of such songs as ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' ''The Last Time I Saw Paris'' and ''Lili Marlene'' became worldwide hits. Revlon introduced a Hildegarde shade of lipstick and nail polish, a nursery named a rose for her, and a linen company, picking up on the way she signed her autograph, introduced a ''Bless You'' handkerchief.         Hildegarde's admirers ranged from enlisted men and officers during World War II to King Gustaf of Sweden and the Duke of Windsor. In 1961 she was the guest of honor at a gala at which Eleanor Roosevelt presented her with an award naming her First Lady of the Supper Clubs.         From the 1950's through the 70's, in addition to her cabaret appearances and record albums, she appeared in a number of television specials and toured with the national company of the Stephen Sondheim musical ''Follies.'' Her autobiography, ''Over 50  So What!'' was published by Doubleday in 1961. In 1980, she was in a revival of the 1927 musical ''The Five O'Clock Girl'' at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., and took part in a tour of ''The Big Broadcast of 1944,'' which recreated radio programs of that year. She also did a number of lecture tours at universities and auditoriums, singing, playing, chatting and answering questions.         Born Hildegarde Loretta Sell in Adell, Wis., to German immigrant parents, she began her career in Milwaukee at the age of 16 when, as a music student at Marquette University, she played the piano in a silent movie house. In 1928 she joined a vaudeville troupe, toured for two seasons and then spent a year as an accompanist to various performers. She arrived in New York by way of Camden, N.J., where she struck up a friendship with Anna Sosenko, her landlady's daughter and a budding songwriter, who became the architect of her career.         ''Anna was determined to be a songwriter,'' Hildegarde recalled. ''She made me go with her to New York to sing her work to publishers.'' For a time, Hildegarde took a job as a song plugger for Irving Berlin. She emerged as the one-name Hildegarde after an audition with Gus Edwards, the impresario, who suggested she lose her surname. Ms. Sosenko became her business manager and the two traveled, lived and collected art together for 23 years.         Ms. Sosenko wrote ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' which became Hildegarde's signature song, and was the singer's partner until 1955, when the relationship dissolved. The friendship resumed two decades later.         Although most of her career was in the United States, Hildegarde was engaged to appear at the Café de Paris in London when she was in her early 20's. She was not a great success, but the experience led her and Ms. Sosenko to take off for Paris to learn the art of cabaret.         They remained there for three years. Ms. Sosenko helped her perfect her technique, and she acquired an international flavor by learning to sing in French, Russian, Italian and Swedish. She also developed the precise diction that made every word clear and reduced her slight German accent.         Her name became synonymous with the best clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1934, she sang at the Ritz Hotel in London during the Duke of Kent's wedding festivities. The next year she was back for King George V's jubilee, and she returned in 1937 for King George VI's coronation. She also appeared in several British movies and stage revues.         During the zenith of her career in the 40's, Hildegarde's name appeared on best-dressed lists, and people were stunned when she said she spent $10,000 a year on clothes. By the 60's, the sum had risen to $30,000.         ''I rarely look back, '' she said as she approached 90. ''That's part of the secret of staying young.''         She leaves no immediate survivors, her manager, Mr. Dellair, said.         During a 1993 performance at Manhattan's Algonquin Hotel, Hildegarde said: ''Wrinkle, wrinkle, leave me alone. Go and sliver Sharon Stone.''         ''I can't imagine myself not performing,'' she said in 1995. ''I like to be in harness. I'm good, I know I'm good, and I'm ready.''         Another cabaret legend, Bobby Short, who died this year at 80, once said, ''Hers was the slickest nightclub act of all time.''

         Barbara Bel Geddes, a critically acclaimed stage, screen and television actress known for her work with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950's and, more recently, for her role as Miss Ellie, the matriarch of the fractious Ewing clan on the long-running nighttime soap opera ''Dallas,'' died on Monday at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 82.         The Jordan-Fernald Funeral Home in Mount Desert, Me., confirmed the death to The Associated Press, giving no cause. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Ms. Bel Geddes had died of lung cancer.         On Broadway Ms. Bel Geddes was best known as the original Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on Hot Tin Roof,'' which opened in 1955. She also appeared in ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1951) and ''Silent Night, Lonely Night'' (1959). Her film credits include Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' (1958); ''Caught'' (1949), directed by Max Ophüls; and ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), directed by Elia Kazan.         On television Ms. Bel Geddes starred in several episodes of Hitchcock's weekly series ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1980 she won the Emmy Award for best actress in a dramatic series for her role on ''Dallas.''         Blond, soft-spoken and slightly plump as a young woman, Ms. Bel Geddes projected a resolute, even steely, intelligence beneath her cherubic exterior. It was a quality Hitchcock used to great effect, notably in ''Vertigo,'' in which Ms. Bel Geddes played Midge, the steadfast, unglamorous ex-fiancée of Jimmy Stewart, who watches his painful descent into obsession and madness.         Hitchcock used her memorably again in ''Lamb to the Slaughter,'' widely considered one of the finest episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' Broadcast in the spring of 1958, it starred Ms. Bel Geddes as a wife who murders her philandering husband by bludgeoning him with a frozen leg of lamb. When detectives show up to investigate the death, the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. Ms. Bel Geddes, smiling a tiny, knowing smile, sits them down to a home-cooked meal.         Barbara Bel Geddes was born in New York on Oct. 31, 1922. Her father was Norman Bel Geddes, the architect and stage designer. She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the forgettable play ''Out of the Frying Pan.'' She went on to win a Theater World Award in 1946 for her performance in ''Deep Are the Roots,'' which Kazan directed.         Soon afterward, Ms. Bel Geddes went to Hollywood, where she starred opposite Henry Fonda in her first film, ''The Long Night'' (1947). Although she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Katrin Hanson, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948), Ms. Bel Geddes made relatively few movies, working primarily in theater and television. Her other film credits include ''Blood on the Moon'' (1948), ''Fourteen Hours'' (1951) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).         Ms. Bel Geddes's greatest critical acclaim came as Maggie, the restless young wife in a decaying family of Mississippi planters in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it ''vital, lovely and frank.''         Her other Broadway credits include ''The Living Room'' (1954), by Graham Greene; ''The Sleeping Prince'' (1956), by Terence Rattigan; and ''Mary, Mary'' (1961), by Jean Kerr.         Ms. Bel Geddes appeared on ''Dallas'' in two installments, the first from 1978 to 1984, when she retired after heart surgery. She was replaced as Miss Ellie by Donna Reed, who sued to retain the role after the show's producers reinstated Ms. Bel Geddes in 1985. Ms. Reed lost her bid, and Ms. Bel Geddes remained in the role until 2000.         Ms. Bel Geddes's first marriage, to Carl Schreuer, an engineer, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Windsor Lewis, a theater director, died before her. She is survived by a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage, and a daughter, Betsy, from her second.         In addition to acting, Ms. Bel Geddes also worked as a professional artist. She wrote and illustrated two children's books, ''I Like to Be Me'' (Viking, 1963) and ''So Do I'' (Arbor House, 1972).         Looking back on her career, Ms. Bel Geddes expressed amusement that she was so often cast as patricians. ''They're always making me play well-bred ladies,'' she told People magazine in 1982. She added, ''I'm not very well bred, and I'm not much of a lady.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Barbara Bel Geddes on Thursday misstated the year of her final appearance on the television show ''Dallas.'' It was 1990, not 2000. A picture caption referred incorrectly to the character she played. It was Miss Ellie, not Ms. Ellie.       
         Jane Lawrence Smith, an actress and singer and the widow of the architect and sculptor Tony Smith, died on Aug. 5 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 90.         Her death was announced by her family.         Ms. Smith was one of the last survivors of the central circle of Abstract Expressionist artists and companions who came to the fore in New York in the 1940's and 50's. Her husband was close to Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, and she was the subject of one of Pollock's late black-and-white paintings, ''No. 7'' (1952), now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Two of her daughters, Kiki Smith and Seton Smith, are artists, adding to her prominence in the art world, but she made a career of her own in entertainment.         Jane Lawrence was born in Bozeman, Mont., in 1915 and raised in Mount Vernon, Wash. At 16, she began studying theater. By the time she was 18, she was living in New York and making her way in the theater. She appeared on Broadway in the original casts of ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Inside U.S.A.'' and ''Where's Charley?,'' the musical based on ''Charley's Aunt.'' As June Lawrence, she appeared in the Columbia Pictures movie ''Sailor's Holiday'' (1944), and she was also in three independent films.         In 1943 she married Tony Smith in Hollywood, with her close friend Tennessee Williams as best man. Her family said she helped inspire aspects of the character Blanche DuBois in Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire.''         In 1950 she traveled to Europe and began an opera career in Germany; the next year she sang the part of Electra in the 1951 Salzburg Festival presentation of ''Idomeneo,'' conducted by Georg Solti. After her husband's death, in 1980, she resumed her acting career, this time in avant-garde theater, and worked with the directors John Jesurun, Joan Jonas and Marianne Weems.         Ms. Smith's daughter Beatrice Smith Robinson died in 1988. In addition to her daughters Kiki and Seton, who live in New York, she is survived by a granddaughter.
