She was 75 years old.         Cay M. Andersen, a faith healer and co-founder of the Community of Jesus, a residential religious community based in Orleans, Mass., died of heart failure in her sleep on Wednesday at her home in Orleans. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Andersen, known in the community as Mother Cay, and Judy H. Sorensen, both lay members of the Episcopal Church, founded the community 30 years ago in an effort to bring about reconciliation among the various Christian denominations and to develop healing as a way of life.         The ecumenical community of 300 adults and children, as well as 500 nonresident members, includes among its residents 12 members of the clergy from five denominations.         The community also has become a focal point for religious music, in particular a movement to preserve the Gregorian chant, an ancient form of worship, in collaboration with Benedictine monks and nuns in France.         Earlier this year Mrs. Andersen and Mrs. Sorensen had an audience with Pope John Paul II in recognition of their spiritual work.         Mrs. Andersen was born in East Weymouth, Mass., and atttended the Vesper George Art School in Boston.         She is survived by her husband, John W. Andersen.

        Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.         Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of the popular and influential 1930's singing trio the Boswell Sisters, died Saturday. She was 77 years old and lived here.         Miss Boswell died in Peekskill Community Hospital, where she had been admitted with pneumonia, her daughter, Chica Minnerly, said.         Helvetia Boswell - she was known by her nickname - and her sisters Martha and Connee were born and brought up in New Orleans.         They gained fame in the late 1920's and early 30's for harmonies and arrangements that filtered jazz and blues into a style that was a precursor of swing and influenced such performers as Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers and the Andrews Sisters.         Among the trio's popular songs were ''Dinah,'' ''Yes Sir, That's My Baby,'' ''The Music Goes Round and Round'' and ''Top Hat.'' They appeared in three feature films and several shorts.         She retired from performing when the trio broke up. Martha died in 1958 and Connee, who had a successful solo career, died in 1976.         Vet Boswell is survived by her daughter, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed her social schedule.         Her husband, Morris Cafritz, a millionare Washington real estate developer and businessman, died in 1964. After his death, she became president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6 million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community service, health and education.         The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from below, to Supreme Court justices. President Harry Truman, however, favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Perle Mesta.         Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in the 1920's. In June 1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ''trip back into Washington social history.''         In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in furs and jewelry.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.
