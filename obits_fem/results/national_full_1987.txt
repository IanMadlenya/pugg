Mrs. Reyher was 89 years old.         Rebecca Hourwich Reyher, a veteran suffragist, author and lecturer, died of pnuemonia last Saturday at the home of her daughter, Faith Jackson, in St. Inigoes, Md. Mrs. Reyher was 89 years old.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Reyher lived in Manhattan on and off for most of her life. As a young suffragist, she held street meetings on women's causes and was head of the Boston and New York offices of the National Woman's Party.         Beginning in 1924, Mrs. Reyher made six trips to Africa, which resulted in numerous articles and two books on life in Africa, ''Zulu Woman'' (1948) and ''The Fon and His Hundred Wives'' (1952). She later lectured on women and Africa at schools and colleges, including New York University and the New School for Social Research. Her collection of African artifacts was presented to Westbrook College in Portland, Me., as the Sinon collection.         Her marriage in 1917 to the late Ferdinand Reyher, a writer, ended in divorce in 1934.         In addition to her daughter, three grandsons and two great-grandchildren survive.       
        Dr. Charlotte Friend, a medical microbiologist who made major contributions to the understanding of cancer during a career that spanned almost four decades, died Tuesday after a long illness. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Charlotte Friend, a medical microbiologist who made major contributions to the understanding of cancer during a career that spanned almost four decades, died Tuesday after a long illness. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         In 1956, Dr. Friend discovered a virus that causes leukemia in mice. The virus, named the Friend virus, has been an important tool for study of the relationships between animal cancers and viruses for many years.         At the time of her death, Dr. Friend was professor and director of the Center for Experimental Cell Biology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Her most important scientific achievements were in immunology and the relationships between cancer and viruses. She also helped shape the educational and research philosophy of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, which was just getting started when she joined its faculty in 1966.         ''Her presence was a major factor in establishing at the fledgling medical school a balance between emphasis on clinical care and on basic scientific research,'' said Dr. Nathan Kase, dean of the medical school. New Concept on Cancer         Her recent contributions included evidence that cancer cells may be capable of progressing - differentiating - from the cancerous state to normalcy if subjected to appropriate chemical stimuli. In theory, that concept might lead to an entirely new type of cancer treatment in which the goal would be that of selectively favoring the growth of normal cells rather than simply killing cancer cells. Conventional anti-cancer drugs act mainly by killing cancer cells, but they kill many normal cells in the process.         The new concept of inducing differentiation to normalcy in cancer tissues is undergoing early tests in patients at several research centers under the sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute and other agencies.         When Dr. Friend began studies of animal cancer viruses, most scientists considered it heretical to suggest that viruses might also be involved in human cancers. Today several viruses are known to be crucial factors in causing human cancers. Many years of research with animal cancer viruses was indispensible to proving the links between other viruses and human cancers.         The Friend virus has been so important in cancer research that it is the focus of an entire chapter in Oncogenic Viruses, a definitive text on cancer virus research by Dr. Ludwik Gross of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in the Bronx.         She was born in New York, March 11, 1921, received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944 and a doctorate in bacteriology from Yale University in 1950. She worked at Sloan-Kettering Institute and Cornell Medical College until 1966 when she moved to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.         She is survived by a sister, Pricilla Simon of the Bronx, and a brother, Morris of Massapequa, L.I.         CHARLOTTE FRIEND DIES AT 65       
        Elizabeth Gilmore Holt, an art historian who wrote widely on the social context of art, died Monday at her home in Washington. She was 81 years old.         Elizabeth Gilmore Holt, an art historian who wrote widely on the social context of art, died Monday at her home in Washington. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Holt, who viewed the history of art as an expression of the intellectual spirit of periods in history, traveled worldwide to gather material for her books.         On a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1980 she flew around the world to complete research on the art of all nations. When she was in her 60's, she hitchhiked on oil-tanker trucks from Iran to India to follow the route Alexander the Great took on his way to invade India.         Mrs. Holt wrote ''Literary Sources of Art History'' and the two-volume ''Documentary History of Art.'' Wrote Series on European Art         She also wrote a series of books on ''The Emerging Role of Exhibitions and Critics'' in 19th-century Europe. The first volume, ''The Triumph of Art for the Public,'' covered the years 1785 to 1848. She edited the second volume, ''The Art of All Nations: 1850-1873.'' The remaining two volumes, titled ''The Expanding World of Art,'' are being prepared for publication by the Yale University Press.         Mrs. Holt was born in San Francisco. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, she earned a master's degree at Radcliffe College and a doctorate in art history at the University of Munich. She received honorary degrees from Syracuse University and St. Andrew's University in Scotland.         Mrs. Holt was long associated with women's causes. In 1951, the City of Berlin presented her with its Freedom Bell in recognition of her work with members of women's trade unions in postwar Germany.         She is survived by her husband, John B. Holt, of Georgetown, Me.; a daughter, Elizabeth H. Muench, of Lexington, Mass.; two sons, John A., of Chicago, and Peter G., of Potomac, Md.; a brother, John A. Gilmore of Osterville, Mass., and six grandchildren.         A memorial service is scheduled at 2 P.M. Saturday in the Bethlehem Chapel of the National Cathedral in Washington.       
        Cora Downs, 94 years old, an internationally known microbiologist, died Tuesday.         Cora Downs, 94 years old, an internationally known microbiologist, died Tuesday.         Dr. Downs gained national recognition in 1924 for her work on tularemia, a viral disease commonly known as rabbit fever. Her subsequent research provided important insights into the understanding of Rock Mountain spotted fever, rickettsia and Q fever.       
        Peggy Bacon, a poet, author, artist and illustrator of more than 60 books, whose whimsical pastels featured some of Manhattan's toughest alley cats, died Sunday in Kennebunk, Me. She was 91 years old. Her many-faceted career spanned several decades. She was most recently in the news in 1975, when the National Collection of Fine Arts in         Peggy Bacon, a poet, author, artist and illustrator of more than 60 books, whose whimsical pastels featured some of Manhattan's toughest alley cats, died Sunday in Kennebunk, Me. She was 91 years old. Her many-faceted career spanned several decades. She was most recently in the news in 1975, when the National Collection of Fine Arts in Washington honored her with a yearlong retrospective.         The heyday of her fame came in the 1920's and 30's, when as both graphic artist and writer, she was much admired for the wit, the charm and the plain-spoken honesty of her work, much of which consisted of satirical, though affectionate, glimpses of her day. 'Reservoir of Warm Feeling'         In reviewing the 1975 retrospective, Hilton Kramer, then the art critic of The New York Times, wrote that Miss Bacon ''brings a large reservoir of warm feeling to the most ordinary subjects - the playfulness of a cat, the peculiar gait of a man or woman in the street, an outdoor picnic or a summer camp - and if she does not always avoid a certain sentimentality, she nonetheless impresses us with her sincerity.''         In 1980, Miss Bacon received the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters' Gold Medal for graphic art in recognition of ''her long and impressive career as graphic artist and illustrator.''         Margaret Frances Bacon was born in Ridgefield, Conn, on May 2, 1895. She graduated from the Kent Place School, in Summit, N.J., in 1913, and studied at the Art Students League of New York, where she was an instructor in painting, drawing and composition from 1935 to 1936 and 1948 to 1952, She also studied at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts.         She was the author and illustrator of such works as ''Lion-Hearted Kitten,'' ''Mercy and the Mouse,'' ''The Terrible Nuisance,'' ''Animosities,'' ''Off With Their Heads,'' ''Cat-Calls,'' ''Starting From Scratch'' and ''The Good American Witch.''         She is survived by a daughter, Belinda Bacon of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Alexander Bacon Brook, of Sag Harbor, L.I.; four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

Martin, founder of the National Federation of Republican Women's Clubs, died Thursday at her home here. She was 86 years old.         Miss Martin also was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee.         She was educated at Wellesley College, Mass., and the University of Maine. Her political career began in 1930 with her election to the Maine House. She was re-elected to a second term, then won two terms in the State Senate.         She was the only woman and nonlawyer on the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee. On that panel, she once said, she ''could get just so far in an argument, then I'd hit a stone wall of legal phraseology - so I studied law in self-defense.'' Between legislative sessions, she took law courses at Yale and Northwestern universities.         From 1936 to 1946, she was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee in Washington and head of its women's division. In that capacity, she founded what is now the National Federation of Republican Women.         From 1947 to 1972, in Maine, she was Commissioner of Labor and Industry for the State of Maine.       
        Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Ireene Wicker Hammer, who as ''The Singing Lady'' told fairy tales over radio and television to millions of American children, died yesterday in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She had been on the air with few interruptions from 1931 to 1975, and the programs led to books and records for children. Her 30 awards included a Peabody and an Emmy. On her radio show, heard in the early evening for decades, she told stories in which she acted each part - ranging from princesses and wicked stepmothers to dragons - with a piano accompaniment. For this she was known as the ''Lady With a Thousand Voices.''         In the late 1930's and early 40's, national polls of radio editors consistently placed her programs first in juvenile entertainment. More than 25 million children listened to her regularly.         She was born Irene Seaton in Quincy, Ill., in 1900 and educated at public schools there. She graduated from the University of Illinois, where she studied music and drama. She then studied at the Goodman School of the Theater in Chicago and appeared in professional roles at the Goodman Theater in 1929 and 1930. Letter Added for Luck         Early in her radio career, she changed the spelling of her first name to Ireene with three ''e's'' when she was told by a numerologist that one more letter would bring her great success.         With her first husband, Walter Charles Wicker, a radio writer, producer and actor, she performed in two early soap operas, ''Today's Children'' and ''Harold Teen.''         The Wickers had a son, Walter Charles Jr., who died in action as a fighter pilot in World War II, and a daughter, Nancy.         Her debut as a children's radio entertainer came as a direct result of the way she amused her own offspring, telling tales and singing songs. ''The Singing Lady'' began as a local radio program in Chicago. Her Routine Was Her Own         According to an account by Val Adams in The New York Times, the sponsoring Kellogg's cornflakes company handed her a list of nursery rhymes and told her to do a children's program. ''She developed the routine of dramatizing fairy tales and playing all the parts herself,'' Mr. Adams wrote in 1948.         When television came along, she adapted her ''Singing Lady'' format to the new medium, using marionettes to act out her stories while she supplied the voices.         During the 1950's, Red Channels, a private blacklisting publication, charged that the actress had sponsored a re-election committee for a Communist councilman in New York. She denied she had even heard of the man and the charges were later withdrawn with apologies.         After her program was discontinued on commercial radio, it was later resumed on the Public Broadcasting System, and she was also heard on network radio affiliates.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1938. In 1941 she married Victor J. Hammer, co-owner with his brother Armand of the Hammer Galleries in New York. He died in 1985.         Mrs. Hammer is survived by her daughter, Nancy Eilan of Stamford, Conn.

She has no immediate survivors.       
        Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev.         Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Norway when he was presented the Nobel Peace Prize.         ''The state has lost not only a leading civil rights activist but a legendary educator and humanitarian,'' Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said today.         Mrs. Clark attended Avery Institute in Charleston, and received a bachelor's degree from Benedict College in Columbia and a master's degree from Hampton Institute in Virginia. Worked in Teacher Campaign         She began her teaching career at a black public school on John's Island and, in 1918, accepted a teaching post at Avery. That year, she was instrumental in getting about 20,000 signatures on a petition to have black teachers hired by the Charleston County School District.         Mrs. Clark moved to Columbia in 1927 to teach and helped in a campaign to equalize teacher salaries.         She later was dismissed from a teaching job in Charleston for being a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         In the late 1950's she worked at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where she developed a program to teach blacks to read and write well enough to pass voter literacy tests. She lectured around the country and later became a director of the school and a supervisor of teacher training for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.         Her autobiography, ''Echo In My Soul,'' was published in 1962.         In 1974, Mrs. Clark was elected to the Charleston County School Board.         Mrs. Clark received a Living Legacy Award from President Carter in 1979 and the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian award, in 1982.         She is survived by a son, Nerie D. Clark Jr., of Hickory, N.C., a sister and two brothers.       
        Molly O'Day, who never became a major national star but who was prized by aficionados as one of the finest country-and-western singers ever, died of cancer of the colon Saturday at Cabell Huntington Hospital in Huntington, W.Va. She was 64 years old.         Molly O'Day, who never became a major national star but who was prized by aficionados as one of the finest country-and-western singers ever, died of cancer of the colon Saturday at Cabell Huntington Hospital in Huntington, W.Va. She was 64 years old.         Miss O'Day retired in 1952, when she was only 29. Yet she was called ''one of the greatest, if not the greatest, women singers in country music'' by Robert Shelton, former popular-music critic of The New York Times. Dolly Parton said Miss O'Day's singing had profoundly influenced her. And Earl Scruggs, the bluegrass banjo player, said he had once been beaten by her in a Kentucky banjo-picking contest, and that he had been awed by both her singing and her banjo playing.         Miss O'Day, whose original name was LaVerne Williamson, was born in McVeigh, Ky., in the same eastern Kentucky hills that also produced such country stars as Loretta Lynn and Ricky Scaggs. A Pure, Roughly Urban Sound         Her career began in 1939, when she joined her fiddle-playing brother, Skeets, in a touring country band. At that time she assumed the first of many stage names, Mountain Fern. Her name became Dixie Lee in 1940, and the next year she married a fellow band member, Lynn Davis. It was only later that she chose the stage name Molly O'Day.         Miss O'Day's recordings, 36 songs made for Columbia Records between 1946 and 1951, document a purer, more roughly rural country style than the urbanized, smoothed-over Nashville sound that has since come to dominate country music. Her most famous number was ''The Tramp on the Street''; others included ''Teardrops Falling in the Snow,'' ''Don't Sell Daddy Any More Whisky'' and Hank Williams's ''Singing Waterfall.''         Her recordings included considerable sacred music, exclusively so after 1950. In 1952 she contracted tuberculosis, which greatly curtailed her singing. Her secular career ended when she and her husband decided to become ministers in the Church of God.         Her later years were spent reclusively in Huntington. She refused honors, and insisted that her career had had no impact on modern country music.         She is survived by her husband.       
        Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Tom Schulz, a nephew of Mrs. Burton, said she died at 8:22 P.M. at the George Washington University Hospital here.         ''Mrs. Burton, recently hospitalized for further treatment and recuperation from cancer surgery, experienced a sudden decline this weekend after an apparent stabilization of her illness,'' Mr. Schulz said.  Mrs. Burton underwent surgery for colon cancer surgery in August. Her last public appearance was on Dec. 9. Swearing-in Was Delayed         Mrs. Burton arrived at her Congressional office for the opening day of Congress on Jan. 6, after insisting that she would appear. However, later in the day she became ill and was forced to leave before the swearing-in ceremonies of the 100th Congress.         The House passed a resolution allowing her to be sworn-in at home, and the oath was administered Jan. 7 by the chairman of the California delegation, Don Edwards, also a Democrat.         ''She took the oath, signed all the papers, and gave me a bottle of champagne,'' Mr. Edwards said. Mrs. Burton entered the George Washington University Hospital the next day. Re-elected in 1984 and 1986         Mrs. Burton, who represented a large portion of San Francisco, was a member of the House Rules Committee. She was elected in 1983 to complete the term of her husband, Phillip, and was re-elected in 1984 and 1986.         Although Phillip Burton was one of Congress' leading liberals, his widow traced her interest in politics to her teen-age years, when she and her parents fled Poland ahead of the Nazi occupation forces.         ''I saw and felt what happened in Western Europe when the Nazis were moving,'' she once said. ''You learn that politics is everybody's business.''         Politics was her business most of the time after she met her husband in 1950 at a convention of the California Young Democrats. 'She Astounded Everybody'         Phillip Burton spent nearly two decades in Congress and championed his liberal causes with a brash style.         ''Phil was so overwhelming he would just take over when he walked into a room,'' Mr. Edwards recalled recently. ''It tended to put her in the role as a shy wife. But she was operating all the time.         ''When Phil died, she astounded everybody,'' he said. ''First, she was on the Education and Labor Committee.'' When she got on Rules, she was among the very strongest members for national Democratic Party policies. She was an advocate for poor people, education, the environment, and arms reduction. She was a pillar of strength. She didn't give an inch.'' When she returned to the House after her operation last year, Mrs. Burton was welcomed back with a speech by Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., then Speaker of the House. Democratic Party Activities         In the 1950's Mrs. Burton helped organize the California Democratic Council and served as its vice president. She was a delegate to three national Democratic Party conventions.         She also worked closely with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to end discrimination in employment and housing.         From 1972 through 1974, she was president of the Democratic Wives of the House and Senate. She was legislative chairman of the Women's National Democratic Club and its liaison to the House.         Friends said she viewed her job of representing three-quarters of San Francisco's 678,000 residents as a family legacy. After winning the seat, she moved into offices at a Federal building in San Francisco that had been renamed for her husband.         REPRESENTATIVE SALA BURTON, 61

Gerald Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which helped to plead her case, said Mrs. Meiman was admitted to the center on Jan. 20. In asking to go abroad, Mrs. Meiman said she wanted to undergo specialized radiation treatment, her only remaining hope for survival. Complications Reported         According to Mr. Strober, she had various tests complicated by low blood pressure, drug-induced diabetes and infection.         ''Basically she was still being evaluated for the start of chemotherapy,'' Mr. Strober said.  She was the wife of Prof. Naum Meiman, a mathematician who himself had long been denied an exit visa on the ground that he did secret work 30 years ago. Professor Meiman, 76 years of age, was a member of a now-disbanded group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki accords of 1975.         Professor Meiman said last month that he did not think officials might relent and let him follow his wife now that her health had become precarious. He said that his wife had undergone chemotherapy and four operations and that her only chance lay in American experimental treatment.         Mrs. Meiman, a teacher of English, was married to Professor Meiman in 1981.         Word that she might be able to leave first came from Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat and possible Democratic Presidential candidate, while he was on a visit to Moscow in December. He said he had made a special plea for her to Mikhael S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.         Later, in a meeting, with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Senator Hart was informed of that the case was being ''reconsidered.'' Another Soviet cancer patient, Rimma Bravve, left Moscow on Dec. 18 in Senator Hart's company to receive treatment in New York. Left With Mixed Feelings         At the time of her own departure, Mrs. Meiman said she was leaving with ''mixed feelings'' since her husband had to stay behind. She said she had been feeling weak for some weeks and was eager to enter the Georgetown center.         Donna Hartman, the wife of Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman, accompanied Mrs. Meiman through routine customs and passport controls.         Mrs. Meiman is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Leo Kitrossky, a scientist in Moscow with three children. Also surviving is a daughter of Professor Meiman by a previous marriage, Olga Plam of Boulder, Colo.         INNA MEIMAN, EMIGRE, DIES AT 53       
        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.         Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.         In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.         She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.         Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.         Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.         Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.

She was 96 years old and lived in Palm Beach and Manhattan.         Anna E.M. Levy, a charter founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, died Tuesday in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 96 years old and lived in Palm Beach and Manhattan.         Mrs. Levy and her late husband, Benjamin, were among those who gave money to help establish the college from its inception in 1952 to its completion in 1955.         Mrs. Levy was president of the New York chapter of the college's National Women's Division, a fund-raising organization, and was vice president of the division's national board.         She and her husband, who was a senior partner of Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm, established the college's Benjamin J. and Anna Levy Institute for Biophysics, and the Current Periodicals Room at the college library.         She is survived by a daughter, Bernice L. Rudnick of Manhattan, who is vice chairman of the Einstein College board of overseers; a son, Maurice, of Manhattan, four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
        Maria Augusta von Trapp, the guiding force behind a family of singers who won world reknown when their story was portrayed in the play and film ''The Sound of Music,'' died of heart failure yesterday in Morrisville, Vt., three days after undergoing surgery. She was 82 years old, and had lived in Stowe,         Maria Augusta von Trapp, the guiding force behind a family of singers who won world reknown when their story was portrayed in the play and film ''The Sound of Music,'' died of heart failure yesterday in Morrisville, Vt., three days after undergoing surgery. She was 82 years old, and had lived in Stowe, Vt., for more than 40 years.         The story of the von Trapp family, which fled Austria to avoid complicity with Nazi rule and toured the United States as the Trapp Family Choir, was transformed into one of the movie industry's greatest financial successes, with the release of ''The Sound of Music'' starring Julie Andrews in 1965.         Baroness von Trapp, who had studied to become a nun before marrying an Austrian war hero, Baron Georg von Trapp, in 1927, said she and the rest of the family received little of the $180 million in revenues from the film. However, she praised it for honestly depicting her life story and for bringing joy and hope to millions of people. In interviews, she repeatedly asserted her faith in God and devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. Praised Film's Influence         ''The great good the film and the play are doing to individual lives is far beyond money,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times shortly after the film's release. ''There seems to be so much despair in the world. But so many people write about how much the film has helped them in restoring their confidence in God.''         Born on a train speeding from her parent's Tyrol village to a hospital in Vienna in 1905, Maria Augusta Kutschera was an orphan by her seventh birthday. She was raised by a court-appointed guardian, whom she described as a passionate socialist and extremely anti-Catholic.         After she graduated from the State Teachers College for Progressive Education in Vienna at age 18, she became a candidate for the novitiate at a Benedictine convent in Salzberg. Choice of Church or Family         The abbess of the convent sent her to become a governess at the villa outside Salzberg of Baron Georg von Trapp, a highly decorated submarine commander during World War I, who had retired with his seven children after his first wife's death. The young woman quickly won the affection of the children and, when the Baron proposed marriage, she was torn between her devotion to the church and the family.         She married the Baron in November 1927. The couple later had three children.         The family often sang together, particularly during religious observances. In 1935, a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Franz Waner, came to live with the family and began to tutor the children in Renaissance and Baroque music.         In August 1936, the family's informal singing became a professional enterprise when they won a choral competition at the Salzberg Festival. The Trapp Family Choir conducted a full tour of Europe the next year.         When Austria fell under Nazi rule in March 1938, the family realized that its performances could only continue if it cooperated with the Government. They fled with only a few possessions to Italy, then sailed on to New York, arriving penniliess. Concert at Town Hall         Their first major concert, which brought the Trapp Family Choir national attention, took place in New York in Town Hall on Dec. 10, 1938. In a review of their opening performance, The New York Times commented:         ''There was something unusually lovable and appealing about the modest, serious singers of this little family aggregation as they formed a close semicircle about their self-effacing director for their initial offering, the handsome Mme. von Trapp in simple black, and the youthful sisters garbed in black and white Austrain folk costumes enlivened with red ribbons. It was only natural to expect work of exceeding refinement from them, and one was not disappointed in this.''         The von Trapps toured Europe and the United States the next year, gaining an international reputation for the seven daughters and three sons who sang madrigals and old carols, played ancient instruments and re-enacted family customs on stage. For 15 years, their Christmas concerts at Town Hall were a tradition of the New York Yuletide season.         The family bought a 660-acre farm in Stowe in 1942, which later became a lodge and summer music camp.         The Baron died in 1947 at the age of 57. She Lectured Extensively         The family continued to perform around the world until 1955, and the Baroness lectured and wrote extensively on the family's hardships, faith in God and unity. Her book, ''The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,'' was published in 1949. After her husband's death, she also became heavily involved in Catholic missionary work.         The play, ''The Sound of Music,'' with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, opened on Broadway in the fall of 1959, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. It was a tremendous success, running for more than three years. The film version set box office records around the world, but the Baroness von Trapp said she received only about $500,000 in royalties.         The Baroness received the Honorary Cross First Class from the Austrian Government for improving cultural ties between her native country and the United States, and numerous awards from the Roman Catholic church.         She is survived by a son, Johannes, of Stowe; two daughters, Eleonore Campbell of Waitsfield, Vt., and Rosmarie Trapp of Pittsburgh; two stepsons, Rupert, of Stowe, and Werner, of Waitsfield; three stepdaughters, Agathe von Trapp of Glyndon, Md., Maria F. Trapp of Papua, New Guinea, and Johanna von Trapp of San Diego, and by 29 grandchildren.

        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.

In 1922, a year after she arrived in this country from Georgetown, British Guiana, now Guyana, Mrs. Chance founded the Edwards, Owens Employment Agency, which specialized in finding jobs for people from the Caribbean. That year she also became a senior partner in her family's real estate firm, Edwards Sisters Realty Associates, now the oldest black-owned real estate firm in New York.         From 1948 to 1968, Mrs. Chance was the president of the Harlem Taxpayers and Property Owners Association. She was a director of Freedom National Bank from 1966 to 1971, a member of the New York State Electoral College in 1968 and the president of the Inner City Housing and Development Council from 1972 to 1980.         Mrs. Chance's first husband was the late Dr. Edmund A. Rohlehr. Their son, John A. Rohlehr, a lawyer and commissioner of the State Liquor Authority, died in 1962. Her second husband, Dr. Albion Chance, died in 1955. She is survived by her sister, Sarah Edwards Gray, of Harlem; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

She was a member of the National Advisory Board of the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education, and a board member of the State Regents External Degree Faculty.         She is survived by her husband, Wilbur; a daughter, Allyson, of Manhattan; a son, Louis, of Freeport, L.I.; two sisters, Alice Bowman of White Plains and Pearl Johnson of Millbrook, N.Y., and a brother, Ernie, of Katonah, N.Y.       
        Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         In a 25-year career with The Times, Miss Curtis, as a reporter and as an editor, helped transform the coverage of fashion and society news, supervised the daily page of opinion opposite the editorial page and for the last four years wrote a weekly column of social commentary.         Her column, a blend of reporting and observation that appeared each Tuesday, was discontinued last June, when Miss Curtis became ill and went to Columbus for medical treatment. Her husband, Dr. William E. Hunt, is professor and director of the division of neurologic surgery at the College of Medicine at Ohio State University.         ''Charlotte Curtis, who graced this newspaper for over 25 years, was a warm and considerate friend who could write with a rapier and who, as an editor, was eternally curious and questioning,'' Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, said yesterday. ''As a person and as a superb journalist, she will be missed and mourned.'' Expanded Coverage         As editor of women's and family/ style news from 1965 to 1974, Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received.         Under her direction, reporting on the renascent feminist movement and on controversial issues such as abortion replaced the features on good grooming and shopping that had traditionally appeared on women's news pages.         As an associate editor of The Times in charge of the Op-Ed page from 1974 to 1982, she brought an eclectic approach to a broad range of commentary and analysis on major social, economic and political issues of the day. In that post, she was the first woman to have her name listed on the masthead of The New York Times among its senior editors.         But it was as a society news reporter in the 1960's, chronicling the life styles of the rich and powerful, that Miss Curtis became one of the nation's best-known journalists and set a pattern followed by other writers. Other publications heralded her iconoclastic style, the precision of her technique and the research behind it. ''The Times' girl on the beat studies her subjects with the detachment of a professional sociologist,'' Time magazine reported in February 1965. An Incisive Wit         A strong-willed, indefatigable Vassar graduate with an incisive wit, Miss Curtis documented the mores and foibles of America's constantly evolving upper crust. She scrutinized both aristocrats and parvenus in sybaritic settings: Manhattan penthouses, mansions in Newport and Palm Beach, yachts in the Caribbean, tents in Persepolis and the clubhouses at Churchill and Epsom Downs.         In Palm Beach, she reported on a dowager who installed a marble terrace so her dogs, suffering from the heat, could cool their bellies.         ''Bostonians are an elegantly athletic lot,'' she wrote in a 1965 story about a society ball. ''They prove it periodically by swirling, twirling and swooping about in graceful dance patterns until beads of perspiration materialize on their aristocratic brows.'' The Telling Moment         At a cocktail party held by Leonard Bernstein for the Black Panthers in 1970, when a Panther field marshal stridently outlined his tenets before a small group that included Mr. Bernstein, principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Miss Curtis caught the telling moment:         '' 'If business won't give us full employment, then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people.'         '' 'I dig absolutely,' Mr. Bernstein said.''         Tom Wolfe, who wrote about the same party in his book ''Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,'' said of the ensuing flap: ''It wasn't anything she wrote that infuriated them. It was that she put down exactly what they said. That's always what seems cruelest of all, to hold up a mirror to people that way.''         In addition to her society and family/ style reporting, Miss Curtis over the years pursued a variety of stories with datelines from around the world. Deep Interest in Politics         Her deepest interest, dating from her college days, was in American politics and culture. She covered a number of national political conventions, including the violence-wracked Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, as well as Presidential campaigns and inaugurations.         In June 1968 she was in the press corps aboard the funeral train that carried the body of Senator Robert F. Kennedy from New York to Washington. Describing his eldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, she wrote about the heir to a political dynasty:         ''Down the swaying train he went, putting out his hand in 19 of the other 20 cars saying, 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' while outside in the early afternoon sun, the old men of Linden, N.J., stood silently in their undershirts and the women held handkerchiefs to their faces.         '' 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' he said to strangers, his pin-stripe black suit not yet a shambles from the failing air-conditioning, his PT boat tie clip neatly in place. 'Thanks for coming, thanks for coming.' ''         She was the author of ''First Lady,'' a 1963 book about Jacqueline Kennedy's first year in the White House, and ''The Rich and Other Atrocities,'' a 1976 collection of many of her articles. She also contributed writings to several other books, wrote articles for magazines and was a radio commentator in New York and Ohio. Many Honors for Reporting         Miss Curtis was the recipient of many honors for her reporting, including awards from the New York Newspaper Women's Club, the Ohio Newspaper Women's Club, the New York and Los Angeles branches of Women in Communications, the American Newspaper Women's Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the University of Southern California. She also received five honorary degrees.         A porcelain figurine of a woman with pale blue eyes and impeccably coiffed auburn hair, Miss Curtis stood 5 feet 1 inch tall in her high-heeled Chanel pumps. Her image of Junior League elegance - ladylike suits, discreet quantities of real jewelry and a faint aura of expensive French perfume -was one not usually visible in newsrooms.         Charlotte Murray Curtis was born in Chicago on Dec. 19, 1928, the daughter of George Morris and Lucile Atcherson Curtis. Her father was a surgeon who later took the family to Columbus, and her mother was a diplomat who had been the first woman to be a field officer in the Foreign Service, holding posts with American legations in Switzerland, Panama and Haiti.         Miss Curtis graduated from the Columbus School for Girls, then went to Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., majoring in United States history. After graduating in 1950, she joined The Columbus Citizen, where she was a reporter and society editor for 11 years. Joined The Times in 1961         In 1961, she was hired by The New York Times as a fashion reporter. Two years later, she was assigned to the society beat, with a mandate from Clifton Daniel, then an assistant managing editor, to ''write about society as news and to treat it as sociology.''         In 1965, she was named editor of women's news, a title that was changed to family/style editor in 1971. In 1974, she became editor of the Op-Ed page, leavening serious pieces by academic, government and business leaders with unexpected essays on lighter subjects, such as an exchange of letters between Henry Miller and Erica Jong entitled ''In Praise of Rabelais and Each Other,'' and with bits of Americana, from lesser-known writers.         Besides her husband, Miss Curtis is survived by a sister, Mary Curtis Davey of Los Altos, Calif., three stepchildren and three nieces and nephews.         A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date to be set.         The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the William E. Hunt Fund, Ohio State University Development Fund No. 523340, in care of the Division of Neurologic Surgery, Ohio State University Hospital, 410 West 10th Avenue, N-935 D.H., Columbus, Ohio, 43210.

Hannelore Baron, an artist known for her collages and box assemblages, died of cancer Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Riverdale.         Ms. Baron escaped Nazi Germany with her parents, and her work is marked by the gravity, discretion and understated wit of a survivor. She had a special feeling for paper, for the weight of communication it can bear and the weight of history that settles so easily on its edges and surfaces.         She described herself a pacifist and wanted her quietly intense work to convince others of the need to listen. She used letters as symbols of memory and birds as symbols of vulnerability and the need for song.         She had numerous solo shows in New York and last summer was a participant in ''Jewish Themes - Contemporary Artists II'' at the Jewish Museum.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Museum of American Art and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y.         She is survived by her husband, Herman; a son, Mark; a daughter, Julie; a brother, Hans, and two grandchildren.       
        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.

Faith Whitney Ziesing, a former trustee of Sarah Lawrence College, died of cancer last Friday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Ziesing was president of the New York Junior League from 1938 to 1940. She was a Sarah Lawrence trustee from 1942 to 1957. In 1944, Mrs. Ziesing was the first alumna appointed to the faculty, teaching about the social aspects of economics.         She was an officer on the boards of the Association of the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute and Princeton Hospital. In 1928, Mrs. Ziesing helped start the Women's National Republican Club.         She was born in Durham, N.H., the daughter of Caspar Whitney, a sportswriter, explorer and architect, and Florence Canfield, a founder of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ziesing graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1932. In 1934, she married Morgan Wing and was divorced in 1947. In 1949, she married Hibben Ziesing, a chemical consultant.         In addition to her husband, surviving are three daughters, Whitney Wing Oppersdorf of Lincolnville, Me.; Faith Wing Beiler of Greenwich, Conn., and Lucinda, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
        Vera Caspary, a novelist, playwright and screenwriter best known for her films ''Laura,'' ''Letter to Three Wives'' and ''Les Girls,'' died of a stroke Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.         Vera Caspary, a novelist, playwright and screenwriter best known for her films ''Laura,'' ''Letter to Three Wives'' and ''Les Girls,'' died of a stroke Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.         In her 18 published novels, 10 screen plays and 4 stage plays, Miss Caspary's main theme, whether in a murder mystery, drama or musical comedy, was the working woman and her right to lead her own life, to be independent.         In her autobiography, ''The Secrets of Grown-Ups,'' published in 1979 by McGraw Hill, Miss Caspary wrote, ''This has been the century of the woman, and I know myself to have been a part of the revolution.''         ''In another generation, perhaps the next, equality will be taken for granted,'' she said. ''Those who come after us may find it easier to assert independence, but will miss the grand adventure of having been born in this century of change.''         Miss Caspary, the youngest of three children, was born and raised in Chicago, where her father was a buyer in a department store. After she left school at 18, she wrote advertising copy for a mail-order concern.         ''I gave that up when I realized that one wrote the same thing over and over again whether it was for cold cream or plumbing fixtures,'' she once said.         ''I've always enjoyed making up stories,'' she said. ''I like to get my hands onto all sorts of ideas.'' 'The White Girl'         Her first novel, ''The White Girl,'' published in 1929, was about a black woman who leaves the South for Chicago and poses as a white. Her second and perhaps her favorite novel, ''Thicker Than Water,'' was a study of Portuguese-Jewish family life in Chicago.         Her most famous work was ''Laura,'' her first mystery story, published in 1943 by Houghton Mifflin, followed by ''Bedelia'' and ''Murder at the Stork Club.''         She rewrote ''Laura'' for the now-classic 1944 movie, which starred Gene Tierney as an enigmatic and ambitious career girl and Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker, her malicious mentor.         In 1946, with the help of George Sklar, ''Laura'' was adapted to the stage.         Another mystery story, ''The Weeping and the Laughter,'' published in 1950 by Little Brown, became a national best seller.         In 1958, ''Les Girls'' was chosen as best-written American musical by the screen writers branch of the Writers Guild of America.         Miss Caspary was married to I. G. Goldsmith, who produced such films as ''The Stars Look Down.'' He died in 1964.

        Emma Jean Hawes, one of the world's leading women in tournament bridge, died of breast cancer Tuesday at her home in Fort Worth after a long battle with the disease. She was 75 years old.         Emma Jean Hawes, one of the world's leading women in tournament bridge, died of breast cancer Tuesday at her home in Fort Worth after a long battle with the disease. She was 75 years old.         In 1980, Mrs. Hawes became the fourth American woman to attain the rank of grand master, the highest rank of the World Bridge Federation. Since then, four other American women have reached that rank.         In a playing career lasting more than 30 years, she won four world titles and 11 national titles. She represented the United States on four other occasions.         In Venice in 1974, Mrs. Hawes was a member of the winning American team at the first world championship for women's teams based on continental zones, winning the Venice Trophy. She helped defend the trophy successfully in 1976 in Monte Carlo and in 1978 in New Orleans.         In 1980, in Valkenburg, the Netherlands, she and her regular teammates - Dorothy Hayden Truscott, Jacqui Mitchell, Gail Greenberg, Mary Jane Farell and Marilyn Johnson - became the first Americans to win the Olympiad team title in either the open or women's divisions.         Mrs. Hawes retired from competition in 1981.         She was born in Benton, Ky., and graduated from Cornell University at the age of 18.         She is survived by her husband, David Hawes, a daughter, Evalie Horner, and a granddaughter.       
        Paula Bauersmith, an actress whose career in the theater, radio and television spanned more than three decades, died of cancer on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Paula Bauersmith, an actress whose career in the theater, radio and television spanned more than three decades, died of cancer on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Bauersmith made her New York stage debut in 1931 in Ronald Jeans's ''Lean Harvest,'' after graduating from the Carnegie Institute of Technology. She was a member of the Actors Repertory and, later, the National Repertory Theater, appearing in ''Let Freedom Ring'' and, in 1936, in Irwin Shaw's antiwar drama ''Bury the Dead.'' Miss Bauersmith acted in Off Broadway productions and in stock, as well as in such theater-oriented television programs as ''Studio One,'' ''The U.S. Steel Hour'' and ''Kraft Television Theater.'' A crossword puzzle enthusiast, she was a regular contributor to The New York Times's puzzle page.         Miss Bauersmith is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Warren, an actress living in Los Angeles; a son, Paul Warren, dean of the School of Education at Boston University, and three grandchildren. Miss Bauersmith's husband, Barnett M. Warren, died in 1953.

Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         ''A middle-aged energetic woman who thinks she knows where she's going'' is the way Mrs. Rose described herself 10 years ago, shortly before Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed her a Deputy Mayor. She was the first woman to hold such a job.         Mrs. Rose, whose style reflected her youth in Virginia and Brooklyn, moved through a variety of managerial jobs related to labor.         ''I've gone step by step,'' Mrs. Rose said in 1977. ''They haven't let me skip a step.''         The first step was a job as a fiscal clerk in the Department of Social Services, which in 1949 paid $1,860 a year.         After earning a degree in economics from Brooklyn College in 1963, she was named director of the Bedford-Stuyvesant field office of the city's Department of Labor. Her responsibilities were gradually expanded, and in 1970 Mayor John V. Lindsay named her first deputy commissioner of the city Manpower and Career Development Agency.         In 1972, she became Commissioner of the Department of Employment. While she was in charge of that agency, its budget grew from $55 million to $300 million.         Mrs. Rose was born in Richmond on Sept. 27, 1920. Her family moved to Brooklyn when she was 7 years old, and her mother and father opened the Mason Dining Room at the corner of Fulton Street and Albany Avenue.         After her father died, her mother operated the 12-table restaurant by herself. Mrs. Rose's mother also made dresses in the evening to support the family. ''My mother didn't believe in welfare,'' Mrs. Rose recalled in 1972.         Mrs. Rose often left school to help serve the lunchtime crowd at the restaurant. She attended Public School 3 and was graduated from Girls High School in 1937.         During World War II, she worked as a welder in the construction of the battleship Missouri.         Mrs. Rose was the first woman president of the Catholic Interracial Council. She also held posts in other civic and political organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the National Democratic Committee; the Salvation Army Advisory Committee, and St. Mary's Hospital. She was recently elected president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn chapter of the Lioness Club.         She is survived by a son, Cornelius.

She was 87 years old.         A woman of commanding presence, Mrs. Hammerstein was considered a great beauty throughout her life. Of medium height, with bright blue eyes and, in her later years, snowy white hair, she was known for her flawless carriage and ready wit.         In the early 1930's, Mrs. Hammerstein founded an interior design business, Dorothy Hammerstein Inc., and quickly established herself as one of the most sought-after decorators on both coasts. She retired in the mid-1950's.         In 1949, with her husband and the novelist Pearl Buck, she was a founder of Welcome House (now Welcome House Adoption Sevices) in Doylestown, Pa., an organization that arranges for the adoption of children of American and Asian parents.         She was also actively involved with the Dance Theater of Harlem Inc., both as a board member and as a member of its national advisory board, from its inception in 1969 until her death.

        Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Miss Monroe, the official soloist for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spent much of her career singing the national anthem. She once estimated that she had sung it more than 5,000 times. In 1940 she starred in ''The American Jubilee'' at the New York World's Fair, closing each of 650 performances with the anthem. She sang for Presidents Roosevelt, Johnson and Kennedy, at President Truman's inauguration and at hundreds of other civic and patriotic gatherings.         In 1942, she conducted a community sing, sponsored by the Treasury Department, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. More than 40,000 people attended. During the next four years the Treasury and RCA Victor co-sponsored similar events nationwide to sell war bonds. Anthem Sometimes Barred         On some occasions, however, Miss Monroe refused to sing the song with which she had become so closely identified. When she performed for American troops, she did not sing the national anthem because, she said, ''the men are living it.''         Miss Monroe, who was born on Oct. 23, 1906, in New York, was the daughter of Anna Laughlin and Dwight Monroe, a diamond importer. She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School.         During the 1930's she was featured on three commercial radio programs a week and was a co-star for four years with Frank Munn on NBC's ''American Album of Familiar Music.'' She also appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras and with the Chicago, St. Louis and Metropolitan Opera companies.         Miss Monroe married Harold M. Weinberg, a New York lawyer, in 1961, and was widowed in 1977. She leaves no survivors.         A memorial service will be held at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets.       
        Jacqueline du Pre, a brilliant and charismatic English cellist whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, died last night in London, her concert managers said. She was 42 years old.         Jacqueline du Pre, a brilliant and charismatic English cellist whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis, died last night in London, her concert managers said. She was 42 years old.         Miss du Pre, who was stricken with the disease in 1971, had a career that lasted barely a decade. But during her prime she was recognized as one of the world's leading cellists, and served as a role model for many young musicians. During the late 1960's and early 1970's, Miss du Pre and her husband, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, seemed a charmed couple. Often compared with Robert and Clara Schumann, they were admired for their energy, musicality and youthful glamour.         Miss du Pre's playing was characterized by an unusual mixture of elegance and ferocity. ''Miss du Pre is a cellist in the modern vein,'' Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times after a 1967 concert. ''There is plenty of strength to her playing, and a good measure of romanticism without the romantic string mannerisms of portamento (sliding from note to note) and a fast wide vibrato. She can produce a mellow sound of unusual size and clearly was born to play the cello.''         Miss du Pre excelled in a wide variety of music, specializing in the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and the concertos of Haydn, Boccherini, Schumann, Dvorak and Saint-Saens. She had a particular affinity for English music, and made memorable recordings of the Delius and Elgar concertos. The Elgar was associated more closely with her than with any other cellist since Beatrice Harrison, who died in 1965.         Raymond Ericson, reviewing a 1965 performance of the Elgar work for The Times, observed that ''Miss du Pre and the concerto seemed made for each other, because her playing was so completely imbued with the romantic spirit. Her tone was sizable and beautifully burnished. Her technique was virtually flawless, whether she was playing the sweeping chords that open the concerto, sustaining a ravishing pianissimo tone, or keeping the fast repeated note figures in the scherzo going at an even pace.'' 'Couldn't Feel the Strings'         The first signs of Miss du Pre's illness appeared when she was 26 years old and at the height of her fame. ''My hands no longer worked,'' she recalled in 1978. ''I simply couldn't feel the strings.'' She withdrew from concertizing for one year, then returned, to mixed reviews. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis followed shortly, and Miss du Pre retired.         By the mid-70's, Miss du Pre was virtually paralyzed. She could no longer dress herself, nor stand unaided, nor travel without a great deal of planning. She put all of her energies into two major activities - teaching, whenever possible, and working for the cause of multiple sclerosis research.         ''I had to learn to reconstruct my life,'' she said in 1978. ''But I have found a great deal to do. I go to concerts and see my friends. And the music is still alive in my head.''         Jacqueline du Pre was born in Oxford, England, on Jan. 26, 1945. Her talent was obvious from an early age, and she began cello lessons when she was 5 years old. Her early teachers included Herbert Walenn and William Pleeth; she later studied with Paul Tortelier, Mstislav Rostropovich and Pablo Casals. At the age of 11 she won her first competition, and she eventually took every possible prize for cellists at the Guildhall School of Music.         Her career began in earnest in 1961, when she played a concert at Wigmore Hall in London, using a 1672 Stradivarius that had been presented to her anonymously. ''She was immediately acclaimed for her instinctive feeling for style and breadth of understanding as well as technical proficiency,'' Noel Goodwin wrote in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. When Mr. Rostropovich first heard her play, he remarked that he had found somebody to carry on his work. Married in June 1967         Miss du Pre met Daniel Barenboim at a party in London in 1966. ''Instead of saying good evening,'' she later recalled, ''we sat down and played Brahms.'' They were married in June 1967. Together, they helped begin the South Bank Summer Musical Festival in London the following year.         Mr. Barenboim was once asked what it was like to accompany his wife. ''Difficult,'' he replied. ''It doesn't dawn on her sometimes that we mortals have difficulties in following her.'' In the next few years, they performed throughout the world, both separately and as a duo.         After her incapacitation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, in tandem with an organization called the Jacqueline du Pre Research Fund, presented several benefit concerts at Carnegie Hall. Among the participants were the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the pianist Eugene Istomin and several others. Reviewing a 1980 concert, John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times: ''The consistently high quality of these particular benefits can be traced to the close professional and social circle in which Miss du Pre and her husband move. They know the best, and the best play at their benefits.''         In 1981, Miss du Pre's story became the subject of a Broadway play, ''Duet for One,'' by Tom Kempinski, which starred Anne Bancroft and Max von Sydow.         Throughout her illness, Miss du Pre remained sanguine about the future. ''Nobody knows if I'll ever regain mobility,'' she said in 1978. ''It could be that next week I'll find myself walking down the road. I believe in realistic optimism but not wishful thinking.''         She is survived by her husband.

From 1972 to 1983, Mrs. Heilbrun edited the Christmas Bird Count issue of the National Audubon Society's American Birds magazine. Interest in Tern Colony         For more than 35 years, she kept a protective interest in the tern colony on Great Gull Island, an uninhabited speck of land in Long Island Sound, which the Federal Government turned over to the Museum of Natural History in 1949.         Working with members of the Linnaean Society, she helped re-establish a habitat for the birds on the island and became chairman of the Gull Island Committee.         She had joined the Linnaean Society in 1950 and served as treasurer and archivist for many years and as president from 1977 to 1979.         Mrs. Heilburn is survived by her husband, Douglas; a half-sister, Cynthia Benson of Northampton, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Claire Toft of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Erica Duran of Pearblossom, Calif., and three step-grandchildren.
