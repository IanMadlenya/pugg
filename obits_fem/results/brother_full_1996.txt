         Rhoda Haas Goldman, a San Francisco civic leader and benefactor of a wide variety of causes, died on Saturday while vacationing in Honolulu. She was 71.         She suffered a heart attack, said Duane Silverstein, executive director of the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund in San Francisco.         Over the past five years the fund has contributed some $25 million in grants to cultural and environmental causes. She and her husband, Richard, also established the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1990 to reward grass-roots environmentalists around the world.         Mrs. Goldman, a San Francisco native and graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, was a vice president and past president of the San Francisco Symphony and chairwoman of her city's Memorial to the Six Million Victims of the Holocaust. She was a director of the Mount Zion Health System and former president of the Mount Zion Hospital and Medical Center.         A great-grandniece and heir of Levi Strauss, the denim king, she was a corporate director of his apparel concern, Levi Strauss & Company.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Goldman's survivors include two sons, John D., of Atherton, Calif., and Douglas E., of San Francisco; a daughter, Susan R. Gelman  of Chevy Chase, Md.; a brother, Peter E. Haas Sr., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Esther S. Manz, who was a 208-pound housewife pregnant with her fifth child when a kitchen-table gathering in 1948 inspired her to found TOPS, a weight-loss support group that grew into a 300,000-member nonprofit organization, died on Monday at the Heritage Nursing Home in Milwaukee. Mrs. Manz, who made her home in Greenfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, was 88.         TOPS, which stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly, draws its philosophy from something the 5-foot-2-inch Mrs. Manz, then 40, observed in group sessions intended to prepare women for childbirth: the power of mutual support in helping participants remain within their doctors' guidelines for weight.         TOPS members work out a sensible diet and weight goal with their physician and provide evidence of having consulted a doctor before attending weekly meetings that include a weigh-in and provide support and encouragement for members.         Men and women who achieve their weight goals become KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly), role models who are themselves reinforced in their efforts to maintain their weight by continuing to attend meetings.         "Life is a battle," Mrs. Manz once said. "Just let us win the one on obesity."         According to data from the weekly weigh-ins, TOPS members in 12,000 chapters  in the United States and abroad lost more than 740 tons last year, a spokeswoman said yesterday.         The nonprofit organization, based in Milwaukee, is supported by membership dues -- $16 in each of the first two years and $14 thereafter. When Mrs. Manz wrote TOPS's articles of incorporation in 1952, she committed it to finding a cure for obesity, and TOPS says it has contributed more than $4.5 million to obesity research.         After Mrs. Manz and three friends established their support group at her kitchen table in Milwaukee, the organization's name took its final form as the result of a newspaper article.         Mrs. Manz said she originally thought of it as TOP. "We didn't even have a name for our club at first, but when we went down to The Milwaukee Journal to be interviewed about our organization, the reporter asked what we called ourselves," she said in the group's handbook for new members. When the article was published, the name appeared as TOPS, and Mrs. Manz said it was later suggested that the S be made to stand for "sensibly."         On Jan. 21, 1948, the first meeting of TOPS was held at a Milwaukee community center. In the early days of the organization, Mrs. Manz carried a scale with her as she made her rounds as roving ambassador, organizing meetings.         Mrs. Manz, who achieved average proportions in her effort to control her weight, became president and chairwoman of the TOPS board in 1952. Declining health prompted her to relinquish the presidency in 1991, but she remained chairwoman until her death.         Born in 1907 in Plymouth, Wis., she grew up as Esther Schuland and graduated  in 1926 from Wisconsin State Teachers College. She taught at rural Wisconsin schools, married Gilbert Manz, a steelworker, in 1929 and later moved to Milwaukee, where she became a housewife.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Manz is survived by a son, Gilbert Jr.; four daughters, Bonnie Prieben, Maureen Weigert, Barbara Canapa and Marjory von Hof;  a brother, Carl Schuland, of Green Bay, Wis., 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. All of Mrs. Manz's children live in Milwaukee except for Mrs. von Hof, a resident of Altura, Minn.       
         Sadie Klingenstein Klau, who was an active member on the boards of Montefiore Medical Center and Hunter College, her alma mater, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. She was 97 and lived on the Upper East Side of  Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Felice K. Shea, a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court.         For more than four decades, Mrs. Klau served as a volunteer with the auxiliary at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was executive vice chairwoman and secretary of the Board of Trustees. She also worked in the library, which now bears her name. She was introduced to the Medical Center in 1952 by her late husband, David W. Klau, a businessman who was a trustee.         A native of New York, Mrs. Klau graduated from Hunter College in 1919 with a bachelor of arts degree in French. Over the years, she developed strong ties to  the school, becoming a member of the college's Hall of Fame and receiving honorary medals and degrees. She was also a member of the Board of Governors at  Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.         In addition to Justice Shea, Mrs. Klau is survived by two other daughters, Lucille K. Carothers of Cincinnati and Paula K. Oppenheim of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, James D. Klau of San Juan; a brother, Dr. Percy Klingenstein of New York City; 13 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.

         Alice Ehrenfeld Weil, the first American woman to hold the rank of Assistant  Secretary General at the United Nations, died on Wednesday at her home in New York. She was 70 years old and lived for most of her life on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, a family member said.         As Assistant Secretary General for General Services from 1984 until her retirement in 1986, Mrs. Weil was the highest-ranking American woman to serve at the United Nations. Only a handful of women have held senior positions at the organization.         In her post Mrs. Weil supervised the security and maintenance of United Nations centers throughout the world, as well as procurement for all field operations, the management of United Nations commercial activities, and global purchasing and transportation.         She was born in New York City in 1925. After attending public schools in New  York, she received a bachelor of arts degree in 1945 from Smith College and a doctor of laws degree in 1947 from Yale Law School.         Mrs. Weil worked in the General Counsel's office of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and with what is now the Washington law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson before joining the United Nations in 1952, rising to the post of director of the world body's General Legal Division in 1980.         Mrs. Weil was married in 1958 to Ira Weil. Besides her husband, Mrs. Weil is  survived by two sons, Eric, of Arlington, Mass., and Jonathan, of Taunton, Mass.; a daughter, Ann Weil Richards, of Alstead, N.H., and a brother, Robert Ehrenfeld, of New York City.       
         Susan K. Kamen, an engineer for the military and, in a second career, a vice  president at the New York Life Insurance Company, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Kamen, who also maintained a home in Wainscott, L.I., was 59.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Harry P. Kamen, the chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.         Mrs. Kamen graduated from Smith College in 1957 and from Yale with a master's degree in science and physics in 1958. She spent the next six years as  a radar engineer with Sperry Gyroscope's Advanced Studies Department in Lake Success, N.Y. She held patents on radar receivers. At New York Life, she was a vice president for information systems.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kamen is survived by two daughters, Katherine K. Berkowitz of Bethesda, Md., and Abigail K. Holland of Manhattan; her parents, Thelma and Murray Klein of Brooklyn, and a brother, Eric Klein of Manhattan.       
         Marie-Helene de Rothschild, one of Europe's most imaginative hostesses, whose activities were a major part of the Paris social season for many years, died on  Friday at her home in Ferrieres, 20 miles northeast of Paris. She was 65 and had suffered for three decades from an incurable degenerative arthritic ailment.         Baroness de Rothschild, whose husband, Baron Guy de Rothschild, is dean of the French branch of the banking family, was well known in the world of fashion  and was particularly renowned for the dinners, balls and benefits she organized. Many were held at Chateau Ferrieres, the former Rothschild mansion that now belongs to the French state. The house in which the Baroness died was built on the estate after the chateau had been given to the Government.         The Baroness, who enjoyed creating fantasies for her social occasions, once  greeted 150 guests at a dinner (Diner de Tetes Surrealistes, whose invitations had to be read in a mirror) dressed as a stag at the kill, with a mask of towering antlers and pear-shaped diamond "tears" on her face.         At a ball she gave at Ferrieres for 1,600 people, the chateau was covered in  white muslin to make it look like a huge diamond-studded cobweb. A gala for the  Paris Ballet transformed the Palais Garnier into a woodland, with trees and vines climbing to the ceiling. At another function, her Bal Proust, celebrating  the 100th anniversary of Marcel Proust's birth, Cecil Beaton took guests' photographic portraits.         "When she has made up her mind about something, there is nothing on earth that can deter her," her husband once said.         The daughter of Baron Egmont van Zuylen de Nyevelt de Haar, a Dutch diplomat, and an Egyptian mother, the Baroness was educated at Marymount College in New York.         On a trip to Paris shortly after leaving school, she met and married Count Francois de Nicolay. They were divorced six years later after she had met Baron  de Rothschild and he, too, had decided to obtain a divorce. The Rothschilds were married in 1957 in a civil ceremony in New York -- "to allow the tempest we had  stirred up by a double divorce to subside a little," the Baroness once recalled.         After Ferrieres was donated to the Government, the Baroness did most of her entertaining at her Paris residence, the 18th-century Hotel Lambert on Ile St.-Louis. Her guests included a cross-section of international society, business and the arts -- the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor, Yves Saint Laurent, Oscar de la Renta and Andy Warhol.         "A good way of making people happy is to allow them to meet their opposites," she once said.         Nan Kempner, a New York socialite and a longtime friend, said, "She had enormous intelligence and curiosity and she wanted to see and do everything."         When France nationalized Banque Rothschild in 1981, the Baron moved to New York for a short time. Although the Baroness's illness made traveling difficult, she worked with an interior decorator on refurbishing their Upper East Side apartment.         The Baroness was also a major supporter of French couture and for many years  was in the front row at important shows. She was president of the committee that organized the 1973 Divertissement a Versailles, an event at which American designers were not only introduced to Europeans but also upstaged their French counterparts.         Survivors include her husband; two sons, Philippe de Nicolay, and Edouard de  Rothschild of Paris; a stepson, David de Rothschild of Paris, and a brother, Teddy van Zuylen of London.       
         Audrey Cohen, an innovative educator for more than 30 years and president and founder of Audrey Cohen College, died on Sunday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said Alida Mesrop, acting president of Audrey Cohen College.         Despite her diminutive and seemingly frail stature, Ms. Cohen was a powerhouse of energy when scorning the rigidity and failures of the contemporary educational system and proposing how to reform it.         Her central idea -- that education must never be abstract but must be closely linked with clearly understood purposes -- attracted wide interest, especially among individuals and institutions serving members of minority groups, immigrants and the disadvantaged seeking access to the mainstream of American society.         At present, Audrey Cohen schools enroll about 20,000 elementary and secondary school students at locations in five states (Arizona, California, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee), and some 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students in Manhattan at 75 Varick Street.         All of these institutions practice what Ms. Cohen described in a recent interview as "purpose centered" instruction. Her theory, she explained, is that  students learn best when they use their knowledge and skills to achieve a stated purpose.         In the early grades, she said, an entire class guided by a teacher may focus  on a single purpose, like finding ways to work together. Older students plan and carry out individual programs aimed at purposes like "We work for safety" or "We help people through the arts."         College-level students devote each semester to a more complex purpose in classes like "Values and Ethics," in which they study history, literature and government to extract ethical ideas, and "Self and Others," for the study of arts and writing, to develop productive relationships with people of all ages and cultures.         "Instead of teaching, let's say, the works of Schopenhauer or Rousseau," she  said, "our college students concentrate on a purpose such as 'Values and Ethics' in which they may read passages from the writings of Schopenhauer, Rousseau and  others which are relevant to the study of values and ethics. That way, it has a  deeper meaning to the students."         Asked if approaching the classics with relatively narrow and invariably positive preconceptions might distort their meaning, Ms. Cohen insisted that students at her institutions are encouraged to read more than just assigned passages. "Our approach helps students to fit things together," she said.         Her methods have attracted considerable interest and support among educators  throughout the country. Since 1992, Audrey Cohen College has received substantial grants from the New American Schools Development Corporation, a private, nonprofit organization based in Arlington, Va., that supports research  to find ways to revitalize teaching.         This year the college has been selected for support by the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit organization that advises the states on education policy.         Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Ms. Cohen graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh, and later did postgraduate work at George Washington University.         In 1958, recognizing that college-educated women restricted by child rearing  needed jobs with flexible work schedules, she founded Part Time Research Associates, a social science research corporation.         In the 1960's, Ms. Cohen became aware of the nation's shift from a manufacturing to a service economy, and the lack of training to meet the new requirements. This awareness led to her founding the Women's Talent Corps, which prepared numerous women for careers in such fields as social work, mental health services, occupational therapy and paralegal work.         Soon the Talent Corps became the College for Human Services, and there Ms. Cohen developed the ideas that led in 1964 to the founding of Audrey Cohen College, with its emphasis on practicality and purpose.         Ms. Cohen is survived by her husband, Dr. Ralph Wharton of Manhattan; two daughters, Winifred Alisa Cohen-Smith of Manhattan and Dawn Jennifer Cohen Margolin of Piedmont, Calif., and a brother, Carl Cohen of North Haven, Conn.       
         Margaret Rockefeller, who worked on behalf of farmland conservation, the American Farmland Trust, the New York Botanical Garden and the New York Philharmonic, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 80 and the wife of David Rockefeller, former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         The cause was complications from heart surgery, a family spokesman said.         Although she served on numerous boards and was involved in fund raising for  a number of projects, Mrs. Rockefeller, who was known as Peggy, maintained a low profile, preferring to remain in the background and devoting much of her time to causes that were more worthy than fashionable.         Particularly concerned with agricultural issues and the environment, she was  a founding board member of the American Farmland Trust and the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, serving as chairman for many years. She was also a member of the Nature Conservancy and the National Historic Trust.         In the mid-1970's, Mrs. Rockefeller began to buy and raise cattle, first on Bartlett Island in Maine, near the Rockefeller summer home in Seal Harbor, and then at Pocantico, the family home in Tarrytown, N.Y. In 1980, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller bought four farms in western Columbia County, N.Y., where Mrs. Rockefeller became an accomplished farmer, raising purebred Simmental cattle.         "I always loved the country, farming and animals," she said in an interview with The New York Times soon after the purchase of the Columbia County farms. She read all she could about farmland preservation until "little by little, I was trapped," she said         In 1992, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller announced an agreement with the American Farmland Trust and the Columbia County Land Conservancy that would place under protection for perpetuity almost 2,000 acres of their Hudson River Valley property.         Mrs. Rockefeller made substantial contributions to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the New York Philharmonic and was a trustee from 1953 to 1970.         Mrs. Rockefeller was also a member of the Board of Managers of the New York Botanical Garden. She came up with the idea for and helped finance the garden's  series of six illustrated books on America's wildflowers. She organized the National Committee for the Wild Flowers of the United States, which raised some  $500,000 for the project.         In 1988, Mrs. Rockefeller opened the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden, a two-acre enclave of some 2,700 roses. The restoration of the original 1915 garden designed by Beatrix Jones Farrand was supported by a $1 million gift from Mr. Rockefeller.         Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller received the Pillar of New York Award, given by the  Preservation League of New York State, last fall.         The daughter of Francis Sims and Neva van Zandt Smith McGrath, Mrs. Rockefeller was born in New York and grew up in Mount Kisco. She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and the Chapin School in New York. She met her future husband in the early 1930's and they were married in 1940 in Bedford, N.Y. The couple celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary last September.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six children, David Jr., Abby  Rockefeller and Neva Goodwin, all of Masschusetts; Peggy Dulany of New York, Dr. Richard of Maine, and Eileen Growald of California; a brother, Sims McGrath of Tenants Harbor, Me., and 10 grandchildren.         Correction:  March 28, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Margaret Rockefeller, conservationist and philanthropist, misidentified the museum of which her husband, David Rockefeller, is chairman emeritus. It is the Museum of Modern Art, not the Metropolitan Museum.       
         Martha Keehn, a social worker in India and Africa, died on April 5 at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 73 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         From 1952 to 1961, Mrs. Keehn directed social welfare projects for the Indian Cooperative Union, helping organize handicraft and other small industries in the villages of India.         A graduate of Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, Mrs. Keehn received  a master's degree from Columbia University in 1946.         She is survived by her husband of 50 years and co-worker, Thomas Keehn; a daughter, Deborah Keehn Black of Manhattan; five sons, Jonathan, of Grass Valley, Calif., David, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Benjamin, of Holliston, Mass., Adam, of Queens and Burkina Faso, and Joel, of Peekskill, N.Y.; a brother, William McKee, of Lafayette, Calif.; two sisters, Beatrice Watson, of Barstow, Calif., and Margaret Seder, of Stonington, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Mary Perot Nichols, the strong-willed former head of the television and radio stations operated by New York City, and a former columnist and city editor of The Village Voice, died yesterday in the hospice of the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her family said.         A friend and ally of Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, for 40 years, Ms. Nichols twice served as president of the WNYC Communications Group, with two radio stations, WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM, and a television station, WNYC-TV, Channel  31, licensed and partly financed by the city.         Ms. Nichols's most lasting professional contribution may have been the creation of the WNYC Foundation in the late 1970's, founded to attract private funds so the communications group could survive despite dwindling city financing. The foundation is awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission to buy WNYC-AM and FM, which are to remain public stations. Last week, the F.C.C. cleared the way for the city to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to the ITT Corporation and Dow Jones, which plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation.         Under Ms. Nichols's leadership, the radio station became an important contributor to the city's cultural life and a major producer of programs for National Public Radio, including "Kids America," a live call-in program for children that won several broadcasting awards.         Mayor Koch first appointed Ms. Nichols to head WNYC Communications in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, when budget-conscious politicians called  for sale of the stations. She not only kept them going but also began station renovations.         When she resigned after two years to become director of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she tossed off a tart farewell: doing creative work  for the city-owned stations was, she said, "a little like trying to cook a gourmet meal with glue on the kitchen floor."         Ms. Nichols left WNYC because of a disagreement with Mayor Koch when he insisted that the radio station run "The John Hour," in which the names of nine  men convicted of patronizing prostitutes were read over WNYC-AM. Mr. Koch theorized that the embarrassing exposure would cut into the prostitution trade and also argued that the Mayor should be allowed to control programming. "The John Hour" ran only once, but there was an outcry, and Ms. Nichols was made "uncomfortable," Mr. Koch said.         But he wooed her back to lead the communications group from 1983 to 1990, when Mayor David N. Dinkins replaced her with his own choice. She then became a  visiting professor of journalism at New York University, a post she held until her death.         Born in York, Pa., Mary Perot grew up near Philadelphia and in Buffalo. Friends say her Main Line family offered her a choice: she could have a "coming-out tea" or a college education. She selected college and in 1948 graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science.         She lived with her husband and three children in Greenwich Village, and was involved in local issues, particularly the effort to stop Robert Moses from putting a road through Washington Square Park. She kept nudging Dan Wolf, a founding editor of The Village Voice, to write about the park. He encouraged her to write about the danger to the park herself, and she did.         Soon she became a mainstay of the young newspaper, first as a reporter, then  as author of "Runnin' Scared," a column about city politics.         A competitive writer with a streak of indignation -- "Mary had the kind of anger that made abolitionists," said a former colleague, Jerry Tallmer, the writer -- she wrote extensively about organized crime and political corruption and was among the loudest critics of the Lower Manhattan Expressway and then Westway. Neither was built.         "Mary had spies everywhere," said Clark Whelton, a former Voice reporter who  is now a speechwriter for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "She seemed to know things  other people never found out. She would do the legwork herself, sit through long meetings, read documents nobody else would read, make connections nobody else would make."         Before she left the paper for good in the mid-1970's, she took two years off  to serve as a public relations aide in the city's Parks Department. It was a heady time, during Mayor John V. Lindsay's first term, and the energetic Parks Commissioner, Thomas P. F. Hoving, staged happenings -- concerts and other events to draw the public to the once placid parks.         "In the revolution of 1966, Mary was a key player," said Henry Stern, the current Commissioner of the Parks Department who was then its executive director. "Hoving was brand new to city government, but she knew all about it. He got the nickname Thomas P. F. Hoving, P. F. for Publicity Forever, but Mary Nichols made it happen."         Ms. Nichols soon grew disillusioned with Mr. Hoving and Mr. Lindsay, who became one of many favorite targets in her columns once she returned to The Voice in 1968.         As The Voice's city editor, she encouraged young writers and seemed to thrive on feuds with politicians and colleagues. Some accused her of trying to promote  the interests of Mr. Koch, her old friend. She acknowledged that she often agreed with him, but asserted that "when I disagreed with him, I let him have it."         Shortly after The Voice's founders sold it in the mid-1970's, a new editor dismissed Ms. Nichols. In 1977, she became communications director to Mayor Kevin S. White of Boston for just under a year. Then, after Mr. Koch's election  that year, she took on the WNYC job.         Ms. Nichols's marriage to Robert B. Nichols, a writer, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eliza Nichols of Williamsburg, Va., and Kerstin Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; a son, Duncan, of Thetford, Vt.; a brother, Charles Perot, and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Rosamond Haas, a professor of linguistics whose interests ranged from American Indian languages that were dying to the prehistory of languages and modern Thai, died on May 17 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         She suffered a long illness, according to the University of California at Berkeley, where she retired as professor emerita in 1977.         She, along with a handful of graduate students, was trained at Yale University by Edward Sapir, the legendary linguist and anthropologist, and became a force behind the Survey of California Indian Languages. Financed by the State Legislature, the project provided the wherewithal for sending qualified graduate students into the field for studies of the spoken native American word.         The program, started as a pilot project in 1949, surveyed cultures and languages presumably doomed to oblivion. In 1953, the survey of surviving Indian tongues became official, and the graduate department of linguistics was established on the Berkeley campus.         In the 1950's and 1960's, Dr. Haas used the survey for intensive explorations of the native languages in California and beyond. Such efforts inspired more than 40 dissertations and the careers of a generation of ethnolinguists.         Dr. Haas was a graduate of Earlham College in her native Richmond, Ind. She received a degree in comparative linguistics at the University of Chicago in 1931 and a Ph.D. at Yale in 1935. Her dissertation was on Tunica, an Indian language once spoken in what is now Louisiana.         She then delved into fieldwork with various other endangered or extinct species: Natchez, the only known member of its family of languages, as well as several of the Muskogean branch-offs, like Creek-Seminole.         As the entry of the United States into World War II loomed, she started working with the Thai language. She helped prepare Thai materials for the armed  forces and taught the language in a special training program at Berkeley, an experience that led to her appointment as an assistant professor of Siamese and  linguistics in 1947. She was promoted to professor of linguistics in 1957.         Her books in print include "Language, Culture and History: Essays" (Stanford  University Press, 1978), "Prehistory of Languages" (Mouton, 1978), "Thai Vocabulary" and "Thai System of Writing" (Spoken Language Service).         Dr. Haas is survived by a brother, Robert Haas, of Elkhart Lake, Wis.       
         Constance Sullivan Carden, who helped plan Alice Tully Hall and was on the boards of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, died on Thursday at her Manhattan home. She was 86.         Mrs. Carden was born in Manhattan, a daughter of Walter S. Sullivan, a New York Times advertising manager. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and from Bryn Mawr College.         She studied lieder singing in the 1930's and worked for the Office of Strategic Services, translating captured Nazi documents, in Washington during World War II. She was a singer during, and for some years after, the war.         Mrs. Carden was on the Philharmonic board from 1958 to 1978 and was chairwoman of its education committee, which developed programs to bring classical music into New York City public schools.         She was on the planning committee for Alice Tully Hall for several years before the hall opened, in Lincoln Center, in 1969. In that capacity, she mainly helped Alice Tully, the philanthropist for whom the building is named, raise funds for its construction. Mrs. Carden was on the board of the Chamber Music Society from 1969 to 1991.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. George A. Carden; three sons, Dr. George  Alexander Carden of Palm Beach, Fla., William of Manhattan and Timothy of Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Constance of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and a sister, Jeanet Curtis of New Haven. Her brother, Walter Sullivan, a former science editor of The Times, died in March.       
         Janet A. Sloane, a fashion director who helped bring haute couture headware from Europe to upscale American stores, died on April 20 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 82.         Beginning in the early 1940's, Ms. Sloane was a stylist, scout and vice president of Madcaps Inc., a Manhattan millinery and accessories company founded by her brother and partner, Alfred Z. Solomon. She worked there until Mr. Solomon sold the business in 1992.         As president of Madcaps International, Ms. Sloane was a regular at fashion shows in Europe, Tokyo and Hong Kong, where she sought new trends in designs, colors and fabrics.  She was among the first to adapt the millinery designs of Givenchy, Yves St. Laurent and other Europeans for the American market.         Ms. Sloane was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College in 1934. She was a supporter of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its Costume Institute. She was also a conservator of the New York Public Library and a member of the Corporation of Yaddo, the artists' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She was a founding member of the Fashion Group International and the Fashion  Round Table, two organizations for industry executives, and a member of the Soroptomists, an international women's community service alliance.         She is survived by her brother.       
         Patsy Montana, whose yodeling-cowgirl songs made her a pioneer in country music, died on Friday at her home in San Jacinto, Calif., The Associated Press reported. She was 81.         Ms. Montana had her biggest hit, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," in 1935, the first million-selling hit for a female country singer. It brought an assertive female voice to country music, as she announced her readiness to "rope and ride" and sang whooping high notes. Ms. Montana remained active for a career that lasted six decades.         Ms. Montana, who original name was Rubye Blevins, was born in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, and grew up in Hope, Ark., hearing the music of Jimmie Rodgers, country's "blue yodeler." She moved to California in 1930 with an older brother, and began performing on radio there after winning a talent contest. She joined the revue of a well-known country singer, Stuart Hamblen, in 1931, working with  a group called the Montana Cowgirls; Hamblen renamed her Patsy. She made her first recordings as Patsy Montana in 1932, and in 1933 she moved to Chicago to perform on WLS radio with the Prairie Ramblers.         She appeared regularly on the "National Barn Dance" program and recorded for  the American Record Corporation, usually accompanied by the Ramblers; she relocated with them to WOR radio in Manhattan in 1935. Along with "I Want to Be  a Cowboy's Sweetheart," which she wrote, her hits included "Shy Anne from Old Cheyenne," "The She Buckaroo," "Rodeo Sweetheart" and "I Wanna Be a Western Cowgirl." In 1939, she appeared with Gene Autry in the movie "Colorado Sunset."         During the 1940's, she recorded with the Sons of the Pioneers and the Light Crust Doughboys, and had a hit with "Goodnight, Soldier" during World War II. She returned to Arkansas in 1948, performing on radio there and at the Saturday-night "Louisiana Hayride" in Shreveport, La. When her husband, Paul Rose, was transferred to California, the family moved to the West Coast, and Ms. Montana went into temporary retirement during the 1950's.         But she returned to touring in the 1960's. In 1964, she made an album with a  band that included Waylon Jennings, little known at the time, on lead guitar. In the 1970's and 80's, she made albums for folk and bluegrass labels like Birch, Old Homestead and Flying Fish.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Beverly Losey, both of San Jacinto, and two brothers, Ira Blevins of Mena, Ark., and Kenneth Blevins of Florida.       
         Pilar Lorengar, a Spanish soprano who was best known for her portrayals of Mozart heroines but whose repertory ranged from zarzuela to Puccini, Verdi and Wagner, died on Sunday at the Park Sanitarium in Berlin. She was 68 and lived in Berlin, where she was a star of the Deutsche Oper for more than 30 years.         Hans Boon, her publicity representative, said the cause was breast cancer.         Miss Lorengar had a bright, distinctive sound that was not to all tastes. Her detractors often pointed to her wide vibrato, a characteristic that is shared by many Spanish singers and has been described by Ms. Lorengar's admirers as an expressive shimmer. The vibrato aside, she was an attractive and vibrant singer who created a sense of feminine vulnerability in roles like the Countess  in "Le Nozze di Figaro," Dona Elvira in "Don Giovanni" or Mimi in "La Boheme," but could also be a commanding Tosca and a lively Fiordiligi in "Cosi fan Tutte."         Although she sang with orchestras and opera companies all over the world, and made recordings with many conductors and ensembles, she was unusual in that she  considered a single company, the Berlin Deutsche Oper, her artistic home. Miss Lorengar made her debut there in Orff's "Carmina Burana" in 1958, when the company was called the Berlin City Opera, and quickly became a favorite of Berlin audiences and critics. When the company opened its new house in 1961, it  was with a production of "Don Giovanni" in which she sang Donna Elvira.         Miss Lorengar sang most of the major Mozart roles in Berlin, as well as Wagner's Elsa in "Lohengrin" and Eva in "Die Meistersinger," the title roles in Puccini's "Manon Lescaut," "Madama Butterfly," "Tosca" and "Suor Angelica," and Verdi's Desdemona in "Otello," Violetta in "La Traviata" and Alice Ford in "Falstaff." She was made a lifetime member of the Deutsche Oper in 1984, when the company staged a 25th-anniversary gala for her. And it was in Berlin that she gave her last operatic performance, as Tosca on June 9, 1990.         She also performed often at the Metropolitan Opera, where she made her debut  as Donna Elvira in 1966. At the Met she sang several of the Mozart, Puccini, Verdi and Wagner roles that were also in her Berlin repertory, as well as Antonia in Offenbach's "Conte d'Hoffmann," Micaela in Bizet's "Carmen" and Agathe in Weber's "Freischutz." Her last appearance at the Met was as Fiordiligi in 1982. Her last appearance in New York was a recital at the 92d Street Y in 1987.         Miss Lorengar was born Pilar Lorenza Garcia -- Lorengar is a combination of her middle and last names -- in Saragossa, Spain, on Jan. 16, 1928. She became fond of singing after she joined the choir of the convent school she attended as a child, and was smitten with zarzuela when she heard it through the earphone of a homemade radio made for her by a neighbor. Before she undertook formal vocal studies, she was hired by Radio Saragossa as a member of its zarzuela troupe.         In the mid-1940's, Miss Lorengar moved to Madrid, where she studied with Angeles Ottein and sang in a zarzuela company for several years before she decided to change her focus to the more conventional operatic roles. She made her international opera debut, as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro," at Aix-en-Provence, in 1955. The same year she made her American debut in a concert version of Granados's "Goyescas" with the Little Orchestra Society in New York.  She made her American operatic debut as Liu in Puccini's "Turandot" at the San Francisco Opera in 1964, and maintained a close relationship with that company over the next 25 years.         Miss Lorengar's discography includes recordings of Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice," Mozart's "Zauberflote" and Verdi's "Traviata" (all on London Records) and Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" (on Deutsche Grammophon).         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jurgen Schaff, and a brother, Luis Garcia Seta, of Madrid.       
         Marjorie Gross, a writer and producer of the television series "Seinfeld," who also wrote a humorous article about her ovarian cancer in The New Yorker in  April, died of the illness on June 7 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 40.         Ms. Gross was born in Toronto and got her start doing stand-up comedy in local clubs. She moved to New York City, where she was one of a group of female  stand-up comedians, who were then a relative rarity, performing at Catch a Rising Star, the Comic Strip and the Improvisation.         In 1981, Ms. Gross broke into television as a writer for the sitcom "Square  Pegs," with Sarah Jessica Parker. She also appeared on "Late Show With David Letterman." Then in 1994, she joined two old friends, Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, as a writer for "Seinfeld."         Even after her ovarian cancer was diagnosed two and a half years ago, Ms. Gross kept working. "Jerry put a cot in her office for her so she could lie down," her brother Jonathan said.         Among the "Seinfeld" shows Ms. Gross wrote, with Peter Mehlman, was the shower head episode, which was rebroadcast on Thursday. The episode was an extended riff on the drawbacks of environmentally approved low-flow shower heads. One by one, the show's characters made their appearance with flattened hair because their showers lacked enough pressure to rinse out shampoo.         In her New Yorker article about having ovarian cancer, a disease that killed  her mother, Ms. Gross made the illness sound like nothing more than a vast practical joke. In the piece, titled "Cancer Becomes Me," she made light of some of the darker aspects of her illness, noting the way doctors tend to use different analogies when describing tumors in women and men. "They found a tumor that they said was the size of an orange," she wrote. "See, for women they use the citrus fruit comparison; for men it's sporting goods: Oh, it's the size of a softball, or in England, a cricket ball."         She listed some "advantages" to being sick, including, "You automatically get called courageous," and, "Everyone returns your calls immediately: having cancer is like being Mike Ovitz."         Besides her brother, of Toronto, she is survived by her father, Jules Gross,  and another brother, Adam, both of whom also live in Toronto.       
         Lucille Darvin Maurer, a Maryland legislator whose expertise in public finance led her to the post of State Treasurer, died on Monday at her home in Silver Spring. She was 73.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Maurer, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County for 18 years in the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, Maryland's legislature.         The General Assembly elected her Treasurer in 1987. Stricken by her fatal illness, she resigned in January.         Mrs. Maurer, a native of New York City, graduated in economics from the University of North Carolina and earned a master's degree in general studies at  Yale.         She is survived by her husband of 51 years, Ely Maurer; three sons, Stephen B., of Swarthmore, Pa., Russell A., of Pepper Pike, Ohio, and Edward N., of Lido Beach, L.I.; a brother, Eugene Darvin of Pearl River, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.       
         Margaret Bronson (Peggy) Clark, who designed the lighting for more than 60 Broadway productions, including "Brigadoon," "Bye Bye Birdie" and "Auntie Mame," died on Wednesday at her home in Lexington, Ga. She was 80.         She died after a series of strokes, said Elmon Webb, a friend.         Ms. Clark helped make lighting design a profession on Broadway and was one of the first women to achieve a career in the field. "She was a pioneer in creating the field," said Mr. Webb, a business agent for United Scenic Artists,  the union that represents lighting, scenic and costume designers.         Through the 1930's, lighting design was a relatively informal process, usually the province of electricians.  Ms. Clark got her first job as a lighting designer on Broadway in 1941. Her work caught the attention of Brooks Atkinson,  the drama critic of The New York Times.         She worked as an assistant to Oliver Smith on "On the Town" in 1944. Her work tended toward the naturalistic, not the experimental. "Peggy Clark's lighting gives the production a cool appearance," Mr. Atkinson noted in a 1958 review of  "The Threepenny Opera."         Ms. Clark designed the lighting for a number of George Abbott's shows, including "Paint Your Wagon," a revival of "Pal Joey," and "Wonderful Town." "George Abbot liked plenty of light downstage," Ms. Clark told The New Haven Register in 1955, "because that's where he plays all the comedy scenes."         Dame Judith Anderson, for whom Ms. Clark designed the lighting for the 1947 production of "Medea," demanded simply to "be seen," Ms. Clark said. The equipment arrived late, there was no time to rehearse and "Ms. Anderson usually  left the spot just before the light got to it."         Ms. Clark was born in Baltimore to an academic family. Her father, Dr. Eliot  R. Clark, was later a professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania. Ms. Clark wanted to be an actress, but, she told The New Haven Register, "I grew so tall I was cast only in men's parts."         In 1935, she graduated from Smith College. She went on to Yale, where she studied in the Department of Drama and Design, getting her master of fine arts degree in 1938.         In 1968, Ms. Clark was elected president of the United States Scenic Artists, Local 829, the first woman to hold that job. She taught lighting design at Smith College in 1967 and 1969, and at Yale Drama School in 1969 and 1970.         For many years, she lived in Brooklyn Heights, where she kept bulldogs. She was a president of the French Bull Dog Club of America.         Ms. Clark's husband, Lloyd R. Kelley, a theatrical electrician, died in 1972. She is survived by a brother, Douglas N. Clark, a professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens.       
         Lily Auchincloss, a philanthropist and major supporter of the Museum of Modern Art, the American Academy in Rome and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Alexandra Herzan.         Mrs. Auchincloss was well known in New York cultural and social circles as an active and generous supporter of the arts with a keen interest in architecture and design.         A trustee at the Museum of Modern Art since 1971, she served on more than one-third of the museum's many trustee committees, including those of painting and sculpture, drawings and prints and illustrated books, and had been chairwoman of the museum's architecture and design committee since 1981.         In the 1990's, the several exhibitions she helped to finance included those of the architects Louis I. Kahn, Rem Koolhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as "Light Constructions" and "Cy Twombly: A Retrospective."         In 1994, the Modern named the Lily Auchincloss Center for Architecture and Design, a research facility, and 18 architects donated drawings to the collection in her honor. Terence Riley, chief curator of the department of art and architecture, said: "She was not a passive philanthropist. Her generosity came from a belief that the world could be a better and more beautiful place." Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern, said Mrs. Auchincloss was "one of the great, great trustees of our museum and involved with every aspect of its life."         Mrs. Auchincloss was born on April 5, 1922, in Newark. Her father, Arnold Louis van Ameringen, who was born in Holland, founded the International Flavors  and Fragrances Company. Her mother, Hedwig Pfaltz van Ameringen, who died last month at the age of 95, was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic.         Although Mrs. Auchincloss's first cultural interest was music, her affinity for architecture and design was kindled at Radcliffe College, where she met Philip Johnson, formerly head of the department of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, and the architect Marcel Breuer, with whom Mr. Johnson was studying  at Harvard. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe in 1944.         From 1944 to 1958, Mrs. Auchincloss worked in New York City as an editor on magazines and newspapers, including Look, The World-Telegram, The Herald Tribune, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar and McCall's. In 1956, she married Douglas Auchincloss, a writer at Newsweek. They were divorced in 1979.         A lifelong Episcopalian, Mrs. Auchincloss became a trustee of St. John the Divine in 1975, where she founded a committee that supported the cathedral's presentations of art and music. She was especially interested in large free concerts and financed the first performance of Liszt's "Christus" Oratorio in 100 years in 1979 at the cathedral.         In 1991, Mrs. Auchincloss served on the jury for the competition for the design of the cathedral's new wing, which was won by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.         In 1977, Mrs. Auchincloss became the first woman to join the board of the Cooper Union. She also served on the board of Japan Society, and was a director  of the Municipal Arts Society and a Fellow for Life of the Morgan Library.         A member of the board of the American Academy in Rome since 1982, she was a major contributor to the renovation of the Academy's McKim, Meade & White building in Rome.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a brother, Henry P. van Ameringen of Manhattan; a sister, Patricia Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., and a granddaughter.       
         Laurel Weiner, a national associate and former national vice president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on June 2 at Portsbridge Hospice in Atlanta. An Atlanta resident, she was 68.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Weiner, a native of Brooklyn, attended the University of Georgia. She devoted most of her spare time to volunteer work for civic organizations and the cause of Zionism. She was a delegate to three World Zionist Congresses and a leader in many national, regional and local Jewish groups.         She was on the board of the Atlanta Community Council and the Community Planning Council. She was also a former president of the Southeast Region of Hadassah.         Mrs. Weiner is survived by her husband, Charles J., a daughter, Toby White, two sons, Barry and Steve, a sister, Miriam Komesar, and a brother, Saul Weinberg, all of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.       
         Emma Bowen, a lifelong advocate for community causes and the rights of minorities whose reach extended to Washington, where she challenged broadcasters' and politicians' hiring practices, died last Monday at her home in Washington Heights. She was 81.         Mrs. Bowen was an outspoken advocate of the disenfranchised and vulnerable, particularly the young, as president of the Foundation of Minority Interests. The group was an outgrowth of a volunteer organization, Black Citizens for Fair  Media, that focused on the employment practices of broadcasters and their portrayal of blacks on television.         The group set up advisory boards at WABC-TV and WNBC-TV in 1972. As a result, the stations hired community-affairs directors and took steps to adjust  their programming, employment and training policies. A former neighborhood worker in the mayoral campaign of John V. Lindsay, she was later executive secretary of what is now the city's Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services.         Mrs. Bowen was born in Spartanburg, S.C., and moved to New York during the Depression to live with an aunt. She graduated from Fordham University.         Mrs. Bowen's husband, Marion, died in 1943. She is survived by three daughters, Marian Sanderson of Queens, Antoinette Perlez of Manhattan, and Gloria Jones, also of Queens; a brother, William Smith of Manhattan; four sisters, Lillie Ruth and Christine of Queens, Sarah of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Eunice of Spartanburg; seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Bessy Pupko, who spent 50 years locating witnesses to Nazi war crimes, died on July 26 at her home on the Upper West Side. She was 99.         She worked for the World Jewish Congress until a few years ago, searching for people willing to testify at trials in West Germany and the United States. She kept the names of Holocaust survivors on cards in endless file boxes in her midtown Manhattan office, and placed small ads in Yiddish newspapers asking witnesses to come forward.         Among the cases for which Miss Pupko found witnesses was that of Andrija Artukovic, Minister of the Interior for the Nazi puppet state of Croatia in World War II. Mr. Artukovic was extradited to what was then Yugoslavia in 1986.  He was sentenced to death for war crimes there, but died in prison in 1988 before the execution could be carried out..         "In the days before computers, she was better than computers," said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress. "She knew where everything was and where everyone was."         Miss Pupko grew up in Vilna, Lithuania, which was then part of Poland, and became a teacher at a school for Jewish children. In 1936, she immigrated to the United States, joining her two brothers. The rest of her family stayed behind.         Her father died before the war, and she lost her mother, a sister, a brother  and two nephews in the Holocaust. Her only immediate survivor is a sister, Rachela Malezin of Teaneck, N.J.       
         Judge Genevieve Blatt, the first woman to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania and to serve on the state's appellate court, died on Thursday at a  retirement home in Hampden Township, Pa. She was 83 and a former resident of Harrisburg.         She spent more than 50 years in public service, starting as secretary and chief examiner of the Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission in 1938.         She became a force in Pennsylvania's Democratic Party as a member of the Democratic National Committee and the party's National Policy Committee. She attended every Democratic National Convention from 1932 to 1972 and served as vice chairwoman of the Pennsylvania delegation at the 1956 convention. She was the secretary of the State Democratic Committee from 1948 to 1971.         She was an assistant city solicitor in Pittsburgh in the 1940's. In 1954 she  was elected Secretary of Internal Affairs, a statewide office. She was re-elected in 1958 and 1962 but lost her bid for a fourth term in 1966.         She won a tight race in a party primary to run for the United States Senate in 1964 but then lost the election by 50,000 votes to the Republican incumbent,  Senator Hugh Scott.         In 1972, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her to fill an unexpired term on the  Commonwealth Court, the state's appeals court. She won election on her own the next year, was re-elected in 1983, became a senior judge a year later and retired from the bench in 1993.         For her charitable, cultural and social work for the Roman Catholic Church, she received three papal honors, including the Lady Grand Cross in the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem.         Genevieve Blatt was born in East Brady, Clarion County. Majoring in economics, she received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh before graduating from its law school.         She is survived by two sisters, Sister Mary Frederick of Greensburg, Pa., and Bernadette B. McCloskey of Los Angeles, and a brother, Joseph A. Blatt of Pittsburgh.       
         Catherine S. East, a little-known Government researcher who became the quiet inspiration for the National Organization for Women and a persistent goad to the nascent feminist movement, died on Saturday at Kendal at Ithaca, a retirement community in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 80.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Elizabeth R. East, her daughter.         Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book ''The Feminine Mystique'' is credited with helping to spark the modern women's movement, said yesterday that Ms. East was a ''prime mover'' in the 1966 birth of NOW.         ''She and others kept saying how what we needed is an N.A.A.C.P. for women,'' Ms. Friedan said. ''I thought of myself as a writer, not an organizer, but Catherine kept emphasizing that what was needed was outside pressure on the Government.''         Characteristically, Ms. East worked without public acknowledgment and was often so far in the background that friends in the movement started calling her ''Deep Throat.''         As a longtime researcher for the Labor Department and later as executive director for various Federal commissions and task forces on the status of women, she came to know scores of accomplished, professional women, in and out of Government, who were concerned about sex discrimination and became important in the feminist movement.         Moreover, she had an access to and command of facts on employment practices, workplace discrimination and other matters that she often used to disarm critics who opposed feminist legislation. But as a Government employee, she felt she could never take a public, vocal role, friends and colleagues said.         Vera Glaser, a journalist, recalled that at a news conference early in the Nixon Administration, she pointedly asked the new President whether he would appoint more women to his Administration. Ms. Glaser was surprised to get a letter later in which Ms. East wrote, ''I gather from the tone of your question, you might be interested in a few statistics.'' It was the beginning of a fruitful relationship that helped Ms. Glaser write a widely noted five-part newspaper series on discrimination against women. ''A lot of the facts came from Catherine,'' Ms. Glaser said.         In 1963, Ms. East helped write and research a Government report titled ''American Women,'' which called for the establishment of Federal and state commissions on women. It was at a conference of these commissions in June 1966 that a group of women came to Betty Friedan's hotel room to urge the formation of the group that, four months later, became NOW. Although Ms. East was not present in the hotel room, she had urged most of the women there to lobby Ms. Friedan.         ''Catherine would just persist and persist until it happened,'' recalled Mary Eastwood, a retired staff lawyer for the Justice Department and a friend of Ms. East.         The daughter of Ulysses Grant Shipe, a bank president in Huntington, W.Va., and Bertha Woody Shipe, a homemaker, Ms. East was educated at Marshall University in Huntington, where she received a bachelor's degree in history in 1943.         In addition to her daughter Elizabeth, of Ithaca, Ms. East is survived by another daughter, M. Victoria East of Seattle; a brother, Charles D. Shipe of Great Falls, Va., and a granddaughter.       
         Geulah Abrahams, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at the Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. She was 65 and had homes in Princeton and New York.         She died after a brief illness, her husband, Elihu Abrahams, said.         Ms. Abrahams performed with the Paul Taylor Dance Company in 1963 and also danced with Mary Anthony, Pearl Lang and the Merry-Go-Rounders. She was on the dance faculty at Princeton University from 1975 to 1985. While there, she choreographed a production of Stravinsky's ''Soldier's Tale'' in collaboration with Michael Graves, the architect and designer, and Michael Pratt, the conductor.         She collaborated frequently with Paul Lansky, the composer, with whom she presented a retrospective program in New York and Princeton in 1995. She also choreographed for theater and opera with various directors, including Wilford Leach, Michael Kahn and Edward Berkeley.         Ms. Abrahams founded her own modern dance company, Geulah Abrahams Danceworks, in 1985. Interested in the connections between art and science, she created ''Dances in Physics'' in 1989 and presented the work at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles. She also taught and choreographed at the Ballet West summer school in Aspen, Colo.         During the past three years, she taught at the Aspen Music Festival and was the resident choreographer of the Aspen Opera House.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of New York City and David, of Cambridge, Mass., and by a brother, Shmuel Govreen of Jerusalem.       
         Lillian Clark, a singer who performed with many stars of the big-band era and helped preserve the work of her husband, the composer and arranger Sy Oliver, died on Tuesday at her home in New York City. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, according to a statement from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, of which she was national treasurer.         Ms. Clark, whose original name was Autilia Ventimiglia, was born in Scranton, Pa. She studied at the Juilliard School, intending to become a classical pianist. But when one of the Clark Sisters left that popular singing group in the 1940's, she auditioned, got the job and changed her name.         She met her future husband when the group was performing on Tommy Dorsey's radio show on WOR. After Mr. Oliver died in 1988, she catalogued his music, most of which she donated to New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and to the Smithsonian Institution.         Ms. Clark appeared on Perry Como's television show in the 1950's and recorded with Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey and Louis Armstrong. She was also one of the original Ray Charles Singers and sang with other groups, including the Ray Conniff Singers and the Norman Luboff Choir.         She is survived by a son, Jeffry James Oliver of New York City, and a brother, Sal Ventimiglia.       
         Virginia Corwin Brautigam, a scholar who helped pioneer the field of comparative religion and who traveled the world in search of knowledge about Eastern faiths, died on Monday at a retirement community in Newtown, Pa. She was 95.         Dr. Corwin, as she was know to her students and colleagues, was a professor emeritus of religion and biblical literature at Smith College, where she taught from 1930 until  retiring in 1966.         Originally a specialist in early Christianity, Dr. Corwin's intellectual curiosity about Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam and Shinto was stimulated by a course in world religions she taught as a young assistant professor.         Her studies took her far and wide. She walked through central India with the disciples of Vinoba Bhave, a spiritual successor of Mohandas K. Gandhi who traveled on foot from village to village preaching asceticism and social reform.         In Kyoto, Japan, she was taken in by Buddhist monks as a visiting resident in their temple.         And in Vietnam she hitched a ride with the United States Army, which flew her to isolated villages deep in the interior so she could study their Buddhist traditions.         Virginia Corwin, who was born and raised in East Orange, N.J., graduated from Wellesley College, Union Theological Seminary and Yale University, where she received a doctorate in history in 1937 after studying under Robert Calhoun, Roland Bainton and Richard Niebuhr.         Her dissertation, ''St. Ignatius and Christianity in Antioch,'' was published by Yale Press in 1960.         Dr. Corwin's broadening interests, which went from the study of early Christianity to include more world religions, was emblematic of her generation of theologians. She began teaching when the field of comparitive religion was still young.         ''Her generation was involved in the forming and shaping of a whole new field of study, especially for liberal arts colleges, that changed the focus of study from normative Christianity to a whole range of religions,'' said Diana L. Eck, a professor of comparative religion and Indian studies at Harvard University, who took Dr. Corwin's class at Smith and became a lifelong friend.         Dr. Corwin remained single until she was 74 years old, when she married Herman Brautigam, a friend and colleague she had first met 40 years earlier as a student at Yale. Mr. Brautigam died in 1985.         Dr. Corwin, who lost her eyesight in the 1970's, continued teaching courses in religion to her neighbors at Pennswood Village, her retirement home, until this March.         She is survived by a brother, Theodore S. Corwin of Chatham, N.J., three step-children, and nine step-grandchildren.       
         Doris Rosenblum, an indefatigable combatant in 40 years of struggle over housing, education and development on Manhattan's Upper West Side, died of cancer yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71.         Ms. Rosenblum served for the last six years as the borough historian of Manhattan, and her positions of civic authority included her job as district manager of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side from 1983 to 1990. But the impact of the woman who came to embody neighborhood advocacy in New York City extended far beyond that conferred by official titles.         Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said in an interview yesterday that ''she was and always will be remembered as the Mayor of the Upper West Side.''         Ms. Rosenblum was so deeply involved in the affairs of her neighborhood -- from the decentralization of authority over the public schools in the 1960's to the development battles of the 1980's -- that many people regarded her as an irreplaceable force.         ''She is as much a part of the West Side as the No. 2 train,'' Ronnie Eldridge, the City Council member, said when Ms. Rosenblum retired from Community Board 7 in 1990.         Born June 30, 1925, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and raised in the South Bronx, she first engaged the political establishment of the Upper West Side when she moved there in 1959 with her husband, Paul, a printer for The New York Times and a scholar in African history.         Within months of her arrival, she began investigating conditions in her children's public school, joined and was elected president of the neighborhood branch of the United Parents Association and led a campaign for smaller schools under greater neighborhood control. That culminated in 1971 when she was part of the group that founded the first alternative high school on the Upper West Side, the West Side High School.         Ms. Rosenblum's most far-reaching impact may have been in her fight to maintain housing for low-income and middle-income people amid the massive urban renewal projects, including Mitchell-Lama apartments and public housing that  were built on the Upper West Side during the 1960's and 1970's.         ''She always wanted to make sure that urban renewal was not urban removal,'' her husband said. Ms. Rosenblum's base of influence included the Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council, where she served as a board member and president, and later Community Board 7, where she became a member in 1971.         After 12 years as a board member, she was appointed district manager of the board in 1983, making her a central mediator, fact finder and advocate at a time when the Upper West Side was awash in huge development plans. Until 1990, when she resigned, she coordinated neighborhood opposition to several projects, including huge developments planned for the site of the New York Coliseum and Donald Trump's Riverside South property.         Ms. Rosenblum was appointed as the official historian of Manhattan -- a voluntary post -- by Ms. Messinger in 1990.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Rosenblum is survived by her mother, Fannie Koppelman of Manhattan; a daughter, Beth, of Ashland, Mass., and a brother, Frank, of Queens. Her son, Peter, was killed in an auto accident in 1981.       
         Helen Kushnick, who managed Jay Leno's rise from small-time comic to star of the ''Tonight'' show but was dismissed as the program's executive producer four months after Mr. Leno succeeded Johnny Carson as host, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Jane Rosenthal, a friend. She was 51.         After Mr. Leno took over ''Tonight'' in May 1992, the show received an avalanche of criticism and ratings began to fall. In late September, NBC executives dismissed Ms. Kushnick after she was accused of demanding that guests booked by ''Tonight'' not appear on rival talk shows.         Ms. Kushnick, whose maiden name was Gorman, grew up in Harlem. Her first job was as secretary to the producer David Gerber at 20th Century Fox in New York. She moved to Hollywood with Mr. Gerber and eventually found work at International Creative Management, the talent agency, where she rose from secretary to agent.         In the mid-1970's, she formed a partnership with her husband, Jerrold Kushnick, an entertainment lawyer, and established herself as a manager. Her clients included Mr. Leno, whom she spotted in 1975 at the Comedy Store, Elayne Boosler, Jimmie Walker and for a brief period David Letterman.         Ms. Kushnick's role in Mr. Leno's rise to host of ''The Tonight Show'' was chronicled in ''The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno and the Network Battle for the Night,'' by Bill Carter, a television reporter for The New York Times. In an HBO movie based on the book, the role of Ms. Kushnick was played by Kathy Bates.         Ms. Kushnick, contesting Mr. Carter's version of events, filed a lawsuit for libel, which was settled out of court.         Mr. Kushnick died of cancer seven years ago. The couple had twins, one of whom, Samuel, became infected with the virus that causes AIDS during a blood transfusion and died at age 3 in 1983. Ms. Kushnick became a campaigner in the fight against the disease.         Ms. Kushnick is survived by a daughter, Sara Rose (the other twin), and a brother, Joseph Gorman, of New York City.       
         Loret Miller Ruppe, who was head of the Peace Corps longer than anyone else in the organization's 35-year history and was credited by many with restoring much of its Kennedy-era vitality, died yesterday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 60.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ruppe was appointed director of the Peace Corps by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. She served for eight years, after which she was appointed Ambassador to Norway by President George Bush. She held that post until 1993.         When Mrs. Ruppe took over the Peace Corps, it was very much in need of revitalization. Its volunteer force had shrunk from a high of more than 15,000 in 1966 to about 5,000, and its budget had been cut.         The agency had had seven directors in the previous decade, and it had lost much of its independence after President Richard M. Nixon folded it into an umbrella agency called Action in an effort to downgrade some programs inherited from his Democratic predecessors.         In 1982, Congress restored the corps' independence. Mrs. Ruppe tried new approaches to bolster the volunteer ranks. She decided that the youthful idealism of, say, a 22-year-old English major might be nicely balanced by the experience and special skills of, say, an agricultural scientist in his mid-50's who did spot-welding in his spare time.         She pressed the search for volunteers with specific skills -- tending forests, stocking fish ponds, setting up sanitation systems -- and encouraged special arrangements with colleges and universities. Some colleges offered financial concessions to students with heavy debts if they joined the Peace Corps; others offered programs combining work on master's degrees with service in the corps.         On Jan. 10, 1985, Mrs. Ruppe went on national television to say that the Peace Corps was looking for 600 volunteers to do famine-relief work in Africa. Within a few days, more than 7,000 people contacted the agency.         Under Mrs. Ruppe, the Peace Corps developed short-term programs, enabling teachers, doctors and farmers to do volunteer work overseas while on sabbaticals or even long vacations. When Mrs. Ruppe became director, 3 percent of the volunteer were over age 50; six years later, 11 percent were.         During her tenure, Mrs. Ruppe (pronounced ROO-pee) visited volunteers in more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Pacific where the Peace Corps was involved. The agency started new programs or restarted dormant ones in Sri Lanka, Haiti, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and Cape Verde.         Mrs. Ruppe drew praise from R. Sargent Shriver, the Democrat and Kennedy in-law who was the Peace Corps' first director.         ''She's the kind of Republican we tried to recruit into management when we first started out,'' Mr. Shriver said in 1982.         Mrs. Ruppe had impeccable Republican credentials. Her husband, Philip, was a Republican Congressman from Michigan from 1967 to 1979. Mrs. Ruppe was Mr. Bush's campaign manager in the 1980 Michigan Presidential primary and was a leader of the Reagan-Bush campaign in Michigan that fall.         Mrs. Ruppe was born in Milwaukee. Her great-grandfather, Frederick Miller, founded the Miller Brewing Company. Her father, Frederick C. Miller, who had been captain of Notre Dame's 1928 football team, was the company chairman. He and a son, Frederick Jr., were killed in a plane crash in 1954.         Mrs. Ruppe attended Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Marquette University in Milwaukee.         Surviving are her husband, whom she married in 1957; five daughters, Antoinette Greenberg, of Chicago; Adele, of Mexico City; Loret Jr., a former Peace Corps volunteer, of Davis, Calif.; Katherine, of Manhattan, and Mary, of Bethesda; five sisters, Clair Krause and Gail Wray, both of Mequon, Wis.; Kate, of Springfield, Ill.; Carlotta Johnson, of Britain, and Adele, of Brunswick, Me.; a brother, Carl Miller, of Miami, and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Wilson Nies, a former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, died on Wednesday, her 71st birthday, at Beebe Hospital in Lewes, Del. She lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was head injuries suffered in a bicycling accident a week earlier in Henlopen Acres, Del., the court said.         President Jimmy Carter named Judge Nies to the United States Customs and Patent Appeals Court in 1980, and President Ronald Reagan reassigned her to the Federal Circuit when that jurisdiction was established in October 1982. She became Chief Judge in June 1990, and served in that post until March 1994. She took senior status last November.         Judge Nies, a native of Birmingham, Ala., graduated from the University of Michigan in 1945 and, three years later, from Michigan Law School. She was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1948 but moved to Washington that year to work at the Justice Department.         She later was a counsel in the Office of Price Stabilization, but took eight years off in the 1950's to rear a family. Before her court appointment, she was a partner in Chicago and Washington law firms.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, John Dirk Nies; two sons, J. Dirk, of Rockville, Md., and Eric W., of New York City; a daughter, Nancy N. Sloan of Las Vegas, Nev.; her mother, Lida Wilson of Rockville; a brother, George E. Wilson, and two grandchildren.       
         Martha Phillips, a notable force in luxury fashion retailing for more than 60 years and an early supporter of many of today's leading designers, died on Saturday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98.         Martha, as she was generally known (Miss Martha to her employees), was for many years a well-known front-row figure at major fashion shows in New York and Europe and a booster of, among others, Valentino, Halston, Geoffrey Beene, James Galanos, Pauline Trigere, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and Zandra Rhodes at the beginning of their careers.         Her customers at her elegant Park Avenue and Palm Beach salons were some of the world's richest and most socially prominent women, who often filled in checks that ended in three and four zeros.         There were four Martha shops in the 1980's, when sales were said to be almost $40 million. A boutique in the Trump Tower closed after several years, and a bankruptcy filing in 1992, attributed to the economy, resulted in the shuttering of the Park Avenue salon and another in Bal Harbour, Fla. The Palm Beach shop, operated by Mrs. Phillips's daughter, Lynn Manulis, remains, and Mrs. Phillips went in almost daily until shortly before her death.         ''There was never anybody like her and there won't be anyone like her,'' Ms. Trigere said yesterday. The designer, who did business with Mrs. Phillips for almost a half-century, added, ''She developed a special knowledge of who her customer was -- from the very first client, she knew what she was doing.''         Mr. Beene described Mrs. Phillips as ''an icon to an audience of a more frivolous era of dressing -- steeped in vanity and femininity.''         And Mr. de la Renta called it ''the end of a whole era'' and Mrs. Phillips ''the last of the great ladies of retailing with a true grasp of the luxury business and a tremendous sense of quality.''         A small, meticulously groomed woman with carefully coiffed hair who wore signature David Webb jewelry, Mrs. Phillips did not hesitate to pop into fitting rooms as her customers tried on clothes. More often than not, she did not ask what they wanted but told them what they should have. More often than not, they listened. Although the salon had a workroom  for alterations, Mrs. Phillips also did not hesitate, on occasion, to get on her knees to pin a hem.         There was never a time when she was not fascinated by fashion, Mrs. Phillips said in a 1983 interview on the 50th anniversary of her business. Born Martha Rollins in Brooklyn, where her father had a shop called the Star that specialized in hand-tailored clothes and riding clothes, she asked to help in the business one day when she was 8. Her father got a crate, placed it behind the counter and she stood there after school, selling lace blouses.         ''People were so amused, they would buy,'' she recalled.         At 18, she married Phillip R. Phillips, a manufacturer of ready-to-wear clothing and in the early 1930's she opened a shop on the 12th floor of a Madison Avenue building. Despite the Depression, she refused to buy anything for the shop that would sell for less than $100.         ''I did very well,'' she said. Her customers included Marjorie Merriweather Post, who brought in her jewels to make certain that both the color and the neckline of the dress were appropriate for showing them off properly. Other clients were Doris Duke, Brooke Astor, Gloria Vanderbilt and Diana Ross.         Mrs. Phillips remained there for 20 years, leaving only when the building was torn down. She then leased space in what was the Savoy Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue. After that building was sold to the General Motors Corporation, she balked at a shop she was offered downstairs in the plaza of the new building to be built on the site, saying, ''Martha's customers never shop in cellars.''         Shortly after, she and her daughter, who joined her several years earlier, found a location at Park Avenue and 58th Street where in plush  surroundings she coddled her customers with tea and cookies while models paraded the clothes or saleswomen carried them out.         Mr. Phillips died in 1981. Besides  her daughter, who lives in Palm Beach, Mrs. Phillips is survived by a son, Herbert R. Phillips, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Milton Rollins of Brooklyn, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview when she was in her mid-80's, Mrs. Phillips, who was chairwoman of her company -- her daughter was president -- said she had no intention of ever retiring.         ''I like to think that what we're doing is being impresarios, finding talent,'' she said. ''I like the excitement.''       
         Brenda Forbes, a character actress who gave vital support onstage to Katharine Cornell, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne and other stars during a career that lasted more than 60 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         She died of cancer, said Erik A. Hanson, a friend.         Miss Forbes, who began acting with the Old Vic in 1927, made her Broadway debut with Cornell in ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street'' in 1931. She played Wilson, Elizabeth Barrett's loyal maid, which became her signature role. She toured in the play and was in the 1945 revival.         Even when her parts were small, Miss Forbes was always noticeable: an expert at accents, she created eccentric characters, many of them maids and nurses, and made them definably her own. As an Englishwoman transplanted to the United States, she was frequently called upon to act in plays by Shaw, Wilde and Noel Coward, but also played American roles.         Miss Forbes was known for her work in comedy, in musicals as well as plays. In ''Three to Make Ready,'' one of three Nancy Hamilton revues that she did on Broadway, she spoofed women shopping for shoes, learning Russian and trying to explain Wagnerian opera. As a satirist, she was compared with Beatrice Lillie and Fanny Brice.         Her career extended into the 1990's, with the movie ''The Jerky Boys'' in 1995. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1985 in ''Aren't We All?,'' a revival of the Frederick Lonsdale comedy starring Rex Harrison and Claudette Colbert. With characteristic panache, she played a clergyman's repressed wife.         Born in London in 1909, Miss Forbes came from a theatrical family: her mother, Mary Forbes, was an actress and her brother Ralph Forbes was an actor. As a teen-ager, she left England to join her mother in Hollywood and did seven plays at the Vine Street Theater. Then Guthrie McClintic cast her in ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street,'' and also asked her to play Prossy in ''Candida'' and Lady Montague in ''Romeo and Juliet.''         In ''Leading Lady,'' Tad Mosel's biography of Cornell, the author said that was McClintic's ''first brilliant, triple-threat piece of casting.''         Miss Forbes followed with a long string of Broadway plays, including ''Pride and Prejudice,'' ''Storm Over Patsy,'' ''Heartbreak House,'' ''Ring Around the Moon'' and ''Quadrille'' (with the Lunts). She also acted in ''The Reluctant Debutante,'' ''The Loves of Cass McGuire'' (with Ruth Gordon) and ''The Constant Wife'' (with Ingrid Bergman). In 1976, she played Mrs. Higgins in the Broadway revival of ''My Fair Lady.''         Her films included ''Mrs. Miniver,'' ''White Cliffs of Dover'' and ''This Above All.'' She also appeared in three television movies with Katharine Hepburn (''The Man Upstairs,'' ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' and ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry''). For many years, Miss Forbes divided her time between New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, where she acted at the Goodman Theater.         For 39 years she was married to Merrill Shepard, a Chicago lawyer who died in 1986. She is survived by 10 nieces and nephews.       
         Bibi Besch, an actress who appeared on many of television's most popular shows and was on the board of the Screen Actors Guild, died last Saturday at the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles. Ms. Besch, who lived in Los Angeles, was 54.         She died of cancer, said her sister-in-law, Jenny Besch of Manhattan.         Ms. Besch, a daughter of the actress Gusti Huber and the mother of the actress Samantha Mathis, appeared on such television series as ''Northern Exposure,'' ''E.R.,'' ''L.A. Law,'' ''Law and Order,'' ''Night Court,'' Family Ties,'' ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' ''Coach,'' ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her performances in ''Doing Time on Maple Drive'' and on ''Northern Exposure'' won her Emmy nominations in 1992 and 1993.         Ms. Besch's film credits included ''Steel Magnolias,'' ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ''Tremors,'' ''Betsy's Wedding,'' ''Who's That Girl'' and ''The Promise.'' A director of the Screen Actors Guild from 1990 until her death, Ms. Besch served on many of the organization's committees, among them the national communications committee, the women's committee, the agents relations committee and the women's health task force.         Ms. Besch was born in Vienna, came to the United States as a child and grew up in the Westchester County towns of Mount Kisco and Chappaqua.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Besch is survived by her brother, Andrew Besch of Manhattan; two sisters, Drea Gillogly of Los Angeles and Christina MacDonald of Monceaux, France, and her stepfather, Joseph Besch of Manhattan.       
         Juliet Prowse, the tall, leggy dancer with the sultry smile and the bee-sting lips who became a tabloid celebrity when she offended Khrushchev and captivated Frank Sinatra, died yesterday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 59 and had been a staple of Las Vegas nightclub acts, television specials and touring musicals for more than 30 years.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, a spokesman said.         Although Miss Prowse was an accomplished dancer who had been trained in classical ballet in London and South Africa and had had a successful career in Europe before being discovered in Italy by the choreographer Hermes Pan, Miss Prowse was an unknown in the United States when Mr. Pan recruited her to appear with Mr. Sinatra and Shirley Maclaine in the movie-musical ''Can-Can.''         Then came the day in 1959 when Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, visited the ''Can-Can'' set in Hollywood during a celebrated state visit to the United States and pronounced the entertainment ''immoral.''         Within hours Miss Prowse's scantily-clad image was in virtually every newspaper in America and she was being hailed by Hollywood as another Betty Grable.         Miss Prowse, who knew propaganda when she heard it translated (Khrushchev had been all smiles during the visit, she said), was nonplused. ''Let's face it,'' she said. ''the cancan is a pretty raucous number. It's not exactly 'Swan Lake.' ''         Although she won enthusiastic praise for both her acting and her dancing in ''Can-Can,'' Miss Prowse was two decades late for the era of the big Hollywood musical and she appeared in only a few, largely forgettable movies, among them, ''The Second Time Around,'' with Debbie Reynolds; ''Who Killed Teddy Bear?'' with Sal Mineo, and ''G.I. Blues,'' with Elvis Presley.         But the Khrushchev remark, a romance with Mr. Sinatra (they were engaged for six weeks in 1962) and a simultaneous fling with Mr. Presley made her an enduring darling of the gossip columns and enhanced her popularity as a television and night club performer.         Juliet Prowse, whose father was a British manager for Westinghouse who died when she was 3, was born in Bombay, India, and grew up in South Africa, where she emerged as such a skilled dancer that at 14 she was the ''baby ballerina'' star of the Festival Ballet in Johannesburg.         At 17 she was pursuing her career in London, but had to switch to modern dance when she grew too tall, 5-7, for her partners. ''When I got on my toes,'' she said, ''some of those male partners were way down there.''         A part in the London production of ''Kismet'' led to an engagement at a celebrated topless dance club in Paris, but Miss Prowse was not allowed to appear uncovered.         ''I was considered English,'' she later said. ''In those shows, nudity was the guarded right of the French and German girls.''         She later appeared in Madrid, helped form what amounted to a traveling review and was dancing in Rome when she was spotted by Mr. Pan, Fred Astaire's longtime collaborator, who was so impressed by her grace and skill that he told friends she was the best feminine dancer he had ever seen.         Miss Prowse never became a major movie star, but in the years after ''Can-Can,'' she was rarely out of work partly because, for all her gossip column celebrity, she was a hard-working, disciplined professional whose performances were almost always well received.         She made a virtual career touring in ''Mame' and won such acclaim for her Las Vegas performance in ''Sweet Charity,'' in 1966, that the show was taken to London, where Miss Prowse won the British equivalent of a Tony Award.         After she broke off her engagement with Mr. Sinatra, Miss Prowse settled down to a series of long-term relationships but generally avoided matrimony. There was a brief early marriage she never talked about, and in 1980, just after giving birth to their son, she married John McCook, an actor. They were later divorced.         To those who worked with her, Miss Prowse's most striking feature was neither her long, shapely legs nor her dancing skills, but her sunny disposition and her perpetual good cheer even in the face of one disaster or another, like the time in 1987 when she was mauled by a leopard while rehearsing for a television special called ''Circus of the Stars.''         As her longtime manager, Mark Mordoh, noted yesterday, none of her friends were surprised that Miss Prowse was convinced that the same dedication and hard work that had brought her a successful show business career would lead to a victory over her cancer, discovered in 1994.         ''Even while she was getting chemotherapy,'' Mr. Mordoh said, ''she was teaching yoga classes.''         Miss Prowse is survived by her son, Seth McCook, of Los Angeles; her mother, Phylis Polte; a brother, Dr. Clive Prowse, both of Vanderbijl Park, South Africa, and her companion, B. J. Allen.

Then came the day in 1959 when Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, visited the ''Can-Can'' set in Hollywood during a celebrated state visit to the United States and pronounced the entertainment ''immoral.''         Within hours Miss Prowse's scantily-clad image was in virtually every newspaper in America and she was being hailed by Hollywood as another Betty Grable.         Miss Prowse, who knew propaganda when she heard it translated (Khrushchev had been all smiles during the visit, she said), was nonplused. ''Let's face it,'' she said. ''The cancan is a pretty raucous number. It's not exactly 'Swan Lake.' ''         Although she won enthusiastic praise for both her acting and her dancing in ''Can-Can,'' Miss Prowse was two decades late for the era of the big Hollywood musical and she appeared in only a few, largely forgettable movies, among them, ''The Second Time Around,'' with Debbie Reynolds; ''Who Killed Teddy Bear?'' with Sal Mineo, and ''G.I. Blues,'' with Elvis Presley.         But the Khrushchev remark, a romance with Mr. Sinatra (they were engaged for six weeks in 1962) and a simultaneous fling with Mr. Presley made her an enduring darling of the gossip columns and enhanced her popularity as a television and night club performer.         Juliet Prowse, whose father was a British manager for Westinghouse who died when she was 3, was born in Bombay, India, and grew up in South Africa, where she emerged as such a skilled dancer that at 14 she was the ''baby ballerina'' star of the Festival Ballet in Johannesburg.         At 17 she was pursuing her career in London, but had to switch to modern dance when she grew too tall, 5 feet, 7 inches, for her partners. ''When I got on my toes,'' she said, ''some of those male partners were way down there.''         A part in the London production of ''Kismet'' led to an engagement at a celebrated topless dance club in Paris, but Miss Prowse was not allowed to appear uncovered.         ''I was considered English,'' she later said. ''In those shows, nudity was the guarded right of the French and German girls.''         She later appeared in Madrid, helped form what amounted to a traveling review and was dancing in Rome when she was spotted by Mr. Pan, Fred Astaire's longtime collaborator, who told friends she was the best feminine dancer he had ever seen.         Miss Prowse never became a major movie star, but in the years after ''Can-Can'' she was rarely out of work partly because, for all her gossip- column celebrity, she was a hard-working, disciplined professional whose performances were almost always well received.         She made a virtual career touring in ''Mame' and won such acclaim for her Las Vegas performance in ''Sweet Charity,'' in 1966, that the show was taken to London, where Miss Prowse won the British equivalent of a Tony Award.         After she broke off her engagement with Mr. Sinatra, Miss Prowse settled down to a series of long-term relationships but generally avoided matrimony. There was a brief early marriage she never talked about, and in 1980, just after giving birth to their son, she married John McCook, an actor. They were later divorced.         To those who worked with her, Miss Prowse's most striking feature was neither her long, shapely legs nor her dancing skills, but her sunny disposition and her perpetual good cheer even in the face of one disaster or another, like the time in 1987 when she was mauled by a leopard while rehearsing for a television special called ''Circus of the Stars.''         As her longtime manager, Mark Mordoh, noted on Saturday, none of her friends were surprised that Miss Prowse was convinced that the same dedication and hard work that had brought her a successful show business career would lead to a victory over her cancer, discovered in 1994.         ''Even while she was getting chemotherapy,'' Mr. Mordoh said, ''she was teaching yoga classes.''         Miss Prowse is survived by her son, Seth McCook, of Los Angeles; her mother, Phylis Polte, and a brother, Dr. Clive Prowse, both of Vanderbijl Park, South Africa, and her companion, B. J. Allen.       
         The train carrying Japan's most famous young couple chugs into the station and out comes Princess Masako, all charm and elegance in a pale-green suit, waving to her picture-snapping fans and walking briskly, two steps behind the Crown Prince.         That is almost the only kind of public appearance that Princess Masako makes these days -- a quick swish from a train to a car, en route to a hospital or charity -- for she has virtually disappeared since her marriage three years ago.         After a wedding that captivated this country, a union filled with the promise of imperial renaissance, these days there is only silence.         Before she married, Masako Owada was the symbol of the new Japanese career woman, an attractive Harvard-educated diplomat in the Foreign Ministry, moving with professional ease in five foreign languages.         When she became the Crown Princess, she was the second commoner ever to marry into the imperial family. Many in this nation brimmed with the hope that she could help  update the Chrysanthemum throne, ushering into the modern age a dynasty that is the world's oldest and is shrouded in pageantry and tradition.         Now Masako-san, as the Crown Princess is often called, has not only virtually vanished from sight, but is also measured by a standard that is thousands of years old: her ability to bear a son.         For the couple, producing an heir is a big responsibility. The Emperor, Akihito, is said to be the 125th direct descendant in an imperial dynasty that reaches back 26 centuries -- although these claims reflect the triumph of faith over scholarship.         But without a son in sight, people are openly discussing the succession. After Akihito, the throne goes to the Crown Prince, Naruhito, but if he dies without leaving a son, it will go to his younger brother, Prince Akishino. Akishino, however, has only two daughters now; after him, there is no male descendant.         So Japanese imperial-watchers are debating the possibility of seeing Chrysanthemum throne go to a daughter. After all, the dynasty was spawned by a Japanese sun goddess, Amaterasu, and 8 of Japan's 125 emperors have been women.         The last female emperor -- the title of empress is reserved for the emperor's wife -- reigned for seven years until 1770. Then a century ago, the imperial code was changed to forbid a woman from ascending the throne. Parliament would have to pass a new law before a woman could become emperor, but if that happened, then there would be potential long-term heirs. At least for now, for example, the throne could go to one of Prince Akishino's daughters, Mako and Kako.         Though the Crown Princess is only 32, there is an old Japanese saying, ''Marry for three years, and bear no child, then it's time to leave!'' But in a country where divorce is still uncommon, any kind of parting in the imperial family is unthinkable.         If there is any overwhelming feeling these days that ordinary Japanese have for the Crown Princess, it is sympathy. They tend to identify more with her as a commoner than with the Prince, and do not often discuss publicly the Prince's role in producing an heir.         ''She married into a position where her responsibility is to give birth to a boy, and I feel for her,'' said Naomi Yamaha, 33, a computer engineer. ''Even as commoners, there is a lot of pressure on you to have a boy if you marry the oldest son.''         And the pressure is a thousand times more intense for the Crown Princess, living in a gilded imperial cage where her every move is watched and evaluated.         ''Indeed, being the wife in the imperial family has got to be the No. 1  source of stress,'' said Rihachi Iizuka, a prominent fertility specialist at Keio University. ''That's why caged animals like monkeys and pandas in zoos don't have as many babies as the ones out in the wild.''         Princess Masako's royal zoo keepers are the 1,100 administrators and servants who form the Imperial Household Agency, a bastion of conservatism and protector of tradition and ritual. It has not only cloistered  Princess Masako and the Crown Prince, but many say it has created a greater distance between the imperial family and the ordinary Japanese people.         ''The Japanese imperial family is not in step with the times, with the perception of the new generation of citizens,'' said Toshiaki Kawahara, who has written many books on the imperial household. ''Unless they mix with the ordinary people, the imperial family will be forgotten.''         Another of the imperial tasks is to build links with other countries, the kind of diplomacy for which the Crown Princess spent her life training. But the couple's last trip abroad was to the Middle East in January 1995.         Some people say that the cloak of silence the Imperial Household Agency has now wrapped around her may be an effort to play down her presence until the royal couple produce an heir. Others say it is the agency's method of easing stress.         ''The agency wants to preserve a mood of tranquillity for the couple,'' said Minoru Hamao, a former chamberlain to the Emperor and a private tutor of the Crown Prince. ''If she comes out in public, she'd be surrounded by the press, by photographers, and it would make her nervous.''         Masako's mother-in-law, the Empress Michiko, the first commoner to be brought into the imperial fold, suddenly collapsed nearly three years ago in an incident that left her unable to speak for several months. It is still not clear what caused it, but many people blame Japan's gossipy magazines for triggering the Empress' breakdown with unflattering accounts of her.         Many ordinary Japanese blame the Imperial Household Agency for transforming the Crown Princess from a sophisticated, highly educated traveler into a dainty flower who studies poetry and ancient rituals.         ''Some women were happy having Masako-san enter the family, hoping the imperial system itself might change, but I said it would not be like that,'' said Mikiyo Kano, a professor who focuses on women in history. ''She's totally ignored. Unlike an empress, Masako-san is a yome, the wife of a son, and according to Confucian patriarchy, a yome doesn't hold any role, not even a place in the family.''         It is hard to imagine a more backward step for one of Japan's most talented career women. And indeed for the moment at least, she seems to be receding from the wider public's interest.         ''I look up to the female Japanese astronaut and the women athletes at the Olympics,'' said Yoko Nishimura, 49, a furniture store owner. ''I don't look up to Masako-san.''         The new Masako-san does have die-hard fans, like Harumi Tadakawa, a 30-year-old housewife who has spent $60,000 following the Crown Princess around the country. At the train station, Mrs. Tadakawa was snapping pictures to add to her collection of nearly 5,000 photographs of the imperial family.         But other Japanese prefer to follow the exploits of crowned heads elsewhere.         ''I care more about the British royal family, and I'm interested more in Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana than in Masako-san,'' said Daisuke Sakaguchi, a 25-year-old clothing salesman. ''Whenever the imperial family gets sensational news coverage because of some ceremony, like Masako-san's wedding, for example, sure, I feel happy and want to congratulate them. But that's about it. The imperial family here is just too boring.''       
         Guillermina Rico, a lemon peddler who bargained her way to wealth and power as the head of a political machine she forged from the ranks of Mexico City's itinerant vendors, died on Wednesday of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 63.         In the market stalls and side streets she was known as La Jefa, the boss, and at her death her office walls were adorned with photos of the curly-haired matriarch, often wearing a trademark white apron, with senators, mayors, police chiefs and every Mexican president since Jose Lopez Portillo took office in 1976.         Today 2,000 people marched three miles from the city center to a weed-choked cemetery in a working class suburb, bearing Mrs. Rico's coffin to a plot wafting with the scent of lily and lavender and heaped with scores of wreaths. The trumpets of a mariachi sounded a dirge.         ''I feel like an orphan,'' said Pablo Ibarra, a 45-year-old vendor who accompanied her coffin. ''She helped me, and many others, to earn an honest living on the streets.''         In a 40-year career, Mrs. Rico led thousands of market peddlers through cycles of street war and peace with successive Mexico City mayors, who have repeatedly sought to clear the streets of the informal merchants who block sidewalks in front of tax-paying businesses. Sometimes the vendors have been removed to suburban markets, but always they have returned.         The vendors, whose ranks swelled during years of economic crisis as farmers lost their land and factory workers were dismissed, hawk everything from tortillas to tires to pirated American music tapes. Today Mexico City's central market is among the largest outlets in the world for contraband.         Mrs. Rico was born in 1934 in the downtown neighborhood of La Merced into a clan of street sellers. Both parents migrated to Mexico City during the Depression from outlying states. Guillermina's three brothers, Manuel, Fernando and Candido, also devoted their lives to street commerce, Roberto Hidalgo Lopez, one of Mrs. Rico's advisers said in a cemetery speech today.         Both of Mrs. Rico's parents died when she was a teen-ager, and Mrs. Rico was forced to give up school after fourth grade, Mr. Hidalgo said.         She began working the street at age 15, peddling lemons and avocados, and three years later, married another vendor: Salvador Sanchez Velazquez. They had four children.         In 1946, Mrs. Rico joined the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and eventually she organized the vendors into a powerful bloc that cast thousands of ballots for the governing party.         During the early years, Mrs. Rico's leadership was informal, but in 1965 she organized 500 merchants into the Civic Union of Street Vendors of Old Merced. Twenty years later, the union's ranks had swelled to 3,000, and by 1985 it stood at 7,000.         Mrs. Rico gained the power to assign the choicest market stalls, for which she charged a quota, and those and other revenues made her wealthy. The Chamber of Commerce estimate in 1988 that Mrs. Rico and other union leaders collected about $1 million annually.         She funneled vast sums into the pockets of city authorities, partly to forestall their periodic threats to remove the vendors. Some of her riches she channeled into social work, and she once responded to a reporter's question about what she had done for Mexico: ''Ask the priests in the downtown churches who is the one that helps them. Go to the shelters. Ask the drug addicts and the alcoholics undergoing rehabilitation.''         She is survived by her brother Candido, her four children, Silvia, Margarita, Isabel, and Salvador, all of whom live in Mexico City, and 16 grandchildren, Mr. Hidalgo said.       
         Laura Epstein, an educator in social work who was retired from the University of Chicago faculty, died on Sept. 18 at her home in Chicago. She was 82.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her brother, Robert.         Professor Epstein retired in 1985 after 18 years as an instructor and professor in the university's School of Social Service Administration. Her earlier work included serving as director of social work education and as casework supervisor in agencies in Chicago.         Much of her research involved the development of a short-term form of social work practice called the Task Centered Model. Later she studied aspects of the history of clinical social work in the 20th century.         Her writings include ''Helping People: the Task Centered Approach'' (Macmillan, 1992).         Born in Chicago, she received a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1934 from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in 1936 from its School of Social Service Administration.         She is survived by her brother, of Skokie, Ill.       
         Janice A. Burns, a writer and speaker on AIDS who sought to awaken and educate a wider audience, especially young people, to its realities, died of the disease on Sept. 28 at St. John's Hospital in Yonkers.         Mrs. Burns was 33 and a Yonkers resident, said Melinda Mullin, her associate and press agent.         Mrs. Burns was the author of ''Sarah's Song,'' the story of her life with her husband and former childhood sweetheart, William Burns, and their struggle to accept and live with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Mr. Burns died of AIDS in 1994.         Critics described the book, which was named for the child the Burnses never had, as both poetic and brutally specific, full of pain and anger, a plea for understanding and an exhortation to live life, come what may. The author contracted the virus from her husband, who had become infected during an earlier relationship.         ''Sarah's Song,'' published by Warner Books last year, had a hard-cover printing of 30,000 copies. The book came out in paperback on Oct. 1, with a printing of 50,000 copies.         Mrs. Burns, whose maiden name was O'Reilly, was born in the Bronx and graduated from Trinity College in Washington. She earned a master's degree in psychology at New York University and worked as a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at New York University Medical Center until her illness forced her to retire in 1992.         She played an active role in various organizations concerned with AIDS and last March delivered the keynote speech at the Westchester County Women's Annual Hall of Fame event. Since 1990 she had also pursued a mission she considered vital: speaking to thousands of high school students about her experience on behalf of Community Services in Westchester, an AIDS-related organization.         She is survived by her parents, Joan and John O'Reilly of Fishkill, N.Y.; two sisters, Dolores Rezendes of Duxbury, Mass., and Maureen Stano of Kansas City, Mo., and a brother, Steve O'Reilly of Brookfield, Conn.       
         Mimi Coleman Thompson, an officer and past board chairwoman of Planned Parenthood of New York City, who also had long associations with Hofstra University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, died on Wednesday at her home in Old Brookville, L.I. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Thompson, a member of one of New York's most historically prominent families, was a highly visible presence in philanthropy and community service for much of her life, both on Long Island and in New York City.         She was a founder, in 1987, fund-raiser and most recently vice president of the American Skin Association, with its headquarters in New York City. The organization supports research in dermatology and skin disorders and their cure.         Mrs. Thompson first worked as a volunteer for the American Red Cross in the 1950's, organizing blood donation campaigns.         In the 1960's, she was an officer and board member of what is now the Five Towns Community Center of Lawrence, L.I., a gathering place for underprivileged children. She also served as a trustee of the Lawrence Country Day School in Hewlett Bay Park, L.I. -- before its merger with Woodmere Academy -- and raised the money for a new gymnasium, whose construction she guided.         She then was vice chairwoman of the trustees of Hofstra. She was a force in the establishment of its law school and in making Hofstra one of the first universities in the state to be fully accessible to the handicapped.         At the medical center, she was, among other things, co-chairwoman for 14 years of the Visitors Day program, which informs the public of important medical advances.         She began her work for Planned Parenthood as a fund-raiser in the 1980's, serving as chairwoman from 1983 to 1987. At her death, she was the head of a committee concerned with the training of clinicians.         She was born Louise Stuyvesant Wainwright, a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch Governor who surrendered New Amsterdam to the British. For 36 years, she was married to Charles Payson Coleman, who was managing law parter of Davis Polk & Wardwell at his death in 1982.         She is survived by her husband of four years, William D. Thompson; three daughters, Linda Coleman of Southampton, L.I., and Penny Coleman and Susan C. Bynum, both of Manhattan; a son, Payson Coleman of Old Brookville; a sister, Patricia Bonicatti of Rome; a brother, Peter S. Wainwright of Scottsdale, Ariz., and nine grandchildren.       
         Julia Waldbaum, an effervescent personification of motherly concern, homey wisdom and business savvy who helped build a supermarket chain from a butter and egg store in Brooklyn, died in her sleep on Monday as her son held her hand in her apartment in Floral Park, Queens.         Mrs. Waldbaum, 99, who would have turned 100 on July 4, had been a longtime resident of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.         Late in life, even after nearly all her family's stock in the Waldbaum's supermarkets was sold to the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company in 1986, Mrs. Waldbaum  liked to keep an eye on the stores.         In the 1960's, her picture appeared on almost all of the 400 food products sold under the Waldbaum's label, along with recipes she had tested in her own kitchen.         ''They left me off the dog food and the bathroom tissue,'' she observed one day as she made one of her regular surprise inspections as self-appointed watchdog of the chain.         In a store on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, Mrs. Waldbaum, who was also the secretary of the company, told a produce clerk to discard a bruised grapefruit, or put it in with the reduced-price merchandise. She checked at the meat counter to see if anyone had poked through the plastic meat wrappers. ''When that happens, I have it rewrapped,'' she said.         She told how she grew upset when she saw long lines at the checkout counters and not enough checkers, and how she became angry when clerks forgot to say ''thank you'' to customers.         As she continued her tour, one of 30 she made each month, she brushed dust off cans of kidney beans and straightened an untidy display of marshmallows.         ''I'm really not too fussy about messy shelves, though,'' she said. ''That means we're selling.''         By the early 1980's, the chain was grossing $1.376 billion at 140 supermarkets in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. There was never a Manhattan store, she said. ''Manhattan has too many single people, rents are too high and there's no space for parking lots.''         Julia Leffel, the daughter of Harry and Anna Leffel, was born in Manhattan and reared in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. She was 12 when she met Israel Waldbaum. Known as Izzy, he was an immigrant from Austria selling butter and eggs in a little store established in 1904 at 911 DeKalb Avenue.         According to family legend, one day during World War I, Anna Leffel asked Izzy Waldbaum if he could get her some sugar, which was in short supply. Mr. Waldbaum found a 50-pound sack and offered to deliver it personally to her home. When he did, he encountered Julia. He realized that she was the girl who came to his store every day to buy milk, which she carried home in a pail.         In time, Izzy Waldbaum asked to carry the pail home for her. That was their courtship. When he was 28 and she was 21, they married, and Julia went to work in the store.         ''People used to stand three abreast to get into that store,'' she said with a faraway look in her eyes as she reminisced in 1967, 20 years after she was widowed and left with three children.         By the time Mr. Waldbaum died at age 55, the chain consisted of seven stores. When a store ran short of a product, Mrs. Waldbaum, the first woman in her family to have a driver's license, would put her children in the car, drive to a store with a surplus of the product and take some to the needy supermarket.         For years, much to the consternation of her family, she refused to have her telephone number unlisted. ''I like to have the customers call me, because a lot of them think Julia Waldbaum is an imaginary person like Betty Crocker,'' she said.         Away from the supermarkets, Mrs. Waldbaum was devoted to opera and the theater and was a benefactor of many charities.         She is survived by a daughter, Shirley Waldbaum Witkin of Glen Cove, L.I.; a son, Ira Waldbaum of Old Westbury, L.I.; a sister, Sylvia Goldman of Riverdale, the Bronx; a brother, Alfred Leffel of Syosset, L.I., 10 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Arlene Wanderman, an editor and public relations executive who was the American spokeswoman for the International Olive Oil Council, died on Monday at Beth Israel North Hospital. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause has not been determined, said Linda Russo, an associate.         In 1990, Ms. Wanderman founded Foodcom, a public relations company in Manhattan that specializes in food, wine and cooking equipment. The company's major account is the International Olive Oil Council, a nonprofit educational and promotional agency supported by the governments of many Mediterranean countries, which also set standards for olive oil.         Her career in food started at the Macfadden Group as women's service editor for such magazines as True Story, True Confessions and Photoplay. She then became the food and equipment editor of Ladies' Home Journal before embarking on a career in advertising and public relations.         Ms. Wanderman, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University and had a degree in metabolic dietetics from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         Her marriages to Bob Reiter of Boca Raton, Fla., and Philip L. Wanderman of White Plains, both ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, James K. Reiter of Hollywood, Fla.; her mother, Edith Rosenwasser of Boca Raton, Fla., and her brother, Stan Rosenwasser of Rehobeth Beach, Del.       
         Constance Woodruff, who was active in labor and women's issues and was a Democratic Party stalwart, died on Saturday at St. Michael's Medical Center in Newark. She was 74 and lived in West Orange, N.J.         The cause was cancer, said Jan M. Johnson, executive editor of City News in Plainfield, N.J., for which Mrs. Woodruff wrote political commentary until her illness was diagnosed in the spring.         Mrs. Woodruff was a Democratic National Committeewoman for two terms. She was co-chairwoman of the New Jersey delegation at the 1976 National Democratic Convention.         Six governors, starting with Gov. Richard J. Hughes in the 60's, named her to state commissions. In 1975, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed her the first chairwoman of the State Advisory Commission on the Status of Women despite objections to her strong partisan identification as the secretary of the State Democratic Committee.         She was the chairwoman of the commission for 16 years, traveling the state to foster similar bodies at the county level. She was twice elected to lead the national umbrella Association of Commissions on Women, of which she eventually became president emeritus. The national group advises state organizations, like the New Jersey Division on Women, on issues deemed important to women.         She was born in Newark, and was city editor of the Herald-News of Newark, a black-oriented weekly.         Later, during two decades with the International Ladies Garment Workers, she directed community relations for the union's eastern region.         Along the way, she graduated from Empire State College and got a master's in labor studies from Rutgers University.         She was an adjunct professor of labor studies at Rutgers-Newark and spent her last 10 years in education as director of public relations and development for Essex County College.         Mrs. Woodruff is survived by a sister, Gwendolyn Williams of Petersburg, Va., and a brother, Leon Rochester of East Orange. Her husband of 42 years, Bill Woodruff, died in April.       
         Hermine Baron, one of America's top-ranked female bridge players, died in Los Angeles on Sept. 27. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Arthur Baron of Los Angeles.         For the last 22 years, Mrs. Baron had more master points than any other female player, ending with 22,645 and the title of grand life master. From 1975 to 1983, she was ranked second among all players by the American Contract Bridge League, and was 10th when she died.         In 1964 and 1970, she won the McKenney Trophy, awarded for winning the most points in a calendar year.In 1964, she set a points record.         Mrs. Baron was a member of the United States Women's Team that took third place in the 1968 world championships in Deauville, France, and she competed in the World Women's Pairs Championship in 1978 and 1982. In national competition, she won the Life Master Pairs in 1966 and five other titles: the Women's Teams in 1964 and 1968; the Women's Pairs in 1968 and 1982, and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1963. She finished second seven times.         Mrs. Baron was born in Omaha and stricken with polio at the age of 13, after which she was confined to a wheelchair.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Jerry Hirschman of Chicago.       
         Ruth Waxman, who played a prominent role in Conservative Judaism, died on Oct. 18 at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 80.         She had suffered injuries in a fall at her home in Great Neck, L.I., earlier that week, her family said.         Mrs. Waxman was the wife of Rabbi Mordecai Waxman of Temple Israel in Great Neck. An early advocate of women's rights in Conservative Judaism, she lectured widely on the role of women in the synagogue.         From 1972 until two years ago, she was an editor of Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, published by the American Jewish Congress.         She was born in Palestine and brought as a child to the United States, where her family settled in Chicago. She graduated from the University of Chicago, from which she also received a doctorate in comparative literature. She taught literature there and at Adelphi University, at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University and, most recently, at the State University at Stony Brook, L.I., and at Queens College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, Rabbi Jonothan Waxman of Eberon, N.J., and David and Hillel Waxman of Great Neck; a brother, Rabbi Albert Bilgray of Tucson, Ariz., and five grandchildren.       
         Angela Romano Perez, an advocate for the disabled whose life was a model of the personal independence, responsibility and achievement she championed, died on Friday at the Cabrini Hospice in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan. Ms. Perez, a lifelong resident of the Upper East Side, was 49.         Her husband, Joseph, said the cause was breast cancer.         Ms. Perez, who was born with cerebral palsy, spent her life trying to change the prejudices that disabled people often encounter or even impose on themselves.         At her death, she was the program director of the Y.W.C.A. of New York City, for which she directed the Networking Project for People With Disabilities. ''The project was founded to provide young people with disabilities with positive role models because, particularly for young women with disabilities, there tends to be a lack of visible, appealing role models,'' said Madeline F. Beusse, a consultant who worked with Ms. Perez on the financing of the project. ''The project is about empowerment, boosting self-esteem and opening doors.''         Besides leading the Networking Project, which is paid for by the city's Youth Services Department and private donations, Ms. Perez designed and oversaw a study of the accessibility of health services for disabled women. Called ''Breaking Down Barriers: Eliminating Obstacles to Reproductive Health Care for Women With Disabilities'' and financed by the New York State Department of Health, the study is continuing. The findings and recommendations are to be presented by its board -- health care professionals, disability advocates and corporate and public officials -- at a conference in the spring.         Before taking the Y.W.C.A. post in 1988, Ms. Perez was the educational counseling coordinator for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, from 1983 to 1987.         Working to raise awareness of domestic violence against people with disabilities, she served on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's task force on domestic violence, giving a voice to some of the more vulnerable victims of abuse.         Ms. Perez was also on the board of directors of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled and a vice president of Women With Disabilities, both of which are advocacy and service organizations.         Combining advocacy with her love of travel, Ms. Perez attended the nongovernmental forum on women held in Beijing in conjunction with the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women last year. She went frequently to Canada to collaborate with the Disabled Women's Networ, and traveled as well to Japan, Thailand, Austria, Britain and Italy and throughout the United States.         On Oct. 5, her birthday, a personal letter of commendation from Hillary Rodham Clinton was delivered to Ms. Perez's room at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she had been under care since August. It was followed by a letter from the Mayor, commending Ms. Perez for the difference she had made in the life of New Yorkers.         Ms. Perez held two degrees from Hunter College: a Bachelor of Arts in psychology, awarded in 1978, and a Master of Science in education, awarded in 1983.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Stephen and Mary Romano, and her brother, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Ruth Diebold, a librarian who combined her professional interests with a personal dedication to culinary pursuits and so helped to preserve the legacy of James Beard, apostle of American cookery, died on Tuesday at her home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. She was 77.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         At her death Mrs. Diebold was vice president of the Nyack Library. She also was a former director. After Mr. Beard died in 1985, she volunteered to turn his Greenwich Village town house into a center for culinary arts.         She was a graduate of the University of Chicago and obtained a master's degree in library science from Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, William Diebold; four sons, David Corcoran of Northvale, N.J., John Corcoran of Red Hook, N.Y.; John Diebold of Nyack, and William Diebold of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Barbara Wick of Northfield, Ill.; a brother, Joseph Brody of Indianapolis; 11 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Louise Stack Duschl, a former artistic administrator for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, died on Wednesday at her home in Pittsburgh. She was 45.         The cause was cancer, said Patricia Wilde, artistic director of the ballet company.         Ms. Duschl began her professional career as a member of the dance faculty at Michigan State University, from 1974 to 1977.         She was the artistic director of Danceworks, the modern dance troupe of the Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which performed throughout the region through 1981.         After the disbanding of the company, she worked in another administrative capacity with the commission before joining the Pittsburgh ballet company in 1989.         During her five years there, she helped to found an innovative dance therapy program.         She is survived by her husband, Richard, of Nashville; three daughters, Gretchen Hannah of Nashville and Cary Louise and Rebecca Aileen, both of Pittsburgh; her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Stack of Hyattsville, Md.; two sisters, Judith Overman of Columbia, Md., and Carol Tilford of Fairfax, Va., and a brother, Kenneth Stack Jr. of Laurel, Md.       
         Elaine Anthony, a painter who specialized in lush semi-abstract landscapes, died on Oct. 26 at her home in West Redding, Conn. She was 53 years old.         The cause was cancer, her family said         Ms. Anthony was born in New York City, where her father, Jack Murray Anthony, was a cartoonist for The New Yorker and art director at Young & Rubicam. After earning an undergraduate degree from Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., she studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design.         In 1964, she married a Spanish architect, Pedro Sanchez de Move llan, and spent much of the next 20 years living in Mexico City, where her husband worked for the firm of Luis Barragan.         Ms. Anthony began her artistic career making wire sculptures, cloth banners and paintings on cloth, often executed as commissions for Mexican resorts. Her work matured to semi-abstract landscapes and collages, often executed in a loose painterly style.         She had her first Manhattan solo show in 1987, at the Stephen Haller Gallery in SoHo, and her first retrospective last winter, at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y.         Exhibitions of her work are on view at the Tremaine Gallery at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and the Stephen Haller Gallery.         Ms. Anthony's marriage ended in divorce in 1982. In 1991 she married Bernard Wharton.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her twin sister, the artist Carol Anthony of Sante Fe, N.M.; her brother, Jack M. Anthony of Seattle, and three children from her first marriage, Pedro Sanchez de Move llan of Middletown, R.I., Tessa Wohl of Stockbridge, Mass., and Mark Sanchez de Movellan of Hilversum, the Netherlands.       
         Meridel Le Sueur, who reported on the plight of the poor during the Depression and celebrated the free spirits of early Americans in her fiction for children, died on Nov. 14 in Hudson Memorial Hospital in Hudson, Wis. She was 96 and had lived in the hospital's residential unit in nearby St. Paul, Minn., for the last few years.         Miss Le Sueur, a native of Murray, Iowa, grew up among the radical farmer and labor groups that informed her youth, like the Populists, the Farmers Alliance and the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World. Her first story was published  in a literary magazine in 1927, and she kept writing into her 90's.         Her mother and stepfather, Marion Wharton and Alfred Le Sueur, were ardent socialists who imbued her with an idealism that never left her. Just beyond their Middle Western kitchen the world was filled with  eloquent radicals: Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Lincoln Steffens and Emma Goldman.         Largely self-taught, Miss Le Sueur teamed with kindred souls in literary communal relationships and, sent East by her mother, moved in with Goldman while attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She came to know John Reed and met Theodore Dreiser and Edna St. Vincent Millay at Mabel Dodge's literary salon.         She won acclaim in 1927 for her story ''Persephone'' and again in 1934 for ''The Horse,'' a strange, powerful novella. With her distinctly personal style of journalism, she rendered detailed observation with a sense of political urgency. She reported on bread lines and unemployment offices and on deserted mining towns and desolate farms.         Blacklisted during the McCarthy period, she continued to write, turning out experimental prose works, novels and poems and storing them in her basement in Minnesota.         Her highly praised children's books, in which she interwove history and regional lore in poetic prose, included ''Little Brother of the Wilderness: The Story of Johnny Appleseed,'' ''Nancy Hanks of Wilderness Road: A Story of Abraham Lincoln's Mother,'' ''Sparrow Hawk'' and ''Chanticleer of Wilderness Road: A Story of Davy Crockett.''         Miss Le Sueur's own wilderness relented as collections of her prose began to appear in the 1970's. Her recovery culminated in ''Ripening: Selected Work, 1927-1980'' (Feminist Press, 1982), a clear reflection of how she had listened from childhood to the stories of immigrants and Indian women.         An early milestone in her career was ''North Star Country'' (1945), the story of how Minnesota and Wisconsin were settled. It was reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press in 1984. Her recent work included ''The Dread Road'' (1991), a novel about a mining strike in Colorado.         She is survived by two daughters, Rachel Tilsen of Hudson and Deborah Le Sueur of Graton, Calif.; 8 grandchildren; 27 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Greer Lankton, an artist known for her flamboyant doll-like sculptures, was found dead in her apartment in Chicago last Monday. She was 38.         An autopsy will be held to determine the cause of death, said her father, William Lankton of Park Forest, Ill.         Ms. Lankton, who had a sex-change operation in 1979, was born in Flint, Mich., in 1958 and was originally named Greg Robert Lankton. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and received a bachelor's of fine arts from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1981.         Her sculptures evolved from the dolls she had made since childhood. Beautifully sewn, with extravagant clothes, make-up and hairstyles, they were at once glamorous and grotesque and exuded intense, Expressionistic personalities that reminded some observers of Egon Schiele. They presaged many of the concerns of 90's art, including the emphasis on the body, sexuality, fashion and, in their resemblance to puppets, performance. Sometimes Ms. Lankton created elaborate settings for her figures, heightening their theatricality.         During the 1980's Ms. Lankton was part of the East Village art scene in Manhattan. She had solo shows at Civilian Warfare, a gallery on Avenue B, in 1983, '84 and '85, and was also a frequent subject of the photographer Nan Goldin. She is featured in Ms. Goldin's 1995 film ''I'll Be Your Mirror.'' Ms. Lankton moved back to Chicago in 1987, living and working in a small studio apartment filled with her figures. Last month an installation largely recreating this room, opened at the Mattress Factory, an alternative space in Pittsburgh. In 1995, Ms. Lankton's work was represented in the Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Venice Biennale.         In addition to her father, Ms. Lankton is survived by her mother, Lynn, also of Park Forest; a brother, Mark Alan, of Saugatuck, Mich., and a sister, Cathy, of Bellingham, Wash.       
         Ruth Ratner Miller, a Cleveland business woman and civic leader, died on Tuesday at the Cleveland Clinic. She was 70 and a lifelong  resident of the city.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         At her death she was president of Tower City Center, part of a complex of buildings in downtown Cleveland. Topped by a 32-story structure, it contains office space, retail businesses, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and a multiscreen movie house.         Tower City was built by her family's Forest City Enterprises, a national real-estate developer. Its New York affiliate, the Forest City Ratner Companies, is involved in several projects in Brooklyn, including Metrotech and the new Atlantic Center shopping mall.         Mrs. Miller, a member of numerous civic and community groups, contributed to causes serving women's causes, Jewish philanthropies and the State of Israel. She was a board member of the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the National Jewish Coalition and a trustee of Cleveland State University and the Western Reserve Historical Society.         For her work in support of Israel Bonds she received its David Ben-Gurion Award in 1977. She received the American Jewish Committee's Human Relations Award and the Distinguished Community Service Award from Brandeis University.         She graduated from Case Western Reserve University, where she earned a Ph.D. in guidance and counseling, and lectured in educational psychology at Case Western from 1969 to 1974. That year she joined the administration of Mayor Ralph J. Perk as director of community development and, later, director of public health and welfare.         Mrs. Miller is survived by her second husband, Rabbi Philip Horowitz; three sons, Aaron Miller of Washington, Richard Miller of Boston and Abraham Miller of Cleveland; a daughter, Gabrielle Miller of Wellesley, Mass.; a brother, Albert B. Ratner, of Cleveland, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Louise Bates Ames, a psychologist whose pioneering work on children held that development unfolded in discrete, predictable stages, died last Thursday at her granddaughter's home in Cincinnati. She was 88 and lived in New Haven until shortly before her death.         The cause was cancer, said Jacqueline I. Haines, director of the Gesell Institute in New Haven, which Dr. Ames helped found in 1950.         Working in the 1930's and 40's with Frances L. Ilg and Arnold Gesell, and then later at the institute named in Dr. Gesell's honor, Dr. Ames developed the thesis that ages have patterned, predictable behavior. Thus, at about 2 1/2 years old, for example, children tend to become inflexible and rigid; the result is the ''terrible 2's,'' a term they helped popularize.         The idea that children develop in stages and that parents and doctors should pay attention to them was quite important in its time, said Dr. Sidney M. Baker, who headed the institute from 1978 to 1985. ''Now we know about these things, and it doesn't seem so surprising,'' he said.         But the work was later criticized as being too inflexible and too tied to the idea that a child's development is set in stone by genetics. ''People would talk about Gesell testing as if they were saying all 4-year-olds should be the same,'' Dr. Baker said.         In reality, the researchers thought just the opposite; they used their testing and research techniques ''as a measure of individuality, not conformity,'' he said.         Dr. Ames's greatest impact, Dr. Baker said, was in educating parents and teachers about the rhythms of child development. She was a prolific writer, and her work included a syndicated newspaper column with Dr. Ilg and co-authorship of several best-selling books; among them, ''Child Behavior'' (published in 1981 and reissued by Harper Perennial in 1992) is still popular. She also developed several television series on child development, including one in the early days of television, in 1952.         Louise Bates was born in Portland, Me., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Maine. In 1933, she joined the  Yale Clinic of Child Development, working as Dr. Gesell's research assistant. She received her Ph.D. from Yale in 1937, studying how infants make the transition to crawling, or ''prone procession.''         When Dr. Gesell retired in 1948, the direction of the clinic changed toward a more psychoanalytic view of child development, Dr. Haines said. Dr. Ames and Dr. Ilg moved up the hill from the campus and founded the Gesell Institute, unaffiliated with the university, to continue their research.         That research consisted largely of filming children as they played or did certain tasks. Dr. Ames and the others compiled hundreds of hours of films, later studying them in minute detail.         It was cinema of a different sort that caused trouble for Dr. Ames in the mid-1980's, when she was criticized for suggesting in a newspaper interview that parents should not take young children to see the Disney film ''Bambi,'' in which the young deer's mother is killed by hunters.         ''I think this is one of any child's greatest fears, that something will happen to his mother,'' Dr. Ames said in a later interview, defending her position. She recommended that any parent who felt compelled to take a child under age 5 to see the movie should read the book to the child first, to gauge the reaction. ''And I would then wait a few days,'' she advised, ''because sometimes a child cries uncontrollably at the time, and sometimes they seem to stand something O.K. and then they start having nightmares.''         Dr. Ames's marriage to Smith Ames, a medical doctor, in the 1930's ended in divorce.         In addition to her granddaughter, Carol Haber, she is survived by a brother, Silas Bates of Philadelphia; a grandson, Clifford Chase, who lives in Ohio, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Mara Palmer, an interior decorator who worked on yachts and offices as well as private homes in the United States and Europe, died on Nov. 20 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Among Mrs. Palmer's assignments were the Restaurant Daniel on East 76th Street, a French restaurant that opened three years ago, and the Upper East Side apartment of James Berry Hill, owner of Berry-Hill Galleries, whose home was featured in Architectural Digest in 1992.         Mrs. Palmer is survived by a brother, Angel Srebrov of Lucerne, Switzerland; a stepdaughter, Audrey Palmer Neville of Los Angeles; a stepson, Michael Palmer of London, and four granddaughters. Her husband, Paul Palmer, died in 1983.       
         Nancy Macdonald, the well-born anarchist who helped radicalize her husband, Dwight Macdonald, in the 1930's, managed his magazine Politics in the 1940's, and then struck out on her own in the 1950's to aid refugees of the Spanish civil war, died last Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 86 and had lived on East 10th Street for more than half a century.         Her son Nicholas said the cause was emphysema.         The darlings of New York's radicals in the 1930's were the half million Spanish loyalists who fought in vain against the forces of Francisco Franco, then made their way across the Pyrenees to refuge in southwestern France.         The loyalists got a lot of attention at the beginning, and those who had been Communists continued to receive support, but by the 1950's, with Franco's fascist dictatorship well established, the others had become what Mrs. Macdonald called ''the legion of the forgotten,'' languishing in poverty, unable and unwilling to return to their homeland.         It was then that Mrs. Macdonald decided to remind the world of their plight. In 1953 she founded Spanish Refugee Aid to provide help to the non-Communist exiles.         From her office on Union Square, Mrs. Macdonald attracted money and support from intellectual friends like Hannah Arendt, James T. Farrell, Alfred Kazin and Barbara Tuchman, while Pablo Casals and Francine Faure, the wife of Albert Camus, distributed the aid in France.         And her home, which had been a literary and political social center in the 1930's, was hopping once again. Where T. S. Eliot had once been among the lionized guests, Alexander Calder mingled with refugees.         There was, to be sure, one change on East 10th Street. Mr. Macdonald, who had helped establish the aid organization, was no longer around as the marriage had dissolved.         On paper, at least, the union between Dwight Macdonald and Nancy Gardiner Rodman seemed made in establishment heaven. He was Yale, she was Vassar, and both were descended from prominent families, he from the Dwights of old New England, she from the Gardiners of colonial New York.         When her brother, Selden Rodman, a poet and prominent art collector, introduced them at a party, she, the daughter of a New York architect, was fresh out of college, and he was a writer for Fortune magazine.         For all their social and establishment credentials, both had left-wing views. In his years as a founding editor of Partisan Review in the 1930's, as the founder of Politics in the 1940's and later as a social critic for The New Yorker, Mr. Macdonald acknowledged that his wife had prodded him ever leftward.         It was also her family money that enabled him to leave Fortune for The Partisan Review, where she worked as business manager. And it was her administrative skills as managing editor that helped keep Politics going  after the couple established it in their apartment in 1943.         While her husband was securing his reputation as a major critic, Mrs. Macdonald was becoming known for her intellectual fervor and for what Mr. Kazin recalled as her abiding kindness and concern for others.         Mrs. Macdonald, who peppered The New York Times and other publications with letters and articles describing the plight of the refugees, even after the death of Franco in 1974, continued to direct Spanish Refugee Aid until retiring in 1983, then summed up her work with a book in 1987 based on taped interviews, ''Homage to the Spanish Exiles: Voices from the Spanish Civil War.''         With the time and the restoration of democracy in Spain, the number of exiles has declined, but there are still 125 aging loyalists receiving help from the charity. According to the director, Margaret Childress, because of Mrs. Macdonald's financial efforts, the help will continue.         Mr. Macdonald died in 1982. In addition to her son Nicholas, of Brooklyn, and her brother of Oakland, N.J., Mrs. Macdonald is survived by another son, Michael of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great grandchild.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Monday about Nancy Macdonald, who aided refugees of the Spanish Civil War, misstated the year of Francisco Franco's death. It was 1975, not 1974.       
         Mary Cooper Jewett Gaiser, a philanthropist who served on the boards of nonprofit institutions in the fields of education, community service and the arts, died on Sunday at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane, Wash. She was 95 and lived in Spokane.         Over the years, Mrs. Gaiser (pronounced like ''geyser'') served on the boards of numerous institutions that were beneficiaries of her largess. She was a trustee of Wellesley College, of which she was an alumna, for 18 years. She was active in fund-raising for Wellesley, and its Jewett Art Center is named for her first husband, George Frederick Jewett, who died in 1956. He was chairman and president of Potlatch Forests, a forest-products concern based in Lewiston, Idaho. .         Her philanthropy extended to other educational institutions, including the American University of Beirut, Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif., all of which she served as a trustee. Mrs. Gaiser had been on the national board of the Young Women's Christian Association since the late 1940's. ''Women are wonderful,'' she once declared. ''Like tea bags, they never know their strength until they get into hot water.''         She was president of the Spokane Y.W.C.A. during World War II, and oversaw programs to help women and children with problems related to the war. In addition, she was on the boards of the Spokane Arts Commission, which she helped set up, and of what is now the Spokane Symphony orchestra, in whose founding she was instrumental. In 1987, after donating $225,000 to the orchestra's endowment, she said: ''Half the fun of life is sharing. People are missing a lot of satisfaction if they don't get pleasure from using their abilities to help others.''         She and Mr. Jewett also played an important role in the construction of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Spokane.         A doctor's daughter, Mrs. Gaiser was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1923, and taught school in Bronxville, N.Y. until she married Mr. Jewett in 1925. They lived in communities in Idaho until they moved to Spokane in 1937. She married Dr. David Wesley Gaiser, a surgeon, in 1961, and he died in 1985.         Mrs. Gaiser is survived by a son, George Frederick Jewett Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter, Margaret Jewett Greer of Chevy Chase, Md.; six grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; a sister, Janet Cooper Dakin of Irvington, Va., and a brother, Dr. William Grant Cooper Jr., of Little Rock, Ark.       
         Peggy Wattles Pulleyn, whose grandchild's ill fortune moved her to found the Princeton Child Development Institute in 1970, died on Dec. 8 in a freakish accident near her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 85.         According to the Somerset County Prosecutor's office, she was walking on a road in Bedminster when a car driven by a longtime friend, Allison Ewing, backing up to meet her, lurched out of control and struck her. No charges were filed against Mrs. Ewing, 76, who is the wife of New Jersey's senior State Senator, John H. Ewing of Bernardsville.         The institute in Princeton, now caring for about 40 autistic children, has grown into a nationally recognized center that has served as a model elsewhere in the country. Its science-based program, backed by research and staff training, was recognized by the Federal Government in 1983 when it cited the Institute as one of 60 exemplary private schools in the country.         Mrs. Pulleyn felt the need for such a school in 1968 when her family realized that her first grandson, Rollie, was autistic, a still-enigmatic condition with many associated disorders. Her search for a suitable program for the child led her, her daughter and some other parents in the Princeton region to start their own school.         From modest beginnings with 17 children, the institute moved into its own home in Princeton, where a further addition was completed this year. Mrs. Pulleyn was an original board member.         She served as its longtime chairwoman, raising funds for the state-supported institute. Up to her death, she remained active on the board, and was also active in another project: the Magic Shop in Oldwick.         Founded just after World War II, it is a gift shop that initially assisted returning veterans. Since then, it has been a financial supporter of the nearby Bonnie Brae Home for Boys, a boarding institution that teaches troubled children academic subjects and trade skills.         Mrs. Pulleyn, an amateur artist, contributed her work and staffed the counter to sell the Magic Shop's wide variety of children's clothing and other handmade materials. The day before her death, she suited up the shop's Santa for the season.         Peggy Wattles grew up in Buffalo and graduated from Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y. She was an outstanding amateur golfer who won New York State championships in the 1930's and twice reached the quarterfinals of the United States Women's National Golf Tournament.         Mrs. Pulleyn's husband, Robert, a lawyer, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Pamela Pulleyn Machold of Princeton; a brother, Gurdon W. Wattles of Oldwick; a sister, Elizabeth Wattles of Hightstown, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Eileen R. Donovan, the United States Ambassador to Barbados from 1969 to 1974, died on Thursday in Spring Hill, Fla. She was 81 and had lived in Clearwater, Fla.         Her brother, William L. Donovan, said that the cause was cardio-respiratory arrest and that she had suffered from chronic respiratory obstructive disease.         Miss Donovan was a consul in Barbados in 1960, and in 1962 became consul general.         From 1965 to 1969, she served as assistant director of the State Department's Office of Carribean Affairs before returning to Barbados as Ambassador, becoming the highest ranking woman in the Foreign Service.         Miss Donovan began her career in the Foreign Service in 1948, serving in the Philippines, Italy and Japan, where she was a political liaison officer. In the late 1950's she became  chief of the Southern Europe branch of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research.         Miss Donovan was a native of Boston, where she earned a bachelor's degree from Boston Teachers College in 1936 and a master's degree in education in 1937. She later received a master's of public administration degree from Harvard.         Miss Donovan was a history teacher in the Boston public school system from 1938 to 1943, and then served in the Women's Army Corps during World War II, where she quickly rose from private to captain.         In 1945, she was the primary assistant to Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the Tokyo headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. She worked in the field of Japanese women's education.         She is survived by her brother, of Scituate, Mass.       
         Anne Schwerner, a retired New York teacher and the mother of Michael H. Schwerner, a 24-year-old civil-rights worker killed by Ku Klux Klansmen near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964, died on Friday at a nursing home in Kettering, Ohio. A former resident of Pelham, N.Y., she was 84.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Born Anne Seigel in the Bronx, she graduated from Hunter College in biology, earned a master's degree in education at Queens College and started a teaching career in the city's public schools. She then taught at New Rochelle High School for 20 years until her retirement in 1976.         After their son's death, she and her husband, Nathan, helped raise money for groups like the Congress on Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and lobbied for Federal voting-rights legislation.         Mrs. Schwerner is survived by another son, Stephen of Yellow Springs, Ohio; her brother, Morris Seigel, a resident of Florida, and two granddaughters. Nathan Schwerner, a retired wig manufacturer, died in 1991.       
         Patricia Johnson Deely, a retired New York social worker and psychotherapist who helped build one of the city's agencies for drug addicts and others needing social services, died on Dec. 15 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 73 and lived on the Upper East Side and in Stockbridge, Mass.         The cause was cancer, Mary D. Kierstead, a family friend, said.         Mrs. Deely, who practiced psychotherapy in Manhattan until a few years ago, was a founding sponsor of the Lower East Side Service Center in 1959. At the time, she was working with adolescent addicts at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, now Roosevelt Island.         She was the center's president for 10 years in the 1960's and 70's. At times, the board met in her home, and she remained active serving the center until her illness worsened.         Although the center kept its original name, it has grown into a citywide service treating some 2,500 a year as outpatients and residents.         Mrs. Deely, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Adelphi University and received a master's degree from the Hunter College School of Social Work. She also served on charitable boards benefiting children, including the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service, as well as the Norman Rockwell Museum and the Berkshire Botanical Garden.         She is survived by her husband of nearly 50 years, James Sedgwick Deely, and two daughters, Catharine D. Stansfield of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Pamela Van de Loo of Loudonville, N.Y.       
         Zoya Leporska, a dancer and choreographer and a founder of Dancers Over 40, died on Dec. 16 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a short illness, said Barbara Meiste, a friend.         Ms. Leporska was born in Siberia and raised in China. She began her dance training in Seattle. Her teachers included George Balanchine, Adolph Bolm and Charles Weidman.         She performed with the San Francisco Opera Ballet and the Eugene Loring Players, but she was best known as a dancer and choreographer on Broadway. She was Bob Fosse's assistant on ''The Pajama Game,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''New Girl in Town,'' and was the dance captain for seven Broadway shows.         Ms. Leporska also worked with Hal Prince, Shirley MacLaine and Gwen Verdon on revues and helped set dance sequences for productions by Frank Corsaro at the New York City Opera, where she appeared as Mrs. Winemiller in ''Summer and Smoke.'' Ms. Leporska's ''Looking for Talent'' was performed by Dancers Over 40 in September at Dance Theater Workshop.         She is survived by a brother, Walter Leporsky of Santa Rosa, Calif.       
         Magda Denes, a psychoanalyst who had just completed a book recounting her torment as a Jewish child hunted by the Nazis in wartime Budapest, was found dead on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         She apparently had suffered a heart attack or stroke, her family said yesterday through a friend, Geoffrey Weill.         Dr. Denes's second book, ''Castles Burning: A Child's Life in War,'' is to be published in January by W. W. Norton. A book party was set for Jan. 9, after which Dr. Denes was to give readings and interviews around the United States and abroad. Rights to the book, which was selected as a Literary Guild featured alternate, were also recently sold for German, British and Dutch publication.         The book recounts Dr. Denes's ordeal as one of the so-called hidden children, estimated to number from 10,000 to 100,000, who spent World War II in stables and caves and secret rooms like Anne Frank's annex in Amsterdam. Young Madga was 5 in 1939 when her father, Gyula Denes, a wealthy publisher, fled Budapest, abandoning his daughter, son and wife, who sought refuge in houses protected by Swiss diplomats.         For five months in 1944, she and her family lived in a basement, and on occasion, she wrote, she hid in a filthy bathroom and an oven.         In despair, she and her family once debated whether to commit suicide or continue to hide. Magda, then 9, cast the deciding vote for survival.         In December 1944, months before liberation by Soviet forces, her 16-year-old brother, Ivan, who had been a secret courier for the Zionist resistance group Hashomer, was caught and shot. After the war, she and her mother, grandmother and aunt fled  to France and then to Cuba before immigrating to the United States.         She was 12 before she re-encountered her father, who pronounced her a rather unpleasant child. ''I know,'' she said she replied. ''Starving for prolonged periods of time while simultaneously being fed on by packs of lice tends to corrode one's pleasanter side.''         In New York City, Ms. Denes attended City College, and she did postgraduate study in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at Boston, Yeshiva and New York Universities. Since 1961 she had trained psychologists and psychiatrists.         At her death she was a participant in postdoctoral programs at Adelphi and New York universities. She was also a faculty member and supervisor in the psychiatry department at Mount Sinai Medical Center's School of Medicine and chairwoman of the New York State Psychological Association's Committee on Public Information.         In 1976, Dr. Denes published her first book, ''In Necessity and Sorrow: Life and Death in an Abortion Hospital,'' which a reviewer for The New York Times Book review called ''a highly emotional anti-abortion tract.'' Many other critics praised the book, and it was published in Austria, England, Germany and Japan.         Dr. Denes is survived by her mother, Margit, and two sons, Gregory Radomisli and Timothy Radomisli, both of New York City.         Interviewed along with with other childhood survivors of the Nazis in 1991, Dr. Denes said she had long struggled to break her silence. ''The hidden children are in a curious position,'' she said. ''They were not deported and they were not killed. So they never felt entitled to talk about their own experiences.         ''Holocaust survivors tend to be totally absorbed with that experience, while hidden children have tried to forget what happened to them.''       
         Anita Diamant Berke, a literary agent who nurtured the career of V. C. Andrews, the best-selling novelist, died on Saturday at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 78.         The cause was a heart attack, relatives said.         Anita Diamant, as she was known in her professional life, created the Anita Diamant Literary Agency in 1971 after working in various magazine posts. The agency now represents about 125 writers.         In 1976, Ms. Diamant got a letter from a Norfolk, Va., woman who wanted to be a writer. The woman, V. C. Andrews, soon sent along a manuscript, which Ms. Diamant liked and sold to the Pocket Books division of Simon & Schuster. The book, "Flowers in the Attic," has sold millions of copies worldwide and led to Ms. Andrews's fame.         Ms. Diamant was a longtime member of the Overseas Press Club and was its first woman president, from 1981 to 1986.         Her husband, Harold B. Berke, died in 1972. Surviving are a daughter, Allyson Forsythe; a brother, David Diamant, and two grandchildren, all of Weston.       
         Elizabeth Clementine Miller Tangeman, a philanthropist and matriarch of a leading Indiana industrial family, died on Wednesday at her home in Columbus, Ind. She was 90.         At her death she was chairwoman of the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation of Columbus, a major regional donor to the arts, Christian education, social services, child welfare and community development. A family foundation, it reported grants of more than $1.65 million in the 1992 fiscal year.         In 1919, the Miller family founded the Cummins Engine Company of Columbus, which grew into the world's largest independent maker of diesel engines, with annual revenue of more than $4 billion and a payroll of more than 23,000. The company earned a national reputation for corporate good works, including paying  for renowned architects to design public buildings for Columbus, leading the town to style itself "the Athens of the prairie."         Born in Columbus, Mrs. Tangeman graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1927. She served as a trustee of Butler University, the Christian Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary.         She had a lifelong interest in Scouting and was a past director of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and a trustee of the World Foundation for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. Her dedication to music led her to help establish the Institute of  Sacred Music at Yale University in 1973.         Mrs. Tangeman is survived by a stepson, John T. Tangeman of Kansas City, Mo.; a brother, J. Irwin Miller, the former chairman of Cummins Engine, and a stepgranddaughter. Her husband, Prof. Robert S. Tangeman, died in 1964.       
         Felice N. Schwartz, who was active for more than three decades in the advancement of women in the workplace, and whose writing focused debate over the career model known as the "mommy track," died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She died of heart failure after a long illness, said her son Tony.         Mrs. Schwartz was the founder of Catalyst, a national organization that was  dedicated to helping women choose and advance careers and that later promoted the participation of women in corporations and their recruitment on corporate boards. She remained its president for 30 years, retiring in 1993.         She prompted a national debate in 1989 with an article in the Harvard Business Review that asserted it cost companies more to employ women than men. She noted that women's careers were often interrupted, or ended, when they had children and suggested that employers create policies to help mothers balance career and family responsibilities by giving them more flexibility in work hours and providing high-quality day care.         An uproar began almost immediately. Her proposed alternative career track came to be called the "mommy track." Detractors voiced the fear that by raising  the higher cost issue, women would not be hired and promoted and that all women  would be left with the primary responsibility for child care. Mrs. Schwartz said her views were widely misinterpreted.         "I violated the politically correct thing by saying that women are not just like men, " Mrs. Schwartz maintained in an interview in The Boston Globe in 1992. "What I said then and still say is that women face many, many obstacles in the workplace that men do not face. I was saying to that group of men at the top, 'Rather than let women's talents go to waste, do something about it.' "         She believed, she said, that there should be a parent track. "When a woman is faced with doing all the housework, all the child care and then full-time work in the corporate area, she is stunted. The same applies to men."         The daughter of Albert and Rose Nierenberg of New York, she first became involved in social causes while an undergraduate at Smith College. In 1945, she  founded the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students. The organization lobbied colleges and universities to open their doors to minorities and provided financial aid for college bound African-American students.         Catalyst, founded in 1962 after Mrs. Schwartz had spent a decade at home raising her children, focused in its early years on lobbying employers to allow  women to combine family and part-time work. The organization pioneered several job-sharing pilot projects in which two women shared a full-time job. It also undertook studies on family issues in the workplace.         In 1968, Mrs. Schwartz wrote "How to Go to Work When Your Husband Is Against  It, Your Children Aren't Old Enough and There's Nothing You Can Do Anyhow." A second book, "Breaking With Tradition: Women and Work, the New Facts of Life," was published in 1992. Last month, she finished writing "The Armchair Activist:  Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right." It will be published this  fall.         She was married in 1946 to Irving L. Schwartz, a scientist, educator and physician.         During the early years of her marriage, Mrs. Schwartz and her husband had what might have been one of the early commuter marriages. The family moved to Cincinnati where Dr. Schwartz had been offered a post at a medical school. Mrs.  Schwartz, who was planning the organization that later became Catalyst, believed that it had to be launched in New York. She returned with her three children and Dr. Schwartz spent the next two years flying back and forth on weekends.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Cassie Arnold of Washington; two  sons, Tony Schwartz of New York City and James Schwartz of Boston; a brother, Theodore Nierenberg of Armonk, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.       
         Elizabeth McCall Cain, a figure in Manhattan's social world who was active in arranging benefits for educational and cultural institutions, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, her brother, Julien L. McCall, said.         Mrs. Cain was on numerous charitable committees, including the Institute of  International Education and the New York Public Library.         She attended Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C., and in 1944, married Arthur A. Houghton Jr., the chairman of Steuben Glass. They divorced in 1972. Two years later, she married Walker O. Cain, an architect.         She is survived by a daughter, Hollister Douglas Houghton of Boca Grande, Fla.; two brothers, Arthur C. McCall of Greenville, S.C., and Julien McCall of Hunting Valley, Ohio. Mr. Houghton died in 1990 and Mr. Cain in 1993.       
         Ann Barry, who pursued a freelance writing career while working as an editor  at The New York Times and at The New Yorker, died of cancer on Saturday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 53 and lived in Brooklyn.         Miss Barry, who was born in St. Louis and graduated from St. Louis University, started as an editorial assistant at the The New Yorker in 1967 before moving down the street to The Times in 1975.         While designing and editing the Sunday Arts and Leisure Guide, editing art and dance reviews and designing the daily cultural pages, she began contributing articles to The Times, a career she continued and expanded after she returned to The New Yorker in 1990 as managing editor of the Goings On About Town section.         Although she wrote on a variety of subjects, Miss Barry, who left The New Yorker in 1994, particularly enjoyed writing about the Dordogne region of southwestern France, where, not coincidentally, she owned a vacation home.         Although she could spend only two or three weeks there a year, Miss Barry kept such meticulous track of her intense short-term experiences that she turned them into a book, "At Home in France: Tales of an American and Her House Abroad." It is being published by Ballantine next month.         She is survived by a brother, Gene, of Palm Harbor, Fla.
