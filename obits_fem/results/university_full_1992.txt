         Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She worked with AIDS organizations and talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission.         Mrs. Chow, known professionally as Tina Chow, began her career at the age of 16, modeling for Shiseido, a leading cosmetics company in Japan. Soon she found herself working at fashion shows and for photographers, appearing on major magazine covers and in pictures for advertisements and fashion news articles. She was a favorite model of Cecil Beaton, among other photographers.         In the early 1970's, she married Michael Chow and worked with him in running his Mr. Chow restaurant in London, a fashionable restaurant featuring Peking cuisine. Later they moved to Manhattan, opening a branch of the restaurant on 57th Street, and then to California to create a third branch in Beverly Hills. Crystals on Cords         She began designing jewelry in the mid-1980's and was a trendsetter for her use of quartz and other crystals as amulets and rings in a variety of settings and as pendants on silk cords. She had outlets in leading stores in several cities, including in Manhattan at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue and at the Ted Muehling Shop in SoHo.         More recently she had shifted into abstract and organic sculpture in crystal and furniture design.         Regularly listed as one of the best-dressed women, she acquired a large collection of designer clothes and patterns, part of which is to be shown at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan starting March 16. Rizzoli Publishing is working on a book on the collection.         She remained professionally active while fighting her illness and worked with Angel Food, an organization that delivers food to AIDS patients.         Mrs. Chow was born in Lakeview, Ohio. As a teen-ager she moved with her family to Tokyo, where her father, Walter Edmund Lutz, worked in international trade. Mrs. Chow was educated at Sophia University in Tokyo.

She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She had talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission, and even before she knew she would be stricken, she was active in AIDS organizations because of the epidemic's toll on colleagues and friends.

         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.         She moved to New York to be a school librarian in Scarsdale from 1939 to 1942. She was a librarian and professor of library service at New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton from 1942-54, with a two-year leave as a visiting professor at the University of Teheran and library adviser to Iran. She also taught at the University of Virginia and Emory University.         After her retirement from Rutgers, she served as a library consultant and later vice president of Bro-Dart Inc., a wholesale book supplier. She wrote and edited numerous articles and books on libraries.         Her survivors include a sister, Lydia Harvey, also of Danville.       
         Wanda Mary Jablonski, an expert on the international oil industry and founder of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly newsletter, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said Edward L. Morse, the newsletter's publisher.         Ms. Jablonski's career began when she landed a big story in 1945 while still an office messenger at the Journal of Commerce in Manhattan. Filling in for the oil reporter and assigned to cover a news conference conducted by a Venezuelan official, she waited until the session ended to corner him for a private interview. In the interview, he disclosed plans to seize and nationalize all foreign oil operations in Venezuela. He also called for joint action by developing countries with oil reserves, an idea that culminated in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960. Savoir-Faire Was Helpful         Ms. Jablonski became the Journal's oil editor and "the most influentual oil journalist of her time," as Daniel Yergin wrote in his history of the oil business, "The Prize" (Simon & Schuster, 1990). He added that she had the "savoir-faire required to get her through all sorts of situations."         Making her way in a male-dominated industry, she befriended Texas wildcatters, Arab sheiks, corporate executives and important government figures around the globe. She traveled often, once spending six months in the desert; on a visit to Saudi Arabia, she found herself housed in the guest quarters of the king's harem.         McGraw-Hill hired her in 1954 as senior editor of its new Petroleum Week, but the magazine folded in 1961. Jobless, she founded her own weekly, which was 8 to 12 pages and printed on yellow paper. It grew steadily to a circulation in the thousands, despite an annual subscription fee in the hundreds of dollars. The current price is $1,375.         Her newsletter became required reading in the industry for information on explorations, refining, supplies, prices and political trends. The readership ranged from Central Intelligence Agency officials to Middle East rulers. Her early reports on oil company plans occasionally enraged executives, who sometimes temporarily canceled their subscriptions in protest. She sold the weekly in 1988 to the Petroleum Intelligence Group. Born in Czechoslovakia         Ms. Jablonski was born in Czechoslovakia. Her mother was a physicist; her father, Eugene, worked for the Socony Oil Company, and the family followed him around the world to England, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Texas, Europe and Morocco.         After settling in the United States in 1938, Ms. Jablonski earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1942 and a master's in journalism from Columbia University in 1943.         In recent years she worked for the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in Manhattan as the director of the National High-Risk Registry for women with a family history of breast cancer. She donated $3 million to the center.         She was married and divorced three times. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.         Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.         She had been in the Navy, as an active-duty officer or a reservist, since World War II, and received a special Presidential appointment to the rank of rear admiral in 1983. In 1982, with the retirement of Adm. Hyman J. Rickover, Admiral Hopper became the oldest officer on active duty in the armed service, which she remained until retiring herself in 1986.         Admiral Hopper made several vital contributions to the development of modern computing systems, including helping invent the Cobol programming language, which is still in widespread use in business.  Award from President         In September, President George Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology "for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users." She was the first woman to receive the award individually.         At the time of her death she was a senior consultant to the Digital Equipment Corporation. She joined Digital in 1986, shortly after her retirement from the Navy.         "Grace took every opportunity to challenge people young and old to consider the infinite possibilities of technology," said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital Equipment's president.         Admiral Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on Dec. 9, 1906, in New York City. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale, she taught math at Vassar College, her alma mater, where she later became an associate professor. She was divorced in 1945 but kept her married name.         In 1949 she worked as a mathematician at the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation. The company was formed by Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in 1946 had developed one of the world's first electronic computers, ENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. Eckert-Mauchly was then building the Univac I, the first commercial electronic computer. The company was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation.         Earlier, in 1943, Dr. Hopper had joined the Navy. As a lieutenant assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, she worked as a programmer on a calculating device called the Mark I, a precursor electronic computers.  Recalled by the Navy         Leaving the Navy in 1946, she remained at Harvard as a faculty member in the computation laboratory. She continued to work on early Navy computers and maintained her Naval career as a reservist. Although retired from the Navy reserve in 1966, then-Commander Hopper was recalled within a year to active duty to oversee a program to standardize the Navy's computer programs and languages.         In 1962, she was elected a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association selected her as its first computer sciences "Man of the Year."         Her work led to the first practical compiler for modern computers. A compiler is a program that translates instructions written by a human programmer into more specific codes that can be directly read by a computer.         Among her many contributions, Admiral Hopper is known for coining the term "bug," which is widely used to refer to mysterious computer failures.         The first bug actually was -- a moth, as Admiral Hopper told the story. It was discovered one August night at Harvard in 1945 inside the Mark I.         "Things were going badly, there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long, glass-enclosed computer," she is quoted as saying. "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth. From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."         Like another Navy figure, Admiral Rickover, Admiral Hopper was known for her combative personality and her unorthodox approach.         A self-described "boat rocker," she once said in a speech that she hoped to live until the year 2000. "I have two reasons," she said. "The first is that the party on Dec. 31, 1999, will be a New Year's Eve party to end all New Year's Eve parties. The second is that I want to point back to the early days of computers and say to all the doubters, 'See? We told you the computer could do all that.' "         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Roger F. Murray II of New Hampshire, and a sister, Mary Murray Westcote of New Jersey.       
         Dame Judith Anderson, who electrified Broadway audiences in 1947 with her savage performance of the title role in "Medea" and was a memorably sinister housekeeper in the 1940 film "Rebecca," died yesterday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Dame Judith, who was born in Australia, was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960 for "distinguished contributions to the stage." For years she was one of the first ladies of the American theater, repeatedly portraying women gripped by powerful emotions.         After the Broadway premiere of the 1947 "Medea" -- a new adaptation of Euripides's drama, written for Dame Judith by the poet Robinson Jeffers -- Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that she had "set a landmark in the theater" with her "inspired performance of rage and revenge."         Her fiery portrait of a barbarian woman who takes revenge on Jason, the unfaithful father of her two sons, by murdering them won the actress an honored niche in theater history. Many Notable Roles         Among the actress's other notable stage roles were Lavinia Mannon in Eugene O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra" (1932), Delia in Zoe Atkins's "Old Maid" (1935) and Gertrude in "Hamlet" (1936).         She was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her portrayal of the malevolent housekeeper Mrs. Danvers in "Rebecca," a Gothic romance directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier.         She displayed her versatility in a wide range of movie roles, among them the biblical Queen Herodias in "Salome" (1953) and an Indian woman named Buffalo Cow Head in "A Man Called Horse" (1970).         Dame Judith's television successes included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth in 1960 in an NBC-TV "Hallmark Hall of Fame" production. Born to Be Evil         Early in her career, in a 1924 issue of Theater Magazine, Dame Judith wrote, "I like emotional roles because they permit unleashing of one's feelings."         She gave full rein to those feelings in "Medea," a role she seemed to have been born to play. The Broadway production ran for 214 performances and went on an eight-month tour coast to coast. In 1949, she played the part again in New York City in the Jeffers adaptation, this time at City Center, in a production presented and staged by Guthrie McClintic. She performed in the play again in later years, venturing as far as Paris, Berlin and Canberra, Australia.         As time passed, she came to take a broad view of the actor's craft. "We live, we breathe, we experience, we die, we love, we hate, we experience beauty and tragedy, and we find it in the parts we play," she said in a 1984 interview, adding, "Whatever I do, I'm passionate about."         Dame Judith first appeared onstage in 1915 in Sydney, Australia. She made her New York stage debut in 1918 and went on to spend much of her life in the United States.         When she appeared in a 1936 production of "Hamlet" at the Empire Theater, Brooks Atkinson wrote that in her performance as Hamlet's mother, the queen, she had "abandoned the matronly stuffiness that usually plagues that part and given us a woman of strong and bewildered feeling." She went on to play Lady Macbeth in London in 1937.         In 1971 she realized a long-held dream by playing Hamlet in a production staged at Carnegie Hall, but her performance was not well received. Resonance of Tradition         Reviewing the 1982 revival of "Medea," in which she played the nurse who tries in vain to thwart Medea's murderous intentions, Frank Rich wrote in The Times that Dame Judith's presence "gives this 'Medea' the valuable resonance of theatrical tradition" and praised her acting as harrowing. The production was broadcast on public television the next year.         She went on to play a grand dame on an NBC-TV daytime drama, "Santa Barbara," which made its debut in 1984. Her first line, spoken to her chauffeur, was "Ambrose, why have we stopped?" Then she tapped him with a riding crop. A Namesake Off Broadway         The woman who chose to be known professionally as Judith Anderson was named Frances Margaret when she was born on Feb. 10, 1899, to James Anderson-Anderson and the former Jessie Saltmarsh. After attending Australian schools, she made her 1915 stage debut in "A Royal Divorce" at the Theater Royal in Sydney.         Seven decades later in New York City, the former Lion Theater on West 42d Street was renamed the Judith Anderson Theater in her honor. Speaking at a ceremony there, she looked back on what she called "my failures and my successes, my tears and my laughter, my joys and my sorrows, my heartbreaks and my loves, and my pride and my gratitude for the wonderful audiences that have played their music for me to listen to."         Dame Judith's 1937 marriage to Benjamin Harrison Lehman, a professor of English at the University of California at Berkeley, ended in divorce in 1939. Her 1946 marriage to Luther Greene, a theatrical producer, ended in divorce in 1950.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Shirley Jenkins, a noted social work researcher, author and educator, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Jenkins wrote 10 books and was the founding director of the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice. The center is co-sponsored by Columbia University's School of Social Work and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. It seeks to integrate academic theory and clinical practice.         She taught at Columbia for 25 years until her retirement two years ago. She was chairwoman of Columbia's Advisory Committee for Ethnic Studies and served on its Commission on the Future of the University, the University Senate and the Faculty Executive Committee. Served on Several Panels         She was director of research training in social work and mental health for the National Institutes of Health from 1977 to 1988. She was also a member of the United States Department of Health and Human Services's expert panel, the New York State Advisory Committee on Refugee Mental Health and the New York City Task Force on Minorities in Child Care.         Among the issues she studied for government and private agencies were cultural factors in providing social services to new immigrants, family welfare programs, foster care, Social Security and the shortchanging of minorities and the poor in the allocation of park and recreation services.         Born Shirley Presberg in New York City, she earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College, a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from New York University.         Early in her career she focused on international affairs. From 1944 to 1948 she was the associate editor of Far Eastern Survey, a journal. From 1948 to 1950 she was a political officer for the United Nations Department of Security Council Affairs. She also wrote "American Economic Policy Toward the Philippines" (Stanford University, 1954).         Her husband, David, died in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Peter, of Queens and Ian of Manahttan, and three grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Shurr, who performed in the 1920's and 30's with such pioneering American modern dance companies as Denishawn, the Humphrey-Weidman Concert Company and the early Martha Graham company, died on Thursday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 88 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Dr. Rachael Yocom, a friend.         Born in Riga, Latvia, Miss Shurr came to the United States as a child. Her first professional fee, as she later described it, was a penny she earned dancing in the streets with an organ grinder whose music she liked. She began her formal dance training at the Denishawn school of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn and also studied with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Martha Graham. Taught Notable Figures         She danced with the Denishawn company from 1925 to 1927, leaving to join the earliest Humphrey-Weidman company, with which she danced from 1927 to 1929. She left to teach at the Graham school, corralling students at other studios for Miss Graham's first classes for adults. Miss Shurr joined the Graham company in 1930, dancing in many Graham classics in her eight years there. Among them was "Primitive Mysteries," which she helped Miss Graham revive in 1982.         Miss Shurr left the Graham troupe to perform with May O'Donnell, another company member, with whom she opened a dance studio in New York City; students there included Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, who later founded the Joffrey Ballet. In the early 1940's she received bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education, specializing in dance, from San Francisco State College and the University of Oregon, respectively.         Miss Shurr taught at the High School of Performing Arts in New York for more than two decades, serving as chairman of the dance department for three years. A tiny woman with a robust sense of humor, she established a reputation as a tough but loyal and influential teacher. Her students included the entertainers Ben Vereen and Liza Minnelli. She also was assistant choreographer for the Broadway musicals "Sadie Thompson" (1944) and "Top Banana" (1951).         Miss Shurr retired in 1971 but continued to work sporadically as a rehearsal coach. She was a dance adviser for the Arizona Commission on the Arts and directed the University of Utah's Opportunity Theater and Dance Workshop, a summer program. Last year she was named an Arizona Dance Treasure by the Arizona Dance Arts Alliance.         She is survived by her brother, George, of Manhattan.       
         Mercedes (Chiquita) Gregory, a documentary film maker and an influential figure in experimental theater, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 56 years old and lived in Santa Ynez, Calif.         She had breast cancer for three years, said her husband, Andre, the stage and film director and actor.         Mrs. Gregory directed a number of documentaries, including three dealing with the Polish director Jerzy Grotowski; the last, "Art as Vehicle," completed in 1990, examined his complex work process. Her other films include "Rings on the Water," a documentary about peace movements in the United States and the Soviet Union. Joseph Papp presented that film at the Public Theater in 1983.         In the 1970's, she was the executive director of an organization called A Bunch of Experimental Theaters. In that role, she was responsible for the administration and touring of a number of New York City avant-garde theaters. A strikingly beautiful woman, she also appeared on the cover of the first issue of Lear's magazine.         Mrs. Gregory was born in Bremen, Germany, and graduated from the University of Geneva and Ecole des Interpretes in Geneva. She spent most of her life in the United States. After many years in New York, she and Mr. Gregory moved to Santa Ynez last year. She recently completed a film script, "My Mother's Lover," about her life in Europe during World War II.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, an actor, and a daughter, Marina, both of Manhattan, and by a brother, Fred Nebelthau of Bremen. Funeral services will be held Friday at 10 A.M. at St. Thomas More's Church, 65 East 89th Street, Manhattan.       
         Taraja Linda Fraser Samuel, an important figure in the development of the New York City Board of Education's Mentoring Program, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. A resident of Brooklyn, she was 41 years old.         She died of cancer, her friends said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Samuel came to the city schools in 1983 with several years of experience in children's educational programs at New York University and the Community Service Society. The mentoring program became the first citywide initiative of its kind, matching adult volunteers with children in need of role models and guidance.         As its director, she shaped the program to train, monitor and evaluate such mentors, and its comprehensive approach came to be a national prototype. Ms. Samuel's work also came to the attention of Matilda Cuomo, the Governor's wife, and became a pilot for the New York State Mentoring Program.         In 1986, Ms. Samuel became director of the Office of School and Business Linkages to develop initiatives that involve people from the private sector and government with students, teachers and administrators.         Ms. Samuel, who graduated from Rider College and attended Montclair State College, left her post last year to seek a Ph.D. at Harvard University in the urban superintendents program. She attended the university until overcome by illness earlier this winter.         Ms. Samuel is survived by two teen-age sons, Obataiye and Oshunbunmi Samuel of Manhattan. She is also survived by her mother, Lillian B. Fraser of the Bronx, and her brother, Earl W. Fraser Jr. of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Uris, a Broadway and Hollywood actress and voice teacher known professionally as Dorothy Tree, died yesterday at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 85 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Joseph Uris of Manhattan.         Mrs. Uris, who was born in Brooklyn, started her acting career in the late 1920's by playing a succession of parlor maids on Broadway. Her best-known film roles were the mother of Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien) in "Knute Rockne: All American" (1940), and Louis Calhern's invalid wife in "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950). Mrs. Uris was also a founding member of the Screen Actor's Guild.         Educated at Cornell and Teachers College of Columbia University, she taught voice and English diction at the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music.         She published four books, including "Everybody's Book of Better Speaking" and "To Sing in English."         In addition to her son, she is survived by a sister, Mimi Shapiro of Manhattan.       
         Ronnie Paris, a playwright, novelist and teacher, died on Feb. 4 at Kingston Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. She was 67 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Bearsville, N.Y.         She died of an aneurysm, said her son Peter Stein of New Haven.         Ms. Paris's plays have been produced in New York and regional theaters. They include "Yes, Yes, No, No," "Love Gotta Come by Saturday Night" and "The Killing Time."         Ms. Paris, who was born in Manhattan, earned degrees in drama from the University of California at Los Angeles and Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt. She was playwright in residence at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and taught at the School of Visual Arts and the New School in Manhattan.         In addition to her son Peter, she is survived by another son, Alexander Stein of Manhattan; a brother, William Paris of Nashville, and two granddaughters.       
         Jeanne F. Bernkopf, who edited "Scarlett" and many other best-selling books, died on Monday in Manhattan.  She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She was stricken and died while riding in a taxi, her family said. No exact cause of death has been determined.         Mrs. Bernkopf edited Kitty Kelley's unauthorized biographies on Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra as well as Alexandra Ripley's "Scarlett," the sequel to "Gone with the Wind."         Several prominent writers sought her to edit their work. Joseph A. Wambaugh, for example, used her on a score of his books. Ms. Kelley and the novelist James Clavell specified in their publishing contracts that Mrs. Bernkopf be their editor. Other popular authors she edited included Michael Korda, Erich Segal, Wayne Dyer, Joshua Logan, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Bach and Robert Ludlum.         "She was really an author's editor -- strict but loving," said Lawrence Hughes, the former president of William Morrow & Company, one of the publishers for whom she worked. The others included Delacorte, Dell, Dutton, MacMillan and Bantam. She also worked as a freelance editor.         Mrs. Bernkopf was born in Manhattan and grew up there and in Woodmere, L.I. After graduating from Smith College, she went directly into publishing.         Surviving are her husband, Michael, a mathematics professor at Pace University; three stepchildren, David of Manhattan, Daniel of Highland Park, Ill., and Donald of Brooklyn, and three brothers, Charles Frank of Ardsley, N.Y., and Howard and Edward Frank, both of Boston.       
         Paula Ruth Oboler Schwartz, a psychotherapist, social worker and civil rights advocate, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. Her family would not give her age.         She died of cancer, her family said.         In the 1960's she was a caseworker for the Suffolk County Social Services Department, worked for the National Council on Aging and was the community relations director for the Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality.         In the 1970's she was the social-services coordinator for the Community Affairs Department in Islip, L.I., for two years and taught at Adelphi's School of Social Work for six years. Her psychotherapy practice began in 1975 and continued until her death.         Over the years she also worked as a consultant for the American Foundation for the Blind and Mount Sinai Medical Center. She also organized conferences on bereavement for Yeshiva University.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Queens. After graduating from the University of New Mexico, she earned a master's degree in social work at Adelphi University.         Her husband, Gerald Schwartz, a chemist and industrial hygienist, is dead. Her companion for the last several years was Paul Secchia.         Surviving are two sons, Steven, of Huntington Station, L.I., and Roy, of Kentfield, Calif., and one grandchild.       
         Dr. Carole Chenitz-Manley, a nursing administrator, educator and researcher who became an advocate for women with AIDS, died Tuesday at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. She was 45 years old and lived in Greenbrae.         The cause of death was AIDS-related pneumonia, her family said.         When Dr. Chenitz-Manley learned she had AIDS in 1988, she quit her job at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco and began speaking around the country for the National Association of People with AIDS. Her focus was on women. She did not disclose how she was infected except to say it was not by exposure to an AIDS patient in medical work.         Dr. Chenitz-Manley was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Kings County Hospital Center School of Nursing and Boston College and earned a master's degree and a doctorate at Columbia University.         At her retirement she was the associate chief for research in the nursing service at the hospital and an assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco. She also worked in family therapy at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto.         Her first marriage, to William Chenitz, ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, Ray Manley; two daughters, Rebecca Chenitz of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Kim Manley of Greenbrae; a sister, Lucille Allison of Greenbrae, and her mother, Yvette Allison of Summerfield, Fla.       
         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.         Then she returned to the university's law school, becoming its third female graduate. She worked in her father's firm, then married Reuben Oscar Everett and worked with him. Later she was a partner in the firm of Everett and Hancock. Her practice was mostly probate, real estate and family law.         She served 20 years on the Durham City Council after being elected in nonpartisan balloting. She was active in the real estate business and was a founder of WRDC-TV in Raleigh, N.C. She was also an elder in the First Presbyterian Church.         Surviving are her son, Robinson O. Everett of Durham, retired chief judge of the United States Court of Military Appeals, and three grandsons.       
         Linda M. Arenth, a nursing executive and innovator in the care of cancer patients, died Feb. 9 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was 59 years old and lived in Baltimore.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Arenth was the vice president of nursing and patient services at Hopkins. Earlier, she was the first director of nursing at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, where she developed the system now used nationally to designate nursing services for different types of cancer patients. She was the first recipient of the national Oncology Nursing Society's award for excellence in the administration of cancer nursing.         She was also on the boards of the Foundation for Nursing of Maryland and Health Care for the Homeless.         Born in Orange, Calif., she grew up in nearby Bellflower. She graduated from Cottey College in Nevada, Mo., in 1952 and earned a nursing degree from the University of Southern California in 1955 and a master's degree from the University of Maryland in 1974. She was a doctoral candidate at Columbia University.         She was divorced from Donald Arenth, a designer who died last year.         She is survived by two sons, Craig of Albuquerque, N.M., and Sean of Frostburg, Md.; two sisters, Janet Morgan of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Maureen Morgan of Ossining, N.Y.; two brothers, Peter Magnusson of Spokane, Wash., and Dennis Magnusson of Boston, Mass.       
         Shirley Berman, whose daughter, born with Down Syndrome, inspired her to wage a battle for a New Jersey law requiring doctors to inform parents if their unborn child is retarded, died on Feb. 8 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 55 years old and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Berman, a social worker, began a legal battle after her daughter Sharon, now 17, was born with Down Syndrome. Mrs. Berman contended that her doctor failed to tell her she risked having a retarded child and that the fetus could have been tested for the condition.         In 1979, the New Jersey State Supreme Court ruled that doctors could be sued for "wrongful birth" if their negligence deprived a mother of her right to an abortion and a child was born with defects.         Mrs. Berman worked for the Westchester Association for Retarded Children. A native of Montreal, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree from McGill University in Canada, a master's in art therapy in 1981 from the College of New Rochelle and a master's in social work from Fordham University in 1988.         She is survived by her husband, Paul; two daughters, Sharon, at home, and Deborah, of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Jonathan, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Minnie Segal of Montreal, and two brothers, Bernard and Henry Segal, both of Montreal.       
         Angela Carter, a novelist and short-story writer, died at her home in London on Sunday. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for Farrar, Straus & Giroux, her publisher in New York.         Ms. Carter's work was widely praised in Britain, although less widely known in the United States. She was the author of more than a half-dozen macabre novels and a polemical study of the Marquis de Sade, "The Sadeian Woman."         Her novels included "The Magic Toyshop," "Several Perceptions" and "Nights of the Circus." A number of her works were regarded as fairy tales with modern morals. Wrote for Radio and Films         British critics often described Ms. Carter's writing style as "magic realism," but she believed the label was not quite accurate. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, she said: "It's more realism than not. I can't define it until after it's done except that it is definitely fiction. It's more in the genre of Latin American writers like Garcia Marquez and Borges."         Whatever the label, Ms. Carter's interest in fantasies, fairy tales and dreams was lifelong. She wrote radio scripts, short stories, children's books and screenplays, one of which became the 1984 film "The Company of Wolves." Her 1991 novel, "Wise Children," was about the illegitimate twin daughters of a celebrated Shakespearean actor.         Ms. Carter was born in 1940 in Eastbourne. She began her writing career as a journalist on a South London weekly, The Croydon Advertiser. Later, she studied English literature at the University of Bristol, then began to write cultural criticism for New Society, The New Statesman and other publications.         From 1976 to 1978, Ms. Carter was a fellow in creative writing at Sheffield University in England, and in 1980 and 1981 she was a visiting professor in the writing program at Brown University in Providence, R.I. She also taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.         She is survived by her husband, Mark Pearce, and a son, Alexander.       
         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Shirley R. Levittan, an Acting State Supreme Court judge from 1974 until she retired last year, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pemphigus vulgaris, a rare skin disease, a court spokeswoman said.         Before her service on the State Supreme Court, Justice Levittan sat on New York City's Criminal Court and Civil Court, where she was first appointed in 1969. Before her appointment, she was a law clerk to Justice Samuel H. Hofstadler of State Supreme Court.         Judge Levittan, who was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 8, 1918, graduated from Barnard College in 1939 and received a master's degree in French literature a year later at Syracuse University. During World War II, she was attached to the Office of Strategic Services in Paris, London and Germany. She also worked as the executive assistant to the Principal of the Ramaz School, a Jewish day school on Manhattan's East Side. Taught French and English         After traveling and teaching English and French, she entered New York Law School, where she got a law degree in 1956. She worked for several years in private practice and was appointed to several state and city commissions, including the Temporary Commission on the Courts, where she drafted reports on the Family Court and adoption as well as drafted proposed legislation.         Justice Levittan served as an officer of the New York Women's Bar Association and was a member of the New York city and state bar associations and the National Association of Women Lawyers.         During her judicial career, she wrote and lectured often on the Constitution, adoption, pornography, alimony and divorce and the rights of children.         The judge, who was not married, is survived by a sister-in-law, Olive Levittan of Halifax, Nova Scotia.       
         Susan Kaplan Hopwood, a marketing and sales executive in New York City, died on Feb. 8 at her home in Newtonville, Mass. She was 55 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, her family said.         Mrs. Hopwood was advertising sales manager of Barron's, the business weekly, in the 1970's. Advertising lineage doubled in three years under her direction, and she helped initiate the overseas distribution for the publication. Moving to the parent of Barron's, Dow Jones & Company, she helped start "The Wall Street Journal Report" programs on radio and television.         From 1982 to 1988 she headed public relations for Advertising Age magazine. She ran its annual creative workshop, attracting marketing and advertising agencies from 47 countries, and helped institute annual awards for the best television commercials.         She also helped the International Advertising Association organize its annual conferences from 1986 to 1989, including its first gathering in Beijing. Recently she worked on marketing for the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Art News magazine and World Paper, an international news supplement for other publications.         For several years she worked on the board of the Manhattan Theater Club.         She was born in Brooklyn. Mrs. Hopwood was an alumna of Finch College and earned a master's degree in business from New York University.         Her marriage to Seymour N. Kaplan ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, David J. Hopwood; a daughter, Kari E. Kaplan of Manhattan; a son, Kenneth N. Kaplan of Queens; her mother, Claire Nossiter of Manhattan; a brother, Robert Singer of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and three stepchildren.       
         Isabelle Siegel, a sculptor, died on Tuesday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 49 years old.         She took her own life, her family said.         Between 1984 and 1990, Ms. Siegel had three one-person shows at the Kraushaar Galleries in New York City. She also had shows at the Pace Gallery in New York and at other galleries in the United States and in Brazil and Peru.         She was born in New York and received a bachelor's degree at Sarah Lawrence College; she also studied at Columbia University, the Art Students League, the Delehanty Institute and the Escola de Artes Visuals in Rio de Janeiro.         She is survived by a son, Justin Greene of New York; two brothers, Martin and William Paul Siegel of Fort Worth, and a sister, Caryl Stern of New York.       
         Frances Young Tang, a philanthropist in the field of education and a preservationist specializing in landmark buildings, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old and also had homes in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Vail, Colo.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Oscar L. Tang.         The beneficiaries of Mrs. Tang's philanthropy included the Department of East Asian Studies at Duke University, the Chinese language program at Skidmore College and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. She was a trustee of Phillips Academy at the time of her death and had been on the executive committee of the school's development board.         She was also president of Vencura Ltd., a Manhattan-based company that rehabilitates landmark buildings and has been doing work in Vail, Colo. She had also managed a Chinese catering business.         Mrs. Tang was born in Paris, the daughter of Kuangson Young, a Nationalist Chinese career diplomat who was executed during World War II by the Japanese in the Philippines. She came to the United States on an American troop ship and grew up in Manhattan.  She graduated in 1957 from Abbot Academy in Andover, Mass., which later merged with Phillips Academy, and in 1961 from Skidmore College.         She was married in 1960 to Mr. Tang, who is the president of Reich & Tang, a financial services firm with headquarters in Manhattan.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Juliana Koo of Manhattan, who is the widow of V. K. Wellington Koo, a Nationalist Chinese diplomat who was an ambassador to Washington and a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague; three daughters, Tracy Tang Limpe, Dana and Kristin, all of Manhattan; a son, Kevin, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Genevieve Young of Manhattan and Shirley Young of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Manhattan.       
         Anne Pappenheimer Forbes, a noted endocrinology researcher and clinician, died on Tuesday at her home in Milton, Mass. She was 80 years old.         She died of Hodgkin's disease, her family said.         Dr. Forbes was chosen in 1939 as the associate of Dr. Fuller Albright, the chief of endocrinology at the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.         They and their colleagues helped develop endocrinology. She participated in the identification of many diseases, including Forbes-Albright Syndrome, a pituitary gland ailment.         She became a professor at the medical school and a doctor at the hospital, where she helped create the Ovarian Dysfunction Clinic.         She worked with several hospitals in Paris in 1954 and 1955 and taught at the Pahlevi University in Shiraz, Iran, from 1967 to 1969.         After retiring in 1980, she took up gardening and raising ponies and sheep, shearing the wool herself and spinning and dyeing it by hand.         Dr. Forbes was born in New York City. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1932 and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1936 and interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1936 to 1938.         Surviving are her husband, William H.; three daughters, Beatrice F. Manz of Milton and Andrea F. Schoenfeld and Elise F. Pachter, both of Washington; two sons, Peter M. of Milton and Anthony W. of Belmont, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two brothers, Alwin M. Pappenheimer of Watertown, Mass., and John R. Pappenheimer of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Marion F. Schappel, a retired vice president at Citibank and one of the first women there to reach that rank, died on Wednesday at her home in Somers, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Miss Schappel was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Mahwah, N.J. She started at Citibank when she was 18, after graduation from high school. Her first job was as a page. She worked her way up to become secretary to a branch manager. After years of experience, she often found herself explaining procedures to younger male executive trainees.         In 1961 she was promoted to assistant manager, only the third woman in the bank's 151-year history to hold such a post. By 1964 there were a dozen female assistant managers and she was chosen from them to study at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She and 22 other students from other banks that year were the first women admitted at Stonier.         In 1965 she was one of four women promoted to assistant vice president at Citibank and in 1972 became a vice president. Most of her work was in branch banking. She spent 22 years in the branch at the bank's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan and became its manager. She was also manager of the branch in the Pan Am Building. She retired from full-time work in 1987 but continued as a consultant to the bank for three years.         Surviving are two brothers, Robert B. of Pasco, Wash., and Richard B. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.       
         Mary Childs Black, an art historian, folk art expert, former museum director and writer, died yesterday at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said M. J. Gladstone, a friend.         Mrs. Black's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th- and 19th-century artists, attributions she based largely on social history.         Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States, Britain or Israel. She made her most important discovery in the late 1960's, when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man, Ammi Phillips, an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut. She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book "Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter, 1788-1865," which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge, folk art collectors. The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, where she had organized the first major show of Phillips's work. A Start at Williamsburg         Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg, and was named director in 1961.         She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art. In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society, where she remained as the curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts until 1982, when she was abruptly dismissed by the director, Dr. James B. Bell.         Mrs. Black protested the dismissal and was widely supported in the museum world. After a complaint was filed with Federal and state agencies contending that the society had violated sex- and age-discrimination laws, the society settled out of court, awarding Mrs. Black a sum equal to the back pay and vacation owed to her, and restoring her full pension. Dr. Bell resigned in 1988.         At her death, Mrs. Black was working on an exhibition of Colonial American painters to be presented at the New-York Historical Society, said Barbara Knowles Debs, the director and president. A Childhood Interest         Mrs. Black often said her interest in folk art stemmed from seeing Erastus Salisbury Field's 19th-century portraits of her ancestors in her grandparents' home when she was a child in Pittsfield, Mass., where she was born.         Mrs. Black graduated from the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1943, did graduate work at Catholic University in Washington and earned a master's degree in art history at George Washington University in 1952.         Her books include "Old New York in Early Photographs" (1973), "What Is American in American Art" (1971), "Erastus Salisbury Field" (1984) and "Gracie Mansion: A History of the New York Mayor's House" (1984). She was the co-author with Jean Lipman of "American Folk Painting" (1967).         She is survived by a daughter, Merrill Black of New Durham, N.H., and a grandson.       
         Dr. Gloria Friedman Franklin, a psychoanalyst and faculty member of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. Girard Franklin, also a psychoanalyst.         Dr. Friedman, as she was known professionally, felt it important not to hide her illness because of the effect on therapy, her husband said. When she assumed the presidency of the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society in May 1990, she gave an address titled, "Impact of a Therapist's Life -- Threatening Illness on the Therapeutic Situation." The address was published last year by the magazine Contemporary Psychoanalysis.         At the time of her death, Dr. Friedman was a training and supervising analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan besides being a member of the faculty. She was to start teaching a course on women's issues in psychoanalysis next week.         She was also a training and supervising analyst at the Institute for Psychotherapy, an attending psychologist at Roosevelt Hospital and a lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University.         She was particularly known for her work on mother-daughter relationships. In a study on raising children in The New York Times Magazine in March 1985, Dr. Friedman was quoted as saying: "The cultural expectations will always be more powerful than any biological differences. From day one, a mother treats a boy baby differently from a girl baby. Cultural imprinting is so subtle that we can't help ourselves. But it's not a bad thing. We're raising them for the culture they have to live in."         Born and raised a New Yorker, Dr. Friedman graduated from New York University, from which she also received a Ph.D. She earned a master's degree in psychology from City College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Gary, of San Francisco, and two daughters, Lisa, of Philadelphia, and Eve Lynes, of San Mateo, Calif.       
         Rose Korn Hirschman, a real-estate lawyer and volunteer at the United Nations and other organizations, died Jan. 24 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver failure, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up there and in Brooklyn. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at New York University. She began practicing law in Manhattan with her brother, Ashton Korn, and after his death worked on her own.         For nine years she represented the International Federation of Women Lawyers at United Nations commissions dealing with discrimination, minorities, women, economics, crime, commodities trade, human rights and population growth.         She was a past president of the Sisterhood of the Community Synagogue, vice president of the Congregation Emanuel Sisterhood and chairwoman of its youth activities and board member of the Young Women's Hebrew Association. She headed the Mount Vernon branch of the American Red Cross and served on the board of its Westchester County chapter. She was also on the boards of the Mount Vernon Nursing School and Mount Vernon Hospital and founded the hospital's volunteer services.         Her husband, Dr. Sol Hirschman, is dead. She is survived by two daughters, Judge Aileen Hirschman Belford of Fall River, Mass., and E. Judith Hirschman Berger of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Richard James Hirschman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Emilia Sherman Maurer, who put the Rockettes through their paces from the gala opening of Radio City Music Hall on Dec. 27, 1932, until she retired as director of the dancers more than 40 years later, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett, L.I. She lived in Point Lookout, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Miss Sherman, who used her maiden name professionally, had kept her age a secret and left "explicit instructions" that it remain so, her son said. She died after a long illness, he said.         A close associate of Russell E. Markert, who founded the Rockettes in 1926, Miss Sherman choreographed many of the young dancers' routines. These included signature tap routines as well as her specialty, dance presentations she developed from the folk dances of many nations.         When Mr. Markert moved his troupe to Rockefeller Center in 1932, Miss Sherman became its captain as well as a dancer in the chorus line. She drilled the other dancers, showed them their steps and movements and kept them in line.         She quickly became a principal aide to Mr. Markert and, for more than 15 years, was his associate director. She became director upon his retirement in 1971. She retired in 1973.         Miss Sherman, a native of New York City, attended Professional Children's School here and later studied ballet and flamenco dancing. She made her vaudeville debut at the age of 6 and first went on a Broadway stage when she was 12 years old.         She learned her first tap steps from another dancer in Shubert Alley minutes before an audition, winning a job as a specialty act. From then on, she was known for her ability to pick up steps quickly and create new ones on her own.         This led her to choreography as a career. At Radio City, this entailed conjuring up a new spectacle with every change in the movie program, about once a month. Miss Sherman also played den mother and sergeant major to the 46 precision dancers in the troupe, any 36 of whom kicked off four times daily in a wheeling straight line nearly a city block long. In addition, she rehearsed the dancers four hours a week.         Miss Sherman is survived by her husband of 56 years, Henry S. Maurer; their son, Henry S. Jr., of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a daughter, Arnelle Liblit of Commack, L.I., and one grandson.       
         Evelyn Lord Smithson, a professor of classics and a noted archeologist who studied Greece in the Homeric age, died on Monday at her home in Amherst, N.Y. She was 68 years old.         She died of cancer, according to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where she was on the faculty.         For more than 40 years Dr. Smithson traveled each summer to work on the excavations of the ancient agora, or marketplace, in Athens that were supervised by the American School of Classical Studies there.         The Greek period that she studied, from 1200 to 900 B.C., is challenging because of its lack of a literary record. She focused on pottery and its decorations for insights into the culture.         Dr. Smithson was born in Indiana.  She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1944, a master's degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1946 and a doctorate in classical archeology and Greek from Bryn Mawr in 1956. She studied at the American School in Athens from 1948 to 1950.         From 1951 to 1962 she was a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and then worked at the University at Buffalo. She served two terms as chairwoman of the classics department.         Dr. Smithson was divorced. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Shirley Ullman Wedeen, a Brooklyn College educator and past chairwoman of the City University's Faculty Senate, died on Thursday at home in Brooklyn.         She was 65 years old and died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Wedeen taught education courses at Brooklyn College since 1948 and was also assistant dean of students from 1966 to 1968.         Her academic specialty was reading skills. She created the first remedial reading program in the City University system and ran it from 1961 to 1964. She also wrote two books, "College Remedial Reader" (Putnam, 1958) and "Advanced College Reader (Putnam, 1963).         She was elected chairwoman of the Faculty Senate for the entire City University from 1986 to 1990, and in that post sat as an ex-officio member on the university's Board of Trustees. She had also served as the Senate's vice chairwoman for four years and its Governance Committee chairwoman for two years.         Dr. Wedeen graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946. At New York University she earned a master's degree in guidance counseling in 1947 and a doctorate in psychology in 1951.         Surviving are her husband, Dr. Peter Wedeen; two sons, Dr. Van Wedeen of Boston, and Dr. Glenn Wedeen of Manhattan, and her father, Hugo Ullman of Brooklyn.       
         Helen Deutsch, the award-winning screenwriter for "Lili," "I'll Cry Tomorrow" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and co-author of "National Velvet," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 years old.         She had been under nursing care and died of natural causes, the medical examiner's office said.         Her script for "Lili" was nominated for an Academy Award in 1953 and won Cannes Film Festival and Writers Guild of America prizes and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Golden Globe award.         The film told of an orphan, played by Leslie Caron, smitten with a carnival magician. One critic, Bosley Crowther, called the movie "lovely and beguiling" and "touched with the magic of romance and the shimmer of masquerade." It later became a musical hit, "Carnival!" on Broadway.         Miss Deutsch, who never learned to type and instead relied on a old Dictaphone, was prolific. Besides her 15 screenplays, she wrote more than 20 short stories for magazines, hundreds of newspaper articles and several plays and television scripts. She was a lyricist as well. Among her songs was "Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo," which she dismissed as "dreadful." Organized Drama Critics Circle         Although not a performer, she played many other roles in show business. Early in her career she ran a theater company, worked as a publicist and covered theater for The New York Herald-Tribune and The New York Times. As a protest to the Pulitzer Prize selections, she organized the New York Drama Critics Circle. She also worked for the New York Theater Guild, and later was a production consultant for stage, film and television.         Her screenwriting career started with a smash. "National Velvet" (1944), which was about youngsters training a horse, was named one of the 10 best films that year and propelled the young Elizabeth Taylor to stardom.         That same year she followed with another acclaimed work, "The Seventh Cross," in which Spencer Tracy gave one of the best performances of his career, portraying a refugee from a Nazi death camp.         Most of her screenplays were for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and were adaptations of other works. Her range was wide, from psychological drama to outdoor adventure to musicals.         "I'll Cry Tomorrow" (1956), featuring Susan Hayward, was the true story of Lillian Roth's searing battle with alcoholism. "King Solomon's Mines" (1950) with Stewart Granger was a scenic safari picture. "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" (1964) was a big, brassy musical about a survivor of the Titanic, and the movie garnered six Oscar nominations.         But her film-writing career ended on a sour note. "Valley of the Dolls" (1967) was a steamy box office success but critically scorned. Miss Deutsch disavowed authorship and said Jacqueline Susann, on whose novel the movie was based, had meddled with the script.         For television she wrote "Jack and the Beanstalk," starring Joel Grey, for NBC in 1956. The following year she wrote "The General Motors 50th Anniversary Show."         Miss Deutsch was born in Manhattan and graduated from Barnard College in 1927. While still a senior, she started managing the Provincetown Players, continuing till the troupe went out of business. She co-wrote a book about it in 1931, "The Provincetown," which was republished in 1972. She took up freelance writing, and her stories appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Redbook.         When Hollywood beckoned, she went to California, living there from about 1946 to 1966. Returning to the East Coast, she called herself "a recluse in New York."         Miss Deutsch was a student of medieval English, French, German and English and a Sanskrit scholar. She collected rare books and manuscripts and donated a significant collection to Boston University.         She had a brief marriage that was annulled. There are no immediate survivors.

         Myra de Haven Woodruff, a specialist in child development who helped shape the modern nursery-school system during and after World War II, died on Friday at Medford Leas, a retirement community in Medford, N.J., where she had lived for the last 20 years. She was 95 years old.         Miss Woodruff, a native of Ogden, Utah, graduated from Oberlin College and Teachers College at Columbia University. She worked as a psychologist and helped establish programs for nursery schools and parent education in North Carolina and Pennsylvania before going to work for the New York State Department of Education in 1941.         Three years later, she joined the department's Bureau of Child Development and Parent Education. She was bureau chief from 1953 until her retirement in 1966. She was a past president of the Association for Childhood Education International and the author of many articles for professional publications.         Miss Woodruff left no immediate survivors.       
         Alice Lee Marriott, an anthropolgist and author who helped popularize American Indian culture and the role of Indian women, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Oklahoma City, Okla. She was 82 years old and lived in Oklahoma City.         She died of heart failure, said Margaret Lefranc Schoonover, a friend and colleague.         Though she was not the first to study American Indians, Miss Marriott promoted an appreciation of their culture by a wider audience and helped break the stereotype of Indians as uncivilized savages.         "Indians are not beautiful, quaint and exotic creatures, like museum pieces," she said in an interview in 1963. "They have a very rich and very complex culture with deep metaphysical and philosophical meanings."         Her more than 20 books were noted for reporting the unique culture of Indians with sensitivity while also portraying their universal humanity. She lived near Indian settlements and often stayed with tribes.         She was a specialist in arts and crafts for the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and helped organize two significant early exhibits of Indian art, at the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1941.         Her first book, on the Kiowas, was "The Ten Grandmothers" (University of Oklahoma, 1945). A New York Times review called it "remarkable" and "distinguished." Another major work was "Maria: The Potter of San Ildefonso" (University of Oklahoma, 1948).         The Christian Science Monitor in 1963 said she "has probably done more than any other woman to contribute to the understanding of the American Indian, his plight, his spiritual power and the impact on him of white civilization."         Born in Wilmette, Ill., she graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1930 and in 1935 became the first woman to earn a doctorate in anthropology there.         She is survived by a brother, Richard, of Los Angeles.       
         Lettie Gay Carson, who fought to save railroad service both in New York and Pennsylvania, died on Wednesday at her home in Newtown, Pa. She was 91 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Sally Carson, said.         Mrs. Carson, who was born in Pike County, Ill., and graduated from the University of Illinois, came to New York in the early 1920's. From 1927 until 1933, she was director of the Home Institute of The New York Herald Tribune.         In 1924, she married Gerald H. Carson, an advertising executive, who later wrote several books as a social historian, including "Cornflake Crusade."         When the Carsons moved to a retirement home in Newtown, Pa., Mrs. Carson organized a group to preserve rail service in and around Philadelphia. Her husband died in 1990.         Surviving in addition to her daughter are three grandchildren.       
         Ellen H. Johnson, an influential art historian and curator who taught at Oberlin College in Ohio for 38 years, died yesterday at her home in Oberlin. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said Elizabeth A. Brown, the curator of modern art at the museum.         At the time of her death, Miss Johnson was emerita professor of art at the college and honorary curator of modern art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin.         On a national level, Miss Johnson was a powerful force in the promotion of contemporary art. She gave the work of several prominent New York artists early exposure through her curatorship of the Allen Art Museum's well-known Young Americans series. She was the first to show the black-striped paintings that established Frank Stella's reputation, and she also exhibited works by Claes Oldenburg, Larry Poons and Bruce Nauman before the artists were widely known. Mr. Oldenburg's first site-specific sculpture, "Three Way Plug," was commissioned by Miss Johnson in 1970 for the Oberlin campus.         Miss Johnson's persistence in seeking out young artists and urging acquisition of their work helped make the Allen Museum one of the country's leading institutions in the contemporary art field. And generations of students, among them Agnes Gund, now the president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, were influenced by the popular course in modern art that she initiated at Oberlin.         Miss Johnson left her eclectic art collection, ranging from Cezanne to the American contemporary artist Judy Pfaff, to the Allen Art Museum, where it is currently on view. In her honor, the main portion of an addition to the museum, designed by Robert Venturi and opened in 1977, was named the Ellen Johnson Gallery of Modern Art.         Ellen Hulda Elizabeth Johnson was born on Nov. 25, 1910, in Warren, Pa. Her affiliation with Oberlin began early. She earned both her undergraduate and master's degrees there, and went on to postgraduate study at Uppsala university in Stockholm and the Sorbonne in Paris.         After a short stint as a lecturer and cataloguer at the Toledo Museum of Art, she returned to Oberlin in 1938 as a part-time instructor, and soon became a member of the regular teaching faculty. Her interest in Scandinavian art also led her to serve as visiting professor in the field at the University of Wisconsin in 1950-51, and to teach American art at Uppsala University in 1960.         In Oberlin, Miss Johnson lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, built for another owner between 1948 and 1950. Over a period of years, she painstakingly restored it and it became a showcase for her collection. She bequeathed the Wright house to Oberlin.         She is survived by a sister, Evelina Johnson McAvoy, of Erie, Pa., and a brother, Harry Johnson, of Warren.       
         Roberta Bender Grossman, the president and publisher of Zebra Books, died on March 13 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Walter Zacharius, the chairman of Kensington Publishing Corporation, which owns Zebra Books.         Mrs. Grossman was born in Brooklyn and attended New York University. When she founded Zebra Books with Mr. Zacharius in 1975, she became, at the age of 29, the youngest president of a paperback house. Over the next decade, she expanded the company's range of titles from historical romances to both paperback and hard-cover novels and general nonfiction. Authors published by the company, with whom Mrs. Grossman worked closely, included Jerzy Kosinski, Isaac Asimov and Joyce Carol Oates. In 1988, Zebra acquired Pinnacle Books, and Mrs. Grossman took on its presidency as well.         She is survived by her husband, Robin, and a daughter, Shoshanna.       
         Catherine Wolkonsky, a French and Russian teacher for 50 years and founding chairman of the Slavic Department at the State University of New York at Albany, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 96 years old and lived in Spring Valley, N.Y.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Born into a landowning family in St. Petersburg, she came to the United States in 1924. She taught French in Cooperstown, N.Y., until World War II, when Cornell University started training Army officers in Russian. She became the only woman on the faculty then. She was chairman and professor of Russian at Vassar College from 1946 to 1961, after which she led the Slavic Department at SUNY, Albany, until 1972.         Mrs. Wolkonsky continued to teach at the Russian Summer School at Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., until 1985, when she was 90 years old.         She is survived by her daughter, Maria Marr, of Spring Valley, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M. Ourisman of Bethesda, Md., and Robert B. Ourisman of Washington; her mother, Hannah Haydnet of Minneapolis; a sister, Patricia Chanin of New York City, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Beliveau Feuer, a scholar of Russian literature who ruffled the Soviet authorities by befriending dissident intellectuals during the cold war, died Sunday at The Cedars rehabilitation center in Charlottesville, Va. She was 65 years old and lived in Charlottesville, where she was a professor at the University of Virginia.         She died of complications after hip surgery, her family said.         Dr. Feuer published a novel at the age of 21 and, during a long career as an educator, headed the Slavic languages departments at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Toronto.         During a research visit to Russia in 1963, she brought in miniature copies of "Doctor Zhivago" and secretly passed out the contraband to dissidents. She also arranged for the manuscript of Anna Akhmatova's "The Requiem," a lengthy anti-Stalin poem, to be smuggled out of Russia, thus enabling its publication in the West.         Toward the end of Dr. Feuer's trip, she and her daughter were roughed up by Soviet agents in a sleeper compartment on a train, she later told American officials.         On another day, the police in Leningrad searched Dr. Feuer's possessions and demanded that she sign confessions of having met with dissidents. But having already memorized and destroyed her notes on those meetings, she admitted nothing and was let go.         Dr. Feuer helped Eastern European exiles settle in the West, bringing Czeslaw Milosz, the Polish poet and later a Nobel laureate, to Berkeley and Josef Skvorecky, an award-winning Czechoslovak novelist, to Toronto.         Dr. Feuer was born in Brooklyn and grew up mostly in Nutley, N.J. In 1946, she graduated from Vassar College, where she was the editor of the literary magazine. At the age of 21 she won Mademoiselle magazine's 1947 fiction award for a short story, and soon afterward Doubleday published her only novel, "Strike for the Heart," about a young woman's soul-searching.         She earned a master's degree at Columbia University in 1954 and a doctorate there in 1965 with a thesis based on research of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" manuscripts at his estate in Russia, where she stayed in 1963. That trip was her second to the country; in 1955 she was one of the first American exchange visitors permitted in the cold-war era.         Surviving are her husband, Lewis Feuer, a noted sociologist, philosopher, and social critic; a daughter, Robin F. Miller of Newton, Mass., a professor of Russian literature at Brandeis University, and three granddaughters.       
         Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.         She died of cancer, a relative said.         Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.         Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.         Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.         She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.       
         Maria-Helena Vieira da Silva, a painter prominently associated with the School of Paris, died in Paris on March 6. The Portuguese-born artist was 83 years old and had lived in Paris since 1928.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for the French Ministry of Culture.         Although Miss Vieira da Silva had been a French citizen since 1956, she was regarded by many as Portugal's greatest contemporary artist. Her poetic canvases, vast semi-abstractions in which mosaiclike patches of color were linked by lines into labyrinthine compositions, interested artists of the American Abstract Expressionist school, who first saw her work in New York in 1946.         To observe her 80th birthday in 1988, a major Vieira da Silva retrospective was presented at the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon and the Grand Palais in Paris. Her paintings are in important museum collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, the Tate Gallery in London, the Stedelijk in Amsterdam, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. She was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government and France's National Arts Prize in 1966. In 1961, she won the painting prize at the prestigious Sao Paulo Bienal in Brazil. One Theme Was War         The themes of her paintings are varied: landscapes, games, city streets, atmospheric effects, the seasons, spatial arrangements. Influences on her work ranged from the winding streets of her native Lisbon and the traditional glazed tiles of Portugal to the horrors of World War II. During that period, canvases like "Le Metro" and "The Disaster" of 1942 reflected the grim scene in Europe.         Miss Vieira da Silva was born in Lisbon on June 13, 1908. At 19, she began to study sculpture in Paris with Antoine Bourdelle and Charles Despiau; later she took up painting under the tutelage of Fernand Leger and Othon Friesz. Her first show was in 1933 at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, she and her husband, Arpad Szenes, a Hungarian-born painter she married in 1930, fled to Rio de Janeiro. There she did murals for the University of Agriculture and had several solo exhibitions. The couple's home in Rio became a gathering place for emerging Brazilian artists.         Miss Vieira da Silva's first postwar exhibition was in New York in 1946 at the Marian Willard Gallery. The next year, she returned to Paris, where she exhibited regularly, working until shortly before her death. She also had a studio in Lisbon, and a former silk factory near it is now being turned into a museum of her work.         Mr. Szenes died in 1985. The couple had no children.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M. Ourisman of Bethesda, Md., and Robert B. Ourisman of Washington; her mother, Hannah Haydnet of Minneapolis; a sister, Patricia Chanin of New York City, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Ruth Hammond, an actress whose career on Broadway spanned half a century, died in her sleep on Thursday, her 96th birthday, at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J.         Miss Hammond created the role of Cora in the 1939 hit play "Life With Father" and remained in the cast for the entire run of the show, missing only one performance in seven and a half years. Her first appearance on Broadway was in 1920 in "The Ouija Board"; her other credits included "Saturday's Children" with Ruth Gordon and "The Good Fairy" with Helen Hayes, as well as "Winterset," "The Women" and "Life With Mother."         Miss Hammond was born in Los Angeles, and was a graduate of the University of California in Berkeley. In addition to her acting, she was an artist known for portraits and caricatures.         She is survived by a son, Eric McDonald, of Langhorn, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Louise Speers Croix, a chemist who worked on anesthetics, died on Monday at the King James Care Center in Chatham Township, N.J. She was 72 years old and lived in Summit, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said a friend, Walter Mac Williams of Bernardsville.         Dr. Croix was born in Nanking, China, where her Presbyterian-missionary parents taught at the university. She graduated from Vassar College in 1940 with a chemistry major and earned her Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University in 1949.         She started a 35-year-career in 1949 with the Ohio Chemical and Surgical Division of the Air Reduction Company. Working in its laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., she specialized in anesthetics and related products. She retired in 1984. The company now is the Airco Gases Division of Britain's BOC Group.         She is survived by her brother, James Speers of Pensacola, Fla., and a sister, Elizabeth Bagley of Rock Hill, S.C.       
         Edna Simon Levine, a psychologist who founded many programs to help deaf people, died on April 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart ailment, a friend said.         Dr. Levine devoted her career to the problems of people with impaired hearing as an advocate, author, teacher, researcher, clinician and trainer of other professionals.         She organized the first comprehensive dictionary of sign language in 1964, which standardized the signs. She formed the Deaf Repertory Theater, helped create the Foundation for the Deaf and worked on adapting telephones for the deaf, including experiments with video telephones.         As a psychologist, Dr. Levine focused on helping deaf people cope with feelings of social isolation from hearing people. Directed U.N. Program         She directed a 1972 United Nations Task Force on Deafness and a 1974 national conference on training psychological workers for the deaf. She initiated the New York State Psychiatric Institute's mental health program for the deaf and founded New York University's research and training center for deafness rehabilitation, a forerunner of centers elsewhere.         Among her books were "Youth in a Soundless World" (New York University, 1956), "Psychology of Deafness" (Columbia University, 1960) and "Lisa and Her Soundless World" (Human Sciences, 1974), which was chosen as the children's book of the year by the Child Study Association of America. Her other honors included an honorary doctorate from Gallaudet University, which educates deaf students.         She was a past president of the Psychology Commission of the World Federation for the Deaf and a former board member of the American Psychological Association, the American Hearing Society, the Inter-Branch Library Association of New York and the New York League for the Hard of Hearing.         Dr. Levine, who was not deaf, was born in New York City and got started in the field after she trained as a teacher at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate in psychology at New York University, where she later taught educational psychology for 15 years. She also earned a master's in special education at Columbia.         Her husband, Dr. Matthew Levine, a psychiatrist, is deceased. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Han Schroeder, an architect, interior designer and educator, died on March 20 in the Boerhaave Clinic in Amsterdam. She was 73 years old and lived in Richmond.         She died after a short illness, said Janet De Cecilia, the coordinator of the interior design program at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I., where Ms. Schroeder had taught.         Ms. Schroeder was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Her family lived in Schroeder House, a landmark De Stilj house designed in 1924 by the architect Gerrit Rietveld, with whom Ms. Schroeder later worked, in collaboration with her mother, Truss Schroeder-Schraeder, an interior designer. From 1972 to 1987, Ms. Schroeder was the consulting architect for the restoration of the house, now a museum. Two of her drawings for the restoration are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Before immigrating to the United States in the early 1960's, she had her own architecture and interior design office in Amsterdam. In 1964 she settled on Long Island to teach interior design at Adelphi University and the Parsons School of Design, and three years later she was appointed professor at the New York Institute of Technology. In 1981 she moved to Richmond, where she taught at Virginia Commonwealth University until retiring as professor emerita in 1988. She was one of the first women to have their work represented in the archives of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va.         She is survived by a brother, Binnert, of the Hague.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.

         Louise Leonard Wright, who was active for many years in women's and foreign affairs, died on April 17 at Crosslands, a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 95 years old and had previously lived in Charlottesville, Va., and, until 1956, in Chicago.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         A native of Wilmette, Ill., she graduated from the University of Minnesota, which cited her for its Outstanding Achievement Award 50 years after she received a master's degree there.         The National League of Women Voters also honored Mrs. Wright for 50 years of service. She was a member of the league's national board in the 1930's and headed its government and foreign affairs department when the United States entered World War II. In testimony before the Senate on the country's neutral status in 1939, she also spoke for the American Association of University Women, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the National Board of the Young Women's Christian Association, the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Women's Trade Union League.

         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.

         Joan Hickcox Garrett-Goodyear, an associate professor of English at Smith College, died last Thursday at her home in South Hadley, Mass. She was 50 years old.         She committed suicide by asphyxiation, said her husband, Harold Garrett-Goodyear, a history professor at Mount Holyoke College.

         Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.         She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said.         Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.         She started as a financial aide in the Ossining urban renewal agency, then worked for the New York City Office of Management and Budget.

A native of New York City, Dr. Estrin attended Smith College and began medical studies at the University of Austria, in Vienna. She received her medical degree from the Women's Medical College, in Philadelphia.         Dr. Estrin, a pediatrician, centered her practice on the care of underprivileged children. Dr. Estrin retired from her practice in 1988 and moved to Los Angeles.         Dr. Estrin's husband, Dr. Irving Jonathan Estrin, died several years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Los Angeles, and James, of Yonkers; two daughters, Jennifer, of Los Angeles, and Judy, of San Luis Obispo, Calif., and two sisters, Gertrude Drachmanad, of New Rochelle, and Margaret Galgau, of Paris.       
         Madeleine Feldman Gutman, who promoted free music, art and other cultural events in Greenburgh, N.Y., died on May 10 at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers.         She was 68 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She died after an accident at home, her family said.         For 22 years Mrs. Gutman headed Greenburgh's Arts and Culture Committee, first as chairwoman and then as executive director. Financed by government, business and private donations, the committee presents concerts, exhibitions and lectures, drawing audiences from throughout Westchester County.         She emphasized cultural diversity that included Indian art, Sufi music, poetry competitions, chamber music, discussions on religion and Cambodian dance. She insisted on free admission and encouraged people to sample events and feel comfortable about leaving ones that did not appeal to them.         Mrs. Gutman was born in Manhattan. She privately studied piano, art and dance and graduated from New York University. Before running the cultural committee, she worked as an interior designer.         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Jeremiah, a lawyer in Manhattan; three daughters, Mara Ferris of Brookline, Mass., and Thea Gutman and Rebecca Menon, both of Manhattan; a sister, Naomi Fatouros of Bloomington, Ind., and two grandchildren.       
         Moira Dryer, an abstract artist known for working in glowing colors on sheets of plywood, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 34 years old.         She died of cancer, said James McKinley, a friend.         Ms. Dryer's distinctive painting method involved applying diaphanous washes of either casein or acrylic paint to big squares of wood, creating veiled, undulating patterns that could suggest an open landscape, the sea or a soft freehand tapestry. This process was inspired by the thin paint surfaces of the Italian Renaissance frescoes she saw on a trip to Florence in 1978. But her paintings rested firmly within the tradition of American postwar abstraction and related in particular to the work of Milton Avery, Morris Louis and the young Frank Stella.         Ms. Dryer was born in Toronto, a daughter of Pegeen Synge, an architect, and Douglas Dryer, a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto. She attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal and then transferred to the School of Visual Arts in New York City. There she studied with the painter Elizabeth Murray and graduated with honors in 1981. In January 1982 she married Victor Alzamora, a fellow student at the School of Visual Arts, who died in June 1983.         Since the early 1980's, Ms. Dryer's work has been included in numerous group exhibitions in museums and galleries around the country. Her first solo exhibition was held in 1986 at the John Good Gallery in Manhattan, and there were subsequent solo shows at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the Fred Hoffman Gallery in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Mario Diacono Gallery in Boston.         She is survived by her father, Ellis Dryer of Toronto; a brother, Matthew, of Buffalo; a sister, Dr. Dagny Dryer Murray, of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and a grandfather, John L. Synge of Dublin.       
         Dr. Alexandra Symonds, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who was deeply involved in broadening the consideration of women's issues in her field, died on May 20 at her home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Dr. Symonds died of pancreatic cancer, said Lily Harmon, her sister-in-law.         This month Dr. Symonds, a Fellow and former Trustee of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, received the organization's Presidential Award for Distinguished Service and Scientific Contributions.         Dr. Symonds earned a bachelor's degree at New York University in 1940 and a master's degree in pscyhology from the University of Wisconsin in 1944. She earned a medical degree from New York Medical College in 1948 and served her internship and residency at the Marine Hospital on Staten Island and at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Dr. Symonds developed a long relationship with Bellevue Hospital.         In addition to her private practice, Dr. Symonds, at the time of her death, was an associate attending in psychiatry at Bellevue. She was also an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, an associate psychoanalyst at the Karen Horney Clinic and a lecturer in family counseling at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was also the author of many articles on loneliness in adolescents, the problems of obesity and women's issues.         Dr. Symonds was a Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and chair of its Women's Caucus. She was also founder and first president of the Association of Women Psychiatrists and editor of its publication, News for Women in Psychiatry.         Among many honors, Dr. Symonds was a recipient of the Susan B. Anthony award of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, and the first recipient of the Association of Women Psychiatrists' Alexandra Symonds Award for her efforts on behalf of women.         Dr. Symonds is survived by her husband, Dr. Martin Symonds, a psychiatrist and deputy chief surgeon of the New York City Police Department; a sister, Edith Zuaro, of Long Island, two brothers, Milton Schacter and Dr. Sherman Schacter, both of Manhattan, two nephews and three nieces.       
         Lydia Joel, the former editor in chief of Dance Magazine and head of the dance department at the School of Performing Arts, died on Sunday at New York Hospital She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, said her husband, Edwin Miller.         As teacher and journalist, Miss Joel helped to increase appreciation of dance as an art and to raise standards of dance writing and training. Appointed editor in chief of Dance Magazine in 1952, she began to emphasize serious criticism, essays, photographic features and foreign reports. As a result, a publication that had previously been read largely by performers and teachers came to appeal to the general dance audience.         Through her early teaching activities in Texas, she acknowledged the importance of fostering dance across America. And at the School of Performing Arts in New York, she supervised a program that prepared young people for professional careers.  Studied Two Methods         Miss Joel, whose maiden name was Tarnower, was born in New York City. She received a bachelor's degree in English from New York University and did additional graduate work at Cornell University. She studied ballet at the School of American Ballet and modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and Hanya Holm, two leaders of the German modern dance that flourished before World War II. She also attended summer sessions of the Bennington (Vt.) School of Dance, the forerunner of today's American Dance Festival.         At Bennington in 1937, Miss Joel danced in the premiere of "Trend," Miss Holm's monumentally scaled depiction of social conflicts. In New York that same year, Miss Joel appeared in Max Reinhardt's production of "The Eternal Road."         She taught in 1938 at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and from 1938 to 1944 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she headed her own company.         Her first husband was the conductor Gerhard Joel; he died in 1946 but she retained Joel as her professional name. She married Mr. Miller, the entertainment editor of Seventeen magazine, in 1953.         Miss Joel joined the staff of Dance Magazine in 1947, working in the editorial and advertising departments. When she left the publication in 1969, the staff, under her guidance, had grown from 4 to 15 people.         Miss Joel directed the dance department of the School of Performing Arts from 1973 until her retirement in 1984, producing the high school's annual concerts and arranging a performance by 12 of its students at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982.         She served on the board of directors of the American College Dance Festival, the Association of American Dance Companies and the National Association for Regional Ballet, and contributed articles to Vogue, Parents Magazine and other publications. In recent years, she lectured and wrote about Catherine de' Medici, the Renaissance monarch who influenced the development of ballet in European courts.         In addition to her husband, Miss Joel is survived by a son, Eric Miller of Manhattan, and three brothers, Irving Tarnower of Teaneck, N.J., Dr. William Tarnower of Topeka, Kans., and Gerald Tarnower of Dallas.       
         Elizabeth David, a food writer credited with almost single-handedly changing the cooking in her native England, died on Friday at her home in London. She was 78 years old.         She died of a stroke, British press reports said.         Alice Waters, who is often described as the mother of modern American cooking, said Mrs. David was her greatest inspiration. "When I go back and read her book now," Ms. Waters said, "I feel I plagiarized them. All of it seeped in so much, it's embarrassing to read them now."         Grand dame of the kitchen, doyenne of modern cookery, expert on Mediterranean cookery, Mrs. David first displayed her importance with the publication of "A Book of Mediterranean Food," in 1950. The ration-weary English could barely buy enough to eat but they were enchanted by her descriptions of meals that included eggs, butter, seafood, tomatoes, olives, apricots, ingredients that were difficult, or impossible, to obtain. Foods that are taken for granted today in England -- garlic, olive oil, Parmigiano Reggiano -- were unknown and generally viewed with suspicion before Mrs. David.  Renown Spreads in Britain         The following year "French Country Cooking" was published, followed in 1954 by "Italian Food," "Summer Cooking," in 1955 and "French Provincial Cooking" in 1960. Articles in Vogue, House & Garden, The Sunday Times and The Spectator helped to spread her influence throughout a country whose culinary renown has been generally confined to fish and chips and spotted Dick.         Her evocative writings drew her fans to undiscovered but enticing worlds.         "In other markets, on other shores, the unfamiliar fishes may be vivid, mysterious, repellant, fascinating and bright with splendid color," she wrote in "Italian Food." "Only in Venice do they look good enough to eat. In Venice even ordinary sole and ugly great skate are striped with delicate lilac lights, the sardines shine like newly minted silver coins, pink Venetian scampi are fat and fresh, infinitely enticing in the early dawn."         But Mrs. David's books were always about more than just food. "Her esthetic is about simplicity and a kind of fragrance," Ms. Waters said. "She had a great sense of the seasons and always about life around the table -- the setting, the conversation. It was always more than just the food because her recipes were not very specific, to say the least. I remember being frustrated, but it made you think.         "She was saying something pretty profound about the recipe process -- that food changes all the time. It's never, never the same. The climate, the location, all made a difference." White Truffles at Olney's         Richard Olney, an American food and wine writer who lives in France, met Mrs. David in the early 1970's when he was living in London. Mr. Olney, whose book, "Simple French Food," (reprinted by Macmillan in 1992) also had a remarkable impact on American cooking, said Mrs. David's writing style, the lack of specificity in her recipes, did not appeal to American publishers, and delayed her fame in this country.         In 1979, he introduced Mrs. David to Ms. Waters, who, 10 years before, had hung around her shop just to get a glimpse of her but never had the courage to introduce herself. The three of them had a six-hour white truffle lunch at Mr. Olney's apartment. "I bought a huge jar of white truffles from Italy," recalled Ms. Waters. "There must have been five the size of golf balls. We shaved them over the top of sausages. We shaved them over equal parts of Parmesan cheese. We had them over pasta, with an omelet, with olive oil and toast. It was a truffle extravaganza."         Eventually some of Mrs. David's friends persuaded her to visit the United States, a country about which she was "a little bit snobbish," said Mr. Olney. "She was treated like a star and she adored it, but she would never admit it."         Born to the English upper class, her studies at the Sorbonne forever altered her destiny. She lived with a Parisian family that she later described as "both exceptionally greedy and exceptionally well-fed." She forgot what she had learned at the university and tried, instead, to recreate the food to which she had been exposed.         When she returned to England she worked briefly as an actress, then as a sales clerk for Worth. Her brief marriage in 1944 to Anthony David, a British Army officer, was childless.         In 1965, she opened a kitchen shop that bore her name and in 1970 published "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen." Three years later she severed her connections with the shop after a falling out with her partners. Her last cook book, "English Bread and Yeast Cookery," appeared in 1973. Unlike her earlier books it was more for reference than reading. Her last book, "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine," a collection of earlier writings, was published in 1984.         "She had an appreciation of all that was simple and fresh," said Mr. Olney. "There was a complete lack of interest in anything pretentious. She was wonderfully, wickedly witty. She made fun of everything, but she was never cruel."         There were no immediate survivors.       
         Gillian Barr Rudd, who ran a marketing firm and was a leader in national efforts to foster business ownership by women, died on Tuesday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 49 years old and lived in Washington.         She died of ovarian cancer, her company said.         Ms. Rudd was the president of the Rudd Company, a publications and marketing company in Washington.

The act created the National Women's Business Council to promote businesswomen's access to contracts, purchase orders, credit, statistics and managerial and technical assistance.         Born in Forest of Dean in England, Ms. Rudd grew up there and in Sri Lanka. She emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her husband, T. James Rudd. She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.         Ms. Rudd was divorced. She is survived by her mother, Alma Lewis of Gloucestershire, England, and a brother, Frank Barr of Victoria, British Columbia.       
         Marjorie Severyns Ravenholt, an expert on Asia for government, news and non-profit organizations, died on Monday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 71 years old.         She died of complications after surgery for lung cancer, said her husband, Albert. The couple lived in Seattle and in Manila.         Mrs. Ravenholt's Asian ties began when she was an exchange student in Japan, Korea and Manchuria. In World War II, she served in India and China as an intelligence agent for the United States Office of Strategic Services, then became a correspondent in China for Life magazine.         She served as an analyst for a United States economic mission to China and later was director of education and information for the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which modernized much of Taiwan. Public Service Awards         For 30 years, Mrs. Ravenholt also helped run the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, financed by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, to honor Asians for public service and other achievement.         She was born in Sunnyside, Wash., graduated from the University of Washington and studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University. She worked briefly for the United States Board of Economic Warfare at the beginning of World War II.         She and her husband were among seven veteran journalists who returned to China in 1985 at the invitation of the Government.         Mr. Ravenholt is the only immediate survivor.       
         Theodora Wiesner, the former director of the American Dance Festival and of the dance division of Brooklyn College, died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 83 years old.         She died of cancer, said her brother, Alwin, of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.         Dr. Wiesner, who was born in Rice Lake, Wis., was a physical-education major at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when she discovered the university's dance program. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 1930, she did graduate work in dance and physical education at New York University.         Dr. Wiesner taught dance before World War II at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. She served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Women's Reserve during the war and was director of emplacement for the Waves in San Diego.

         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. June Louin-Tapp, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development, died last Thursday in Osnabruck, Germany, while there for a two-month stay as a visiting professor at the University of Osnabruck. Dr. Louin-Tapp, a resident of Minneapolis, was 62 years old.         She died suddenly after a brief illness, said Richard Weinberg, director of the institute.         She taught and did research at the University of Chicago from 1964 to 1972, when she joined the Minnesota faculty. Her principal work concerned children's and adults' understanding of rules and laws.         She is survived by two daughters, Mara Tapp of Chicago and Kami Olsson-Tapp of San Diego, and four grandchildren.

         Dr. Maria Victoria Roque Cohen, who practiced internal medicine in the Bronx for 30 years, died on Monday at her home in Harrison, N.Y.         She was 61 years old. Her family said she died of breast cancer.         A native of Argentina, Dr. Roque Cohen came to the United States after her graduation from the National University of Cordoba Medical School. She and her husband, Dr. Sol Cohen, shared a private practice in Co-Op City. She was also an attending physician at Montefiore and Misericordia medical centers.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Roque Cohen is survived by two daughters, Michele and Jennifer, both of Harrison, and a brother, Alfredo of Cordoba.       
         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Alta Jablow, professor emeritus of anthropology at Brooklyn College, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was was 72 years old.         Professor Jablow died of natural causes, said her daughter, Lisa Jablow.         Professor Jablow took particular interest in how societies used folk tales to pass their histories and customs from one generation to the next. She was the author or co-author of six books on Africa and African folk tales and of children's books. She also examined the role of women in different societies.         One of her books, "The Africa That Never Was," which was written with a Brooklyn College colleague, Dorothy Hammond, examined the British experience in Africa and was published by Twain Press in 1970. Another was "Yes and No: The Intimate Folklore on Africa," which was published in 1961 by Horizon Press.         Her interest in folklore sprang from her early interest in dance as a form of telling folk tales. In the 1940's, she was a member of the Martha Graham dance company.         Born in Weehawken, N.J., Professor Jablow earned a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1940 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1963.         She joined the Brooklyn College faculty, where her husband was also on the anthropology faculty, in 1947 as an adjunct professor and became a full-time faculty member in 1965. She retired in 1980.         Professor Jablow is survived by her husband, Joseph, and her daughter, Lisa, also of Manhattan.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died yesterday afternoon at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said. "I think it was probably the effects of the disease coupled with the fact that she was 83 years old," Ms. Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminisences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues.         While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor.         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me":         "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century."         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong docummentary by a California filmmaker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominently Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, she was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' " Lessons From the Family Cook         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer.         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers, while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may was well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941. Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         In 1943, she published "The Gastronomical Me," (Duell, Sloan & Pearce) followed by "Here Let Us Feast (Viking) in 1946. Her novel, "Not Now But Now," was published by Viking in 1947. Her translation from French of "The Physiology of Taste" was published in 1949, the same year that "An Alphabet for Gourmets" appeared.         "A Cordiall Water," a slender volume of folk cures, was published by Little, Brown in 1961. Three years later, the same publisher brought out "A Map of Another Town," a reminiscence of the years she spent in Aix-en-Provence. In 1968, Putnam published "With Bold Knife and Fork," and Mrs. Fisher joined Julia Child and Michael Field as consultants to the Time-Life book "The Cooking of Provencal France."         Throughout these decades, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Fried two years later. An Appetite for Writing         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Viking.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991.         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say," she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Margaret Carthy, former president of the College of New Rochelle and dean of its graduate school, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She was known as Mother Mary Peter during her long career as a Roman Catholic college administrator.         She had Alzheimer's disease and died of pneumonia, said Sister Eileen Fane, prioress of the Convent of St. Teresa, an Ursuline community in New Rochelle.         Sister Margaret was born and raised in Manhattan and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1933. She worked for several years in the business office at Teachers College at Columbia University but, after taking her vows in the Order of St. Ursuline in 1939, she returned to New Rochelle to teach at the Ursuline School. A Former Dean         Sister Margaret began her years in the administration at the College of New Rochelle as assistant registrar in 1941 and served as dean of the college from 1950 to 1957 and then as president until 1961. She earned a master's and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in American church history at Catholic University in Washington.         She added a master's degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and worked for four years as staff editor of The New Catholic Encyclopedia while also lecturing at Catholic University. She then taught at the University of Maryland, becoming assistant director of the general ecducation program and then assistant dean of graduate studies.         In 1975, she returned to her alma mater to accept the post of dean of the graduate school, which she held until her retirement in 1979.         Both before and after her retirement, Sister Margaret wrote articles and books about American church history, including "Catholicism in English-Speaking Lands" (Hawthorn Books, 1964). Much of her writing focused on the Archdiocese of New York, including "A Cathedral of Suitable Magnificence" (St. Patrick's, 1984). In addition, she served as archivist for the Eastern Province of the Ursulines.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Connolly of Jericho, L.I., and many nieces and nephews.       
         Deborah R. Linfield, a senior litigation attorney for The New York Times Company, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her family said Ms. Linfield, who had never smoked, died of lung cancer, which was diagnosed 19 months ago. She had recently been accepted into a research treatment program conducted by the National Institutes of Health at the Garden State Cancer Center in Newark and had been there last week for an initial treatment with radiated monoclonal antibodies.         Ms. Linfield, a 1978 graduate of the New York University School of Law, where she was awarded the American College of Trial Lawyers Medal for Excellence in Advocacy, had been a litigation associate at Willkie Farr & Gallagher for two years and then at Baer Marks & Upham for seven years before joining the Times Company in 1987. She received a Bachelor of Science with honor in psychology from Tufts University. First Amendment Cases         At the Times Company, Ms. Linfield was active in a number of areas of litigation, but her specialty was First Amendment cases involving the press's right of access to court proceedings. She successfully argued for The Times in broadening access rights in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the prosecution of Mario Biaggi, and in New York State's Appellate Division for both the Howard Beach racial-attack case and Joel B. Steinberg child-brutality case.         She was an active member of the City Bar Association and served on both the Committee on Communication Law and the Committee on Women in the Profession.         Ms. Linfield is survived by her 9-year-old daughter, Sarah Linfield Mattingly; by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan L. Linfield of Brooklyn, and by her sister, Susan Linfield of Manhattan.

But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me": "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking?

'On the Outside Looking In'         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F.

Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."

The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941:         "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it." Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         She saw little room at the table for caution. In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters.

A Delicious Meal Of a Bookish Kind         Here are nine of the better-known books written by M.F.K. Fisher over the course of six decades. She wrote a total of 15.         "The Gastronomical Me" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1943), collected essays.         "Here Let Us Feast (Viking, 1946), collected essays.         "Not Now But Now" (Viking, 1947), a novel.         "An Alphabet for Gourmets" (Viking, 1949), collected essays.         "The Physiology of Taste," (Heritage Press, 1949) an English translation of Brillat-Savarin's treatise.         "A Cordiall Water," (Little, Brown, 1961), folk cures.         "A Map of Another Town," (Little, Brown, 1964), reminiscence of years in Aix-en-Provence.         "With Bold Knife and Fork," (Putnam, 1968), collected essays.         "The Cooking of Provencal France," (Time-Life, 1968); Mrs. Fisher served as a consultant with Julia Child and Michael Field.       
         Yoshiko Uchida, a writer of children's books about the Japanese-American experience, died on Sunday at the Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 70 years old and lived in Berkeley.         She died after a stroke, said her literary agent, Barbara Kouts.         Ms. Uchida wrote 29 books from 1949 to 1991. They included 27 books for children, a volume of memoirs "Desert Exile: the Uprooting of a Japanese-American Family," which the University of Washington Press published in 1982, and "The Invisible Thread," an autobiography written for teen-agers and published by Julian Messner in 1991.         "The graceful and lively books of Yoshiko Uchida have drawn on the author's own childhood to document the Japanese-American experience" in fiction for her young audience, Patty Campbell wrote in a review of Ms. Uchida's "Happiest Ending" (Atheneum, 1985) in The New York Times Book Review.         She was born in Alameda, Calif., to parents who were both born and educated in Japan and then immigrated to California early this century. She was reared in Berkeley and received a B.A.  degree from the University of California at Berkeley and a master's degree in education from Smith College.         She is survived by a sister, Keiko Kakutani, who lives outside New Haven.       
         Rebecca C. Simonson, a New York City schoolteacher active in school affairs in the 1940's and 1950's, died on Sunday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Peekskill, N.Y.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her son, David C. Simonson.         Mrs. Simonson, a native of Brooklyn and a graduate of the Columbia University teacher training program, taught sixth grade at Public School 61 in the Bronx for most of her 35-year teaching career. From 1940 to 1952, she was president of the Teachers Guild, which preceded the United Federation of Teachers.         Her husband, Simon, died in 1943.         She is survived by her son, David, of Arlington, Va.; a brother, Sidney, of Norwalk, Conn.; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Cohen Sherman, a Connecticut businesswoman, died on May 31 at Norwalk Hospital. She was 68 and lived in Westport.         Mrs. Sherman died of complications from breast cancer, said her son, Robert Cohen.         Mrs. Sherman was president of Airpot, which makes a pneumatic device of that name used to control the motion of parts in photocopiers, computers and other technological equipment. Mrs. Sherman took charge of the company when her first husband, Arthur Cohen, who founded it, died in 1974.         In 1980 Mrs. Sherman was appointed to the White House Conference on Small Business, and in 1982 she became the first Connecticut woman to receive the National Award for Small Business Person from the United States Business Administration.         Mr. Sherman was born in Charleston, W.Va. She graduated from the National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington in 1938 and from Mount Holyoke College in 1942. She interrupted her graduate studies at Columbia University in the mid-1940's to marry Mr. Cohen, who died in 1974.         In addition to her son, who lives in Philadelphia, Mrs. Sherman is survived by her second husband, Melvin Sherman, a daughter, Barbara Cohen Stanley, of San Francisco, a brother Stanley Silverstein, of Charleston, W.Va., and five grandchildren.       
         Carole Mills Weinberg, a modeling agent and executive, died on Thursday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 49 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.         She was in Little Rock for treatment for cancer at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Center, her husband said.         Mrs. Weinberg was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to the United States with her family. After attending Northwestern University, she began modeling in Chicago and then taught modeling there.         Moving to New York City in the 1960's, she worked as an agent for the Sanford Leigh modeling agency, then became director of the television division of the Ford modeling agency and later director of the casting department at the Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn advertising company. She specialized in television commercials.         She and her husband, William P. Weinberg, became half-owners of Wilhelmina International Limited, the parent company of the Wilhelmina Artists and Wilhelmina Models. He was president of the Wilhelmina organizations, and she was on the board of directors. They sold their share in the company two years ago but remained as consultants for special projects.         Her survivors include her husband and her parents, Adam and Greta Boyce of Mount Prospect, Ill.       
         Sherry Goldman Abel, a retired managing editor of Commentary magazine, died on May 28 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She had suffered from a stroke and respiratory illness, friends said.         Mrs. Abel was born in Chicago and graduated from the University of Chicago. She held a variety of editorial jobs, including compiling a Yiddish encyclopedia, editing a book on cinema and working at Time magazine.         She joined Commentary about 1950 as an editorial assistant and eventually rose to managing editor. She retired in the 1960's.         Her marriages to William McKenzie and Lionel Abel, a playwright and author, ended in divorce. Her daughter, Merry, died in 1964.         Mrs. Abel is survived by a brother, Jack Goldman of Chicago.       
         Dr. Joanna Hollenberg Sher, a professor of clinical pathology at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn, died on July 4 at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 59 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Sher died of cancer, said her son, Jonathan.         Dr. Sher, who earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1952 and a medical degree from its school of medicine in 1956, was an authority on neuropathology. She published more than 60 papers and more than 40 abstracts of speeches on the human brain. With Dr. Richard Lectenberg, Dr. Sher was co-editor of a book, "AIDS in the Nervous System," published in 1988 by Churchill-Livingstone.         She joined the faculty of the SUNY Health Science Center as an instructor in 1962 and was named full professor in 1977. In 1987 she was named a distinguished service professor.         Dr. Sher was also chief of the Neuropathology Laboratory at the Kings County Hopsital Center in Brooklyn and an attending physician at other hospitals in New York City.         Dr. Sher, born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was a naturalized United States citizen.         In addition to her son, Jonathan, of Philadelphia, she is survived by her husband, Dr. Norman Sher; a daughter, Katherine, of San Francisco, and a brother, Dr. Robert Hollenberg, of Hamilton, Ontario.       
         Debora Dammann Kramer, an administrator of mental health and social-welfare programs, died on Saturday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Mrs. Kramer was 54 years old and lived in Washington and in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a member of the family said.         Mrs. Kramer, after graduating from Radcliffe College, began her career in health care in the 1960's at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in Washington. She later headed nonprofit organizations devoted to helping children. She was executive director of the American Association of Psychiatric Services for Children from 1972 to 1979, which was based in Washington but moved in 1988 to Rochester.         From 1985 to 1987, Mrs. Kramer was executive director of the Committee for Food and Shelter in Washington, an advocacy group for the homeless, and a forerunner of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.         She was divorced from John R. Kramer in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Philadelphia, and Daniel, of Manhattan; two sisters, Penelope Johnston of Riverside, Conn., and Pamela Adams of Lexington, Me., and a grandson.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Mabel Randall Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in the creation of its programs to help troubled children, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness, her family said.         Miss Thomas served as the first full-time executive director of the organization, from 1952 until her retirement about 25 years later. Big Sisters eventually merged with the Big Brothers organization.         During her tenure, Big Sisters built a staff of social workers, psychologists and other professionals and opened offices in courts across the city to help neglected, delinquent or otherwise troubled youngsters. The annual caseload jumped from a relative handful to thousands. Her efforts won awards from the City Bar Association in New York and Community Trust.         Miss Thomas was born in Montgomery, Ala. She graduated from the University of Alabama in 1939. During World War II she worked on the staff of the U.S.O. at Fort McClellan, Ala., and later for the Red Cross. She resumed her studies at Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree in social work in 1952.         She is survived by two brothers, William of Montgomery and Walton of Milwaukee, and three sisters, Jean Walker of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Anna Atherton and Ethel Golson, both of Montgomery.         Correction:  July 21, 1992, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Mabel R. Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in helping troubled children, referred incorrectly to the status of the organization. It is independent, and separate from Big Brothers.       
         Olga Loeb, a trustee of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center who did volunteer work for more than five decades, died on Sunday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 97 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Loeb managed her gift shop at the hospital on Friday as usual and died at Northern Dutchess Hospital of complications after an asthma attack, said a hospital spokesman. She was on a family visit when she became ill.         She was a native of Vienna who moved to the Bronx in 1911.         As a girl, she collected pennies for a new dispensary that became a forerunner of the hospital that her future husband helped to found in 1927 -- Bronx-Lebanon on the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section. A Buyer for Store Chains         She studied at Syracuse University and then built a successful career buying merchandise for department-store chains. She returned to the Bronx at the age of 40 and married Dr. Martin J. Loeb, a surgeon and philanthropist.         Mrs. Loeb became active in the hospital's Ladies' Auxiliary in 1942 and had been its president since 1953. She also served as an officer or head of various hospital committees as well as the Comprehensive Planning Board for her local health district.         After her husband's death in 1961, Mrs. Loeb persuaded the hospital board to convert part of a waiting room into a gift shop that she would run with a few volunteers. It sells flowers and teddy bears among other things and has raised more than $1 million for the hospital. Mrs. Loeb herself opened the shop every weekday at 7:30 A.M. and closed it at 5 P.M.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         May Rudin, philanthropist and matriarch of one of Manhattan's real-estate dynasties, died yesterday at her East Side home. She was 95 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         A native of New York City, she was one of seven children born to immigrant parents. May Cohen dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and enrolled in a business school to study typing, stenography, bookkeeping and commercial law. She then went to work as a bookkeeper.         In 1923, she married Samuel Rudin, who four years later founded Rudin Management, realtors and builders, whose holdings now comprise dozens of tall buildings. The buildings, assembled over 60 years, were valued at $1.5 billion by analysts two years ago.         When Mr. Rudin died in 1975, his will established the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, of which Mrs. Rudin was the chairwoman at her death. Well into her 90's, she played an active part in its disbursements, which at last count, in 1990, came to 222 grants totaling $5.3 million. Sponsors of the Marathon         The foundation primarily supported education, social and religious welfare agencies, hospitals and health associations as well as museums and the performing arts. The money was spent mostly in Manhattan, where the Rudins' assets are concentrated.         The Rudins also were the first business sponsors of the New York City Marathon. From its inauguration in 1976 until 1990, May Rudin waited at the finish line each year to present the Samuel Rudin Trophy to the man and woman who broke the tape. Her husband, she noted, was keen on long-distance running well before it became fashionable.         Foundation beneficiaries included St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing, AIDS-related programs, Phoenix House and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center to public-school children, Lincoln Center and New York University, where the foundation endowed a chair in the humanities.         Mrs. Rudin is survived by her sons Jack and Lewis, respectively the chairman and the president of the family business, both residents of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Helen M. Knubel, archivist of the Lutheran Church, died on Thursday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91 years old. She lived in New Rochelle, N.Y., until she recently entered the Wartburg Nursing Home, in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Miss Knubel died of respiratory failure, said her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel.         Miss Knubel was considered the foremost archivist of the history of the Lutheran Church in North America. She helped to gather and maintain records of the earliest settlements of Lutherans in the United States and Canada and organized the library and archives of the National Lutheran Council, which coordinated the service work of more than 30 Lutheran groups.         From 1954 to 1966 she was secretary of research and statistics of the National Lutheran Council. From 1967 to her retirement in 1971, she was associate director of the Office of Research, Statistics and Archives to the council's successor, the Lutheran Council in the U.S.A. She also founded and directed the Oral History of Cooperative Lutheranism in America.         Miss Knubel was born in New York City. Her father, Frederick H. Knubel, was president of the United Church in America, from its founding in 1918 to 1944. Her brother, Frederick R. Knubel, was president of the United Lutheran Synod of New York and New England from 1945 to 1957.         Miss Knubel's formal schooling was interrupted at age 15, when she was struck by polio, which forced her to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She studied at the New School for Social Research; the Biblical Seminary of New York, the predecessor to the New York Theological Seminary, and the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Among many honors, Miss Knubel was awarded the Distinguished Disciple Award of the Metropolitan New York Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.         In addition to her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel, of Manhattan, she is survived by a niece, Helen Perry, of Milford, N.J.       
         Jean Baer Fensterheim, a writer of personal self-help books and magazine articles aimed especially at women, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Herbert Fensterheim.         A native of Chicago and a 1944 graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Baer scored her first success as an author in 1965 when Macmillan began "Follow Me!," a travel guide for single women looking for a husband abroad. At the time, she was single and the publicity director for Seventeen magazine. The book grew from her experiences during more than a dozen trips to Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.         This was followed in 1968 by "The Single Girl Goes to Town" (Macmillan). Months after its publication, she married Dr. Fensterheim, a clinical psychologist who also became her co-author. Together, they focused on psychological writings.         Their latest book was "Making Life Right When It Feels All Wrong" (Macmillan, 1988).         Outside the genre, Ms. Baer wrote "The Self-Chosen" (Arbor House, 1982), a book about what she called "the world of the Jewish elite" in the United States since World War II.         She was the secretary of the Overseas Press Club and served on its board of directors.         Ms. Baer is survived, in addition to Dr. Fensterheim, by a sister, Carol Norr of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, Robert Baer of Woodstock, N.Y.       
         Willa L. Z. Armstrong, the president of Armstrong Information Services, a Manhattan video-production company, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center. She was 63 years old and had homes in Manhattan and at Ocean Ridge on Fire Island, L.I.         She died of cancer, said a friend, Helen L. Horwitz.         Mrs. Armstrong won many industry awards for her films, which included a range of educational and informational videos, public-service announcements and video-news releases. Several of her productions, including "Screen Printing: An American Art Form" and "Drive to Win," about four-in-hand equestrian driving, were broadcast on public television.         She was born in Manhattan and reared in Brooklyn. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College. Before founding her company in 1979, she was a vice president of Planned Communications Services, a corporate-video production company. She was a member of Women Executives in Public Relations and New York Women in Film.         She is survived by a brother, Walter Zanger of Jerusalem, and a stepson, Grattan V. Armstrong of East Hampton, L.I.       
         Alberta Smith Jacoby, a film maker and lecturer on mental health, died on Wednesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jacoby, a specialist in mental-health education, had been a member of the faculty of Yale University for the last 25 years and remained a lecturer on public health at the time of her death. She taught and produced documentaries at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, a part of the Yale School of Medicine.         She was born in Worthington, Minn., was an alternate on the 1928 Olympic diving team and became a champion golfer. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota and received a master's degree in public health from Yale in 1967, the year she joined the faculty.         She began to show films on health during World War II as a program director for the Office of War Information, an information officer at the Public Health Service and, finally, chief of information for the National Institute of Mental Health.         She went into film making herself in 1949, when she and her director-husband, the late Irving A. Jacoby, formed the Mental Health Film Board. A production company, it made more than 100 documentaries, some of which won awards, on subjects such as psychiatric illnesses, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and hospice care.         At Yale, she taught a course entitled Health Communications. With her assistance, student crews made films about local health agencies to educate the public about what the agencies did.         Mr. Jacoby died in 1985. She is survived by six children, Clair Haycraft Johnson of Maui, Hawaii, Sara Haycraft Sparrow of North Branford, Conn., Peter Altman of Boston, Leslie Altman Rescoria of Havertown, Pa., Tamar Jacoby of Manhattan, and Oren Jacoby, also of Manhattan; three brothers, Paul Smith of St. David's Island, Bermuda, and Robert and Sidney Smith, both of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Rae Dalven, a translator of modern Greek poets and historian of Greek Jews, died on July 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Friends said she had been in declining health but they did not know the cause of death.         Dr. Dalven was retired as a professor of English literature and department chairwoman at Ladycliff College in Highland Falls, N.Y.         Born in Preveza, Greece, she immigrated to the United States with her family as a youngster. She graduated from Hunter College and earned a doctorate in English at New York University. Translated Greek Poetry         Among her translations was "Modern Greek Poetry" (Gaer, 1949). In a review, W. H. Auden wrote, "we should be very grateful to Miss Dalven for introducing us to a world of poetry which has been closed to us" by the language barrier. Mr. Auden later wrote the introductions to her "The Complete Poems of Cavafy" (Harcourt, Brace, 1961) and "The Fourth Dimension" (Godine, 1977), translating Yannis Ritsos.         Dr. Dalven also wrote two plays, the first of which, "A Season in Hell," about the French poets Rimbaud and Verlaine, was produced Off Broadway in 1950.         Last year she finished "Our Kind of People," an autobiographical play about a family of Greek-Jewish immigrants. It was performed at a synagogue in Manhattan and is scheduled for presentation this fall at a Brooklyn theater and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Manhattan. Studied Greek Jewish Group         Dr. Dalven's special interest was the history of Jews in Greece, especially the community in Ioannina in northern Greece, most of whose members were driven out during World War II. They were Romaniotes, who traced their ancestry to Palestinians and who migrated as early as 300 B.C. They retained their customs and liturgy, which differed from those of the more numerous Sephardim whose ancestors were expelled from Spain.         Dr. Dalven was the editor of "The Sephardic Scholar," a journal; a board member of the American Friends of the Jewish Museum of Greece and a past president of the American Society of Sephardic Studies and of the Sisterhood of Janina, a Romaniote group.         Her marriage to Jack Negrin ended in divorce. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Linda J. Laubenstein, a Manhattan physician who in 1981 discovered some of the first mysterious cases of what became the worldwide AIDS epidemic, died on Saturday at her summer home in Chatham, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 45 years old.         Her family said an autopsy was pending. She suffered from severe asthma and weakness from childhood polio, an illness that required three major operations and left her a paraplegic at the age of 5.         "She is incredibly important in the history of AIDS, a genuine pioneer and a real fighter for what she believed," said Larry Kramer, an author and a leader in AIDS causes.         Dr. Laubenstein inspired the character of Dr. Emma Brookner, a principal role in Mr. Kramer's play on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, "The Normal Heart." He said an agreement was near on the production of a movie version by Barbra Streisand, with Ms. Streisand playing the Laubenstein-Brookner part.         Dr. Jeffrey B. Greene, a colleague, called Dr. Laubenstein "the ultimate AIDS physician." Despite her handicap, she met patients in the emergency room in the middle of the night and even made house calls, using her motorized wheelchair and public buses. "She was sicker than most of her patients but didn't let it stop her," Dr. Greene said. First Paper on Subject         Dr. Laubenstein and Dr. Alvin Friedman-Kien wrote the first paper to be published in a medical journal on the alarming appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma, a previously rare disease of lesions of the skin and other tissues. Most of the cases were in young gay men suffering a puzzling collapse of the immune system.         Recalling one of the first cases, she described a 33-year-old man with two purple spots behind his ears. Initially he responded to the cancer drugs she prescribed. But 18 months later he was dead, his body covered with 75 lesions.         Many more cases followed. By May 1982, she had seen 62 patients with AIDS -- a fourth of the national total recorded at the time. She said then that "this problem certainly is not going away."         Her father, George Laubenstein, said yesterday, "She told us from the very beginning that this is going to be a terrible epidemic."         Dr. Laubenstein's private practice grew to be predominantly AIDS cases. She and Dr. Freidman-Kien arranged the first full-scale medical conference on AIDS, at New York University in 1983. She also help to found the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research Fund in 1983. Jobs in Office Services         In 1989, she and Dr. Greene founded Multitasking, a nonprofit organization selling office services to other businesses and employing people with AIDS as the workers. Her concern was that AIDS patients often lost their jobs and that work was vital to emotional and physical health as well as for financial support.         Dr. Laubenstein was outspoken about what she said was the neglect by government and society in fighting AIDS. Some of her views were controversial among gay groups, particularly her belief that bathhouses should be shut down to discourage unsafe sex.         Born in Boston, she grew up in Barrington, R.I. She graduated from Barnard College and New York University Medical School. Her specialties were hematology and oncology, and she was a clinical professor at the New York University Medical Center.         Surviving are her parents, George and Priscilla of Harwich Port, Mass., and a brother, Peter of Melvin Village, N.H.       
         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Edith R. Peterson, a medical researcher into cell cultures at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Saturday at Horton Memorial Hospital in Middletown, N.Y. She was 78 years old and had moved to Middletown two years ago from the Bronx.         She died of a stroke, said Art Oshins, a spokesman at Albert Einstein.         Ms. Peterson, who was born in Brooklyn, had been associated with the college since 1966. She was known for several innovations in her specialty, organotypic cultures -- cultures typical of an organ -- of nerve and muscle tissues.         The college reported that one important contribution led to the recognition that myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve cells, can be grown in test tubes. The finding, which she made in 1948, aided multiple-sclerosis research, since the destruction of myelin causes that disease, the college said.         Ms. Peterson graduated from Barnard College in 1937 with a major in zoology, and earned an M.A. in that discipline at Columbia University two years later.         Ms. Peterson is survived by her husband, Charles; a son, Wesley; a daughter, Ronnie, and three grandchildren, all of Middletown.       
         Dr. Dorothy Richardson Jones, an author and professor emeritus of English at Queens College died on Friday at Rutland (Vt.) Regional Medical Center. She was 81 years old and lived in Dorset, Vt., and Hollywood, Fla., since her retirement in 1973.         She died of liver cancer, said her companion, Dr. Wyatt D. Jones.         Professor Jones, a native of Flushing, Queens, graduated from Hood College and held a master's degree from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. She was the author of "King of Critics," a biography of George Saintsbury (1845-1933), an English literary critic and historian, published by the University of Michigan Press this month. Going beyond the life of Saintsbury, the book is a portrait of the literary scene of Victorian-Edwardian England.         Professor Jones joined Queens College as an instructor in 1939 and became a full professor in 1970. She spent 33 years on the faculty, including five as head of the English Department and one as a visiting professor of English at the University of Leicester, England.         After her retirement, she became the owner of the Anglophile Antiques shop in Dorset.         Professor Jones is survived by a brother, Dr. Edward R. Richardson of Dallas, and Lake St. Catherine, Vt. Her husband, Prof. Ernest Van B. Jones, died in 1966.

         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Virginia Sale, a character actress whose career in theater, film, radio and television spanned more than four decades, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 93 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Miss Sale was best known for her work in Hollywood, where by her count she played more than 300 supporting roles in films, beginning with silent comedies in 1927 and concluding with "Slither" in 1970.         She also appeared for eight years in the radio serial "Those We Love," and she wrote and starred in "The Wrens' Nest," one of television's first family comedies, which was broadcast by ABC in 1949. She was frequently seen on the Garry Moore and Kate Smith shows and in other television comedies, including "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres."         Miss Sale also won acclaim for her one-woman show, "Americana Sketches," in which she drew upon her upbringing in Urbana, Ill., to explore the foibles and humor of small town-America.         Miss Sale attended the University of Illinois for two years and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her films included the 1930 "Moby Dick," with John Barrymore, and a string of Westerns, including "Badman's Territory" and "Trail Street," with Randolph Scott.         Miss Sale's husband, Sam Wren, an actor and director, died in Hollywood in 1962.         She is survived by a daughter, Virginia Wren Moore of Lake Forest, Ill., and a son, Christopher S. Wren of Manhattan, who is editor of new projects for The New York Times.       
         Karena P. Somerville, the manager of Consolidated Edison's Customer Outreach program, died on Thursday. She was 46 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         Mrs. Somerville died in an automobile accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway near the Orchard Beach exit in the Bronx. Her car struck a tree early Thursday morning in a construction area, the police said.         Mrs. Somerville, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Syracuse University. In 1973 she joined Con Edison's public-affairs department in Westchester. In 1987 she was named director of public affairs for Con Edison's Westchester customer service unit, and in 1990 she was named assistant to the chairman of Consolidated Edison.         Mrs. Somerville is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Kelley; a son, Chad; a twin sister, Tamara Westover, all of Rye, and her father, Paul Buiar of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Dr. LaDonne H. Schulman, a prominent researcher in advanced genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 56 years old.         The college said the cause of death was cancer.         Dr. Schulman, a professor of developmental biology and cancer, was known for her work with transfer RNA, or tRNA -- molecules that complete the process of synthesizing proteins according to the DNA code. Before their discovery, Francis Crick, the Nobelist and a discoverer of DNA, had foreseen their existence as the "bilingual molecules" that understand the chemical languages of DNA and protein.         As it turned out, each tRNA molecule bears one amino acid that it ultimately inserts into the growing protein at the proper location, as prescribed by the DNA sequence. Dr. Schulman's particular interest lay in the process of recognition by which tRNAs came to carry the correct amino acids.         The hospital said she helped to demonstrate that enzymes rely on a particular section of the tRNA molecule -- the anticodon -- to match the right amino acids with their tRNA carriers. In the process, she found ways to test tRNA activity and showed why all proteins start with the same amino acid, methionine.         LaDonne Heaton Schulman was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and graduated summa cum laude from Wheaton College before spending a year as a Fulbright scholar at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. She received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry at Columbia University and did postdoctoral studies at New York University Medical Center in 1966.         She joined Albert Einstein as an assistant professor in the Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer in 1968 and became a full professor 10 years later.         Dr. Schulman is survived by her brother, Cherrill Paul Heaton of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Dr. Evelyn B. Man, a biochemist who helped develop the first widely used test to detect low hormone levels in the thyroid gland, which enabled treatment to prevent mental retardation, died on Sept. 3 at her home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer, a funeral home spokesman said.         "She was one of the top authorities in the world on thyroid," said Dr. Philip K. Bondy, the retired chairman of the department of medicine at Yale, where she did most of her work.         Her efforts won the American Thyroid Association's Distinguished Service Award and the United Cerebral Palsy Award for Research.         Dr. Man was a full-time researcher and educator in biochemistry for more than 40 years. In the 1930's she worked with John P. Peters and Herman Yannet to develop the first practical test for thyroid levels.         The procedure, the protein bound iodine test, and a later version called the butanol extractable iodine test, enabled the identification of people with abnormal thyroid functions. High thyroid levels, if untreated, can be fatal. Low thyroid levels cause cretinism, but that is reversible with thyroid supplements.         Early surveys using the test showed that low hormone levels in the thyroid gland were the leading cause of preventable retardation. Many institutionalized patients were found to have been misdiagnosed as demented and were restored to normal functioning with thyroid medication.         Later thyroid tests, developed by other scientists, are now used to screen all newborns in developed countries.         Dr. Man also studied the effect of nuclear radiation on thyroid functioning in survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan in World War II.         Dr. Man was born in Lawrence, L.I. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1925 and earned a doctorate in physiological chemistry at Yale in 1932.         She worked variously as a technician, researcher and professor at Yale from 1928 to 1961, then worked nine years at Brown University.         Although she retired from full-time work in 1970, she continued her studies. She published 156 scientific papers over a period of about 60 years, the last in 1991.         For much of her life Dr. Man lived in North Stonington, Conn., where she was an officer in the North Stonington Historical Society. She was also active in the local hospital and library in Westerly, R.I.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Harriet W. Sheridan, former undergraduate dean at Brown University, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 67 years old and lived in Barrington, R.I.         The cause of death was cancer, said Don DeMaio, a Brown spokesman.         Professor Sheridan was hired as dean at Brown in 1979 and remained in the post until 1987, when she resigned to return to her longtime career, the teaching of English. She later founded the Center for the Advancement of College Teaching at the university and was noted for her course on literature and medicine, which proved popular with many medical students.         She had arrived at Brown from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she had spent 26 years and had served at various times as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, chairwoman of the English department and faculty chairwoman. She was also Carleton's acting president from January to August of 1977, succeeding Howard Swearer, who had resigned to become president at Brown.         A native of Manhattan, she received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from Smith College in 1945 and a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1950.         Professor Sheridan was chairwoman of the American Association for Higher Education and a member of many educational groups, including the American Council on Education's Commission on Women in Higher Education. She was a former director of the Association of American Colleges and a former member of the Commission on Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.         She is survived by her husband, Philip; two daughters, Alison Buffum of Narrangansett, R.I., and Roo Sheridan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
         Helen A. Wilson, a retired executive for international refugee and development agencies, died Friday at her house in Washington. She was 79 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, said Marion Connell, a colleague and friend.         Reared in the Brooklyn Heights section of Brooklyn, Miss Wilson graduated from Barnard College and earned a master's degree from the Fordham University School of Social Work. She then worked for adoption and foster-care agencies in New York City before joining the International Social Service, which works to reunite families separated by war.         After World War II, the United Nations' Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Administration sent Miss Wilson to Algeria and Italy, where she lived in the refugee camps she administered. After holding various positions with international agencies in Switzerland and North Africa, she joined the Peace Corps when it was founded, serving as deputy director of program development and coordination and later becoming acting director of private and international organizations.         In 1965, she joined the United States Agency for International Development, filling a number of posts before her retirement in 1977.         Miss Wilson leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Mary Wells Ashworth, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, died on Saturday at the Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Va. She was 89 years old and lived in Richmond.         Mrs. Ashworth died of a ruptured aorta, said her son, Osbourne Orlando Ashworth Jr. of Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Ashworth grew up in Florida and moved to Virginia with her family as a teen-ager. She graduated from Hollins College in Hollins, Va., in 1924, and later served on the college's board.         For many years, Mrs. Ashworth was a research associate of the historian Douglas Southall Freeman, the author of a multi-volume biography of George Washington. After Professor Freeman died in 1953, she and another research associate, John A. Carroll, wrote the seventh and final volume of Freeman's authoritative "George Washington, a Biography" published by Scribner's in 1957. The entire work won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1958 and Columbia University's Loubat Prize the same year.         Mrs. Ashworth also contributed to the World Book Encyclopedia and to the compendium "Notable American Women 1607-1950."         Mrs. Ashworth's husband, Dr. Osbourne O. Ashworth, a physician, died in 1945. In addition to her son Osbourne, Mrs. Ashworth is survived by another son, Dr. John Sheriden Ashworth of Richmond.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Judith N. Shklar, a professor of government at Harvard University, died Wednesday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 63 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of a heart attack, said Ariadne Valsamis, a Harvard University spokeswoman.         Professor Shklar specialized in 18th, 19th, and 20th century political and intellectual theory. From 1989 to 1990 she was president of the American Political Science Association, the first woman to head the nation's largest professional organization of political scientists.         In 1984 she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for exceptionally talented individuals.         In 1985 she was awarded the teaching prize of the Harvard University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Its citation described her as "demanding, rewarding, forthright, fair, and reasonable, a model of intellectual and human qualities rarely combined."         Born in Riga, Latvia, Professor Shklar emigrated with her family first to Sweden and then in 1941 to Canada. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill University and a doctorate in 1955 from Radcliffe College. She taught at Harvard since 1956.         Professor Shklar is survived by her husband, Gerald Shklar, a professor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine; two sons, David, of Cambridge, and Michael, of Leminister, N.H., and a daughter, Ruth, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Dorothy Disney MacKaye, who chronicled marital woes and dispensed advice for 30 years through a column in The Ladies' Home Journal, "Can This Marriage Be Saved?", died on Saturday at her summer home in Guilford, Conn. She was 88 years old and lived in Guilford and Washington.         She died of a heart attack, said her son, William R. MacKaye of Washington.         Mrs. MacKaye, who wrote under the byline Dorothy Cameron Disney, was something of a pioneer both as an advice columnist and a marriage counselor, and for generations of readers her column -- entertaining, occasionally titillating, sometimes a little pedantic -- served as a spyglass into the lives of anonymous strangers.         The column, which first appeared in January 1953, continues today. In Mrs. MacKaye's hands it was devoted each month to the travails of a married couple. Based on interviews and then written largely in dialogue, as if in the voices of the troubled partners, the columns dealt with issues like jealousy, infidelity, money problems and, increasingly as time went on and moral strictures relaxed, sexual problems.         "The columns seem to represent a chronicle of the many changes in the institution of marriage -- and the fascination it holds," Mrs. MacKaye said in a retrospective essay written for the 100th anniversary issue of The Ladies' Home Journal in January 1984. Looking back on her three decades as a columnist, she concluded that of all marital problems, "the single greatest pitfall of all times" is the inability of husband and wife to communicate. " 'He (or she) never listens' is universal," she wrote.         By the time she began her career as a columnist, she was the author of nine mystery novels, and she believed she was successful as a columnist, her son said in an interview, because of her training as a storyteller. Her technique, he said, was to take her prospective subject couple out to dinner to prime and cajole them and then afterward to speak with them separately. She would also interview their marriage counselor.         In the column, the names were never divulged and identifying details were not provided. "She would always tell the couples that unless they told their friends they'd never be recognized," her son said. "Those people who told their friends were invariably recognized -- and embarrassed."         In the beginning, the column was a collaboration between Mrs. MacKaye and Dr. Paul Popenoe, the founder of the American Institute of Family Relations, a marriage counseling agency in Hollywood. Dr. Popenoe put her in touch with his patients, who then became her subjects. Later on, as the column became more well known, Mrs. MacKaye made it entirely her own, calling on counseling agencies across the country for source material.         Mrs. MacKaye was born in 1904 in Atoka, Indian Territory, part of what became the State of Oklahoma in 1907, and grew up in Muskogee. Her father, Loren G. Disney, was a lawyer and a local political figure. She attended several colleges, including George Washington University and Barnard College, but never graduated. Her son said her explanation for this was that she refused to take any science courses.         Mrs. MacKaye's marriage to Milton MacKaye, a magazine writer, endured for 50 years until his death in 1979.         In her addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter-in-law, Mary Anne MacKaye, and five grandchildren.       
         Patricia Phipps Buckley, a psychotherapist practicing in Manhattan and Queens, died in an accident on Aug. 30 in Southington, Conn. She was 61 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         A police report said she died of multiple injuries received in a fall while on a hiking trip.         Ms. Buckley, a native of Rockville Center, L.I., graduated in nursing and psychology from Adelphi University. She held an M.S. degree in counseling and psychology from Miami University and did postgraduate work in vocational rehabilitation and psychology at Columbia University.         She was a former director of the Manhattan Center for the Living, a voluntary nonprofit organization for people with chronic illnesses. She was also a member of the board of directors for Unicef in New York.         In addition to her practice, Ms. Buckley was involved with Catholic Charities, making home visits to care for patients terminally ill with AIDS-related diseases. She was also an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.         Ms. Buckley is survived by her son, Thomas L. Thron of San Francisco, and her fiance, Herbert Boyer of Manhattan.       
         Gladys Merrifield, a poet and editor, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Gail Merrifield Papp.         Mrs. Merrifield, a native of Colton, Calif., received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley, where she was awarded the Chamberlain Cook Prize in poetry, and did graduate studies at Columbia University. She was a staff writer and editor at Family Circle magazine from 1952 until the early 70's.         She published two volumes of poetry, "20th Reunion" (1984) and "Windows on Manhattan" (1986). Her work appeared in many poetry magazines and in two anthologies, "The Diamond Anthology" (1971) and "The View From the Top of the Mountain" (1982). In 1982, a selection of her work was read by Ruth Nelson as part of the Poets at the Public series at the Public Theater in New York City.         For her long narrative poem "The Roundabout Cafe: Manhattan," which formed part of "Windows on Manhattan," Mrs. Merrifield received the Robert Browning Award from the Robert Browning Society and the Mason Sonnet Award from the World Order of Narrative Poets.         Mrs. Merrifield's only survivor is her daughter, the widow of Joseph Papp, who founded the Public Theater.       
         Natalie deWolf Paine, a television production administrator at CBS News and at the Columbia University Seminars on Media and Society, died on Wednesday. She was 62 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.         Mrs. Paine's death was reported by her husband, Kenneth Paine, who said she died of cancer at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.         Mrs. Paine joined CBS News as a staff administrator in 1951 and served as staff administrator for the "See It Now" and "CBS Reports" programs, with Edward R. Murrow reporting and Fred W. Friendly producing.         Mr. Friendly described Mrs. Paine yesterday as "a central link, our gyroscope" in coordinating production and information gathering.         She resigned from CBS in 1964 to raise a family. In 1982 she rejoined Mr. Friendly, who was directing Columbia University's seminars on the media and society and helped to produce more than 600 of them.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Jenifer, of Boston; two stepdaughters, Emily Paine of Los Angeles and Rachel Wilson of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Janet Viertel, an underwater photographer, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. She was 77 years old and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Newark, she attended public schools and the School of Dramatic Art, New York University. She married Joseph Viertel and lived in Stamford, Conn., where she took part in civic activities. She became water resources chairman of the Connecticut State Board of the League of Women Voters, which awakened her interest in the coastal waters and oceans.         At the age of 50, when her children had grown up, she decided to become an underwater photographer, learned to dive and moved to St. Croix with her husband. The results were three books published by Grosset & Dunlap: "Undersea Gardens of the Virgin Islands" (1969); "Blue Planet, the Ecology of the Oceans" (1973), intended for high-school students, and "Underwater Holidays" (1978), a diving-and-snorkeling guide.         Her work was exhibited in one-woman shows at the Eastman Kodak galleries and at Grand Central Terminal in New York and at colleges and galleries around the country. She showed her work on television talk shows.         She always maintained a sense of humor about her work. Asked by a television interviewer which she enjoyed more, the scuba diving or photography, she replied: "The part I like best is when I come back to the surface and have a gin and tonic."         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Viertel is survived by a daughter, Alice Krieger of Manhattan; two sons, Tom of Manhattan, and Jack of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Joy Golden of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party. But when you've read the stories, your next party might may seem to you as if Laurie Colwin had written it."         Ms. Colwin's four novels were "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 1990), "Family Happiness" (Knopf, 1982), "Happy All the Time" (Knopf, 1978) and "Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object" (Viking, 1975). A Focus on Food         Her three collections of short stories were "Another Marvelous Thing" (Knopf, 1986), "The Lone Pilgrim" (Knopf, 1981) and "Passage and Affect" (Viking, 1974). Some of her work was adapted for stage and television.         She also worked as a translator for Isaac Bashevis Singer and wrote for The New Yorker, Mademoiselle and Redbook.         In 1987 Ms. Colwin won a Guggenheim fellowship.         Food was also a focus of her life.  During the campus uprisings at Columbia University in 1968, she cooked forstudent protesters occupying buildings. Later she was a volunteer and a cook for the Coalition for the Homeless and the Antonio Olivieri Shelter for Homeless Women.         She was also a food columnist for Gourmet magazine and wrote two volumes of essays and recipes, "Home Cooking" (Knopf, 1988) and "More Home Cooking" (HarperCollins, 1990).         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton.  Then she began trying her own hand at writing and sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of the Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.

She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.       
         Edith Sable, a longtime civic leader who fostered voter participation and recruited public officials and business leaders to debate New York City's problems and future, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         For four decades Mrs. Sable was a League of Women Voters volunteer and officer. She was the economic development director of its New York chapter and was also on the national board.         She focused on the city's government structure, financing and management, as well as its economy. In the city and state fiscal crises in the 1970's, she convened seminars for officials and others to learn about and discuss finances and charter reform.         "Edith's meetings were one of the best sources of background information," said Elizabeth Cooke, then a municipal union lobbyist and now president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. "Personal and political agendas were pretty much put aside, and thoughtful people struggled with difficult issues." Published 'They Represent You'         Mrs. Sable's later conferences examined city management in 1979, the capital budget process in 1981, infrastructure in 1983, public authorities in 1985 and contract procedures in 1989. She also organized sessions on the city's economy with officials, executives and economists speaking and touring sites from the Fresh Kills landfill to the Hunts Point market.         She started the league's popular reference booklet "They Represent You and Your Community," listing elected officials with their addresses and telephone numbers and district maps.         When the city created community boards, she produced an explanatory pamphlet. And to visualize the city's economy and financing, she created charts titled "Money Go Round."         She also worked several stints in government. She served in the city transportation agency and in public relations for Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She was also an aide to Angier Biddle Duke and Eleanor Roosevelt at the United Nations.         Mrs. Sable, whose maiden name was Berger, was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University. Her husband of 48 years, Benjamin, died in 1986. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz, a great-grandniece of Chief Sitting Bull, who devoted her life to making American Indian culture available to other Americans, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 85 years old and had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, and Douglaston, Queens, since 1928.         She died of cancer, said Marjorie Weinberg, a family friend.         As director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island from 1930 to 1950, Rosebud, as she preferred to be called, enthralled legions of visitors with information about and stories from Indian culture.         Rosebud, who was born near Rapid City, S.D., was a descendant of the Lakota-Oyate, called the Sioux by the white settlers. Through her family's prominence, she came to know many well-known figures like President Calvin Coolidge, whom she helped induct into Lakota membership in 1927; Cecil B. DeMille, who tried to persuade her to star in his films, and the planner Robert Moses, who hired her for the Jones Beach post.         Last year Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was her name that inspired Orson Welles to make "Rosebud" the last word spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of his 1941 film classic, "Citizen Kane." He based his assertion on what he said were recently discovered daily sign-in sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Mr. Welles and Rosebud worked on several dramatic shows during the late 1930's.         Mr. Welles, who died in 1985, never revealed the source for the name "Rosebud."         After leaving her post at Jones Beach in 1950, Rosebud continued to lecture and write on Indian culture. Her book, "The Album of the American Indian," was published in 1969 by Franklin Watts Inc., and a second book, "Tonewaya and the Eagles," was published in 1979 by Dial Press.         In 1989 Rosebud received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of South Dakota. She had attended the university from 1925 to 1927.         Rosebud's first husband, Arthur de Cinq-Mars, died in 1949. A sister, Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse, died in 1981.         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz is survived by her husband, Alfred Frantz; a daughter, Tachawin Moy, of Brooklyn; a granddaughter, Karen Winona Moy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Evelyn Robe Finkbeiner, of Bad Pyrmont and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.       
         Bertina Suida Manning, a scholar of Italian art and a collector of French and Italian paintings and drawings, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         She died of heart failure, said a friend, Mary Jane Harris.         Mrs. Manning was born in Vienna and was the only child of William E. Suida, an eminent Viennese art historian known for his work on Leonardo da Vinci and Genoese painting. She moved with her parents to the United States in 1939 and attended Queens College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she met her husband, Robert Lee Manning, an art collector who became director of the art gallery at Finch College in Manhattan.         With her father, she wrote a book on Luca Cambiaso, a 16th- century Genoese painter. From her father, Mrs. Manning inherited thousands of Italian and French paintings and drawings, to which she and her husband added major works. During the 1950's she advised the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. In 1962-63, she and her husband organized the first United States exhibition of Genoese painting, which traveled from Dayton, Ohio, to Sarasota, Fla., to Hartford. Since 1989 she had served as president of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College.         The Mannings were known for making their collection at their home available to students, curators and many others from around the world. Works from the Suida Manning collection have been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and the National Gallery in Washington, among other institutions. Paintings by Guercino and Mattia Preti are among the works now on loan to the Metropolitan, where they are on view in the museum's galleries of Baroque painting.         She is survived by her husband; her daughter, Sandy Manning Dolnier, and a grandson, John Robert Dylan.       
         Elinor Kridel Bernheim, a social-welfare volunteer whose widely cast interests ranged from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and Columbia University's School of Social Work to a community center she founded in the Bronx, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 85 years old.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Bernheim relentlessly made the rounds of board rooms, foundation offices and charity luncheons and dinners, starting in the 1940's. In 1975, she still sat on the boards of 11 charities. At the time, The New York Times's About New York column described her as "The Queen of Volunteers," who was "the champion volunteer worker in town."         "I love this kind of work," she said between meetings with people who held the purse strings to grants for worthy causes. Sometimes it kept her busy for 15 hours a day, she said.         "You know why we do it?" she asked. "Because it shows we're alive. So many of the younger women now want to get paid. It's a status thing with them."         "I'll tell you what I'm good at," she declared. "I'm good at finding people for boards because I know a lot of people. I'm good at organizing, fund-raising and whipping up enthusiasm.         "I don't fight with anyone unless I have to get things done -- and then I'm a dog, very mean." She also was a critic of professional social-work jargon that she said could scare otherwise interested laypeople off.         Mrs. Bernheim, whose late husband, Leonard, was a stockbroker, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1985. She recovered enough to return to the causes closest to her heart -- in a wheelchair or by telephone -- until her death.         Among those lasting interests were the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, which she began in the 1950's and presided over until 1970. It was innovative because it was affiliated with a hospital, Montefiore Medical Center. Others included the New York chapter of the National Council on Alcoholism and Young Concert Artists, which helps talented young people to start a career.         Also remaining dear to her heart was the New York School of Social Work at Columbia, a place where she did postgraduate work after her 40th birthday, in the 1947-48 academic year. She later served as a member of its advisory board and took special pride when Columbia awarded her its Bicentennial Medal in 1956. It was but one of many honors bestowed on her.         Mrs. Bernheim was born Elinor Kridel in New York City on June 26, 1907, and graduated from Vassar College in 1928. By 1941, she was a member of the board and the council of the Association for Aid for Crippled Children.         Her relationship with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies went back to her years as a young woman. She became a trustee in 1942 and two years later was co-host of a luncheon addressed by Eleanor Roosevelt.         She served as chairwoman of the women's division fund campaigns in 1943, 1944 and 1949. After that, she became a vice president of the federation and board chairwoman of the women's division.         Over the decades, Mrs. Bernheim also was an officer or otherwise involved in, among others, the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Conference for Social Welfare, an advisory committee on volunteer services for the Veterans Administration, the United Neighborhood Houses of New York City, the National Council on Social Work Education and the Associated Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations.         She was also involved with the Community Council of Greater New York, the Community Service Society, the National Homemakers Service Council and the Brookdale Institute on Aging, among others. She was a co-founder of the Florence G. Heller Research Center. She served three terms as vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York and was elected its first president in 1973.         Mrs. Bernheim's husband died in 1980. She is survived by two sons, Leonard H. Jr. and Charles A., both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Abigail Adams Eliot, a social worker who became a nationally known authority on early childhood education, died Thursday at the New England Deaconess Home, a nursing home in Concord, Mass. She had celebrated her 100th birthday on Oct. 9.         She died of a heart attack, said Jay Chrepta, a spokesman for Tufts University.         Dr. Eliot became active in the field after World War I, when the first few nursery schools with child study centers were set up in the United States.         After enrolling in the early 1920's at the Rachel MacMillan School and Training Center in London, one of the few schools that then trained nursery school teachers, Dr. Eliot returned to the United States, and she and Elizabeth W. Pearson, a Boston philanthropist, founded the Ruggles Street Nursery School in the Roxbury section of Boston. It taught children and also provided teacher-training in early childhood education.         In later years Dr. Eliot's institution evolved, becoming successively the Ruggles Street Nursery School and Training Center and the Nursery Training School of Boston. She was its director from 1922 until she retired in 1952.         That year, the institution was incorporated into Tufts, was moved to Medford, Mass., and was renamed the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University.         During the Depression, the Roosevelt Administration's Federal Emergency Relief Administration, with the cooperation of the United States Office of Education, organized what it called emergency nursery schools for needy children. Dr. Eliot, who was then secretary-treasurer of the National Association for Nursery Education, became a member of the National Advisory Committee for the program.         She was born in Boston, graduated from Radcliffe College in 1914 and was a social worker for several years. She received her doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1930.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dr. Gloria Glikin Fromm, a professor of English at the University of Illinois in Chicago, died Nov. 12 at Governors Park, a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Barrington, Ill. She was 61 years old and lived in North Barrington.         She died of complications from lung-cancer, said her husband, Harold.         Dr. Fromm specialized in biography and modernist studies, covering writers in the first half of the century, particularly T. S. Eliot. Ezra Pound and Virginia Woolf. She was the author of many essays and "Dorothy Richardson: A Biography" (University of Illinois Press, 1977), the life of the pioneering English writer of stream-of-consciousness fiction.         Born in Newark, she received her undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees from New York University. She began her academic career at Brooklyn College in 1961 and, in 1970, moved to the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, where she became a full professor in 1978.         Besides her husband, Dr. Fromm is survived by her sister, Selma Margolis, and her brother, Nathan Glikin, both of Union, N.J.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Dr. Eleanor P. Spencer, a scholar of medieval art, died on Tuesday at Le Vieux Chateau, a retirement home near Paris. She was 97 years old.         Dr. Spencer was the first woman to receive the Sachs Fellowship for Research in the Fine Arts from Harvard University, which enabled her to earn a doctorate at Radcliffe College. Earlier, she had received a bachelor's and a master's degree from Smith College and had studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.         After nearly 10 years of teaching at Smith, at Mount Holyoke and at Wellesley, she became an associate professor of art at Goucher College in Baltimore and remained there until her retirement at age 67. While teaching at Goucher, she also served on the board of the Baltimore Museum of Art and other local art institutions, and was co-author with Richard H. Howland of "The Architecture of Baltimore: A Pictorial History."         After retiring, Dr. Spencer received a Fulbright grant and returned to Paris, where she researched 15th-century French book illustration and wrote articles for scholarly journals. Most of her work was devoted to the Sobieski Hours, a manuscript in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.         There are no survivors.       
         Audre Lorde, a black feminist writer who became the poet laureate of New York State in 1991, died on Tuesday at her home on St. Croix. She was 58 years old.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Blanche Cook.         Ms. Lorde had had cancer for 14 years and in 1980 wrote "The Cancer Journals," which traced the first stages of her disease.         From the publication of her first book in 1968, Ms. Lorde's 17 volumes of poetry, essays and autobiography reflected her hatred of racial and sexual prejudice. Among them are "Cables to Rage" (1970); "Coal" (1976); "Zami: A New Spelling of My Name" (1983), and, most recently, "Undersong: Chosen Poems Old and New," which was recently published by W. W. Norton.         A collection of essays, "A Burst of Light," won an American Book Award in 1989. Her 1973 collection, "From a Land Where Other People Live," was nominated for a National Book Award.  Active Politically and Academically         Ms. Lorde, who also used her adopted African name, Gamba Adisa, was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Library Science. She became an English professor at Hunter and lectured widely throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. She was active in many literary and political organizations and a founding member of Women of Color Press and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa.         She was an outspoken lesbian and served on the board of the Feminist Press in New York City and often gave readings of her works at Judith's Room, a feminist bookstore in Greenwich Village.         Among her honors were the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit in 1991, making her the poet laureate of New York; the Manhattan Borough President's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1988, and honorary doctorates from Hunter, Oberlin and Haverford Colleges.         Her marriage to Edwin Rollins ended in divorce.         She is survived by her companion, Gloria I. Joseph of St. Croix; a son, Jonathan Rollins, and a daughter, Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, both of New York City, and four sisters, Helen Lorde, Phyllis Blackwell and Marjorie and Mavis Jones.       
         Enid Schechter, who served as the executive assistant to four Speakers of the New York State Assembly in the Legislature's New York City office, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Ms. Schechter's 20-year career on the legislative staff included working for Speakers Stanley Steingut, Stanley Fink, Melvin Miller and Saul Weprin. Before her government work, she was an assistant to the president of London Records.         She was born in Great Neck, L.I., and was a graduate of Drew University.         Surviving are her husband, Martin; a son, Steven; a daughter, Susan Weprin, who is married to a nephew of the Speaker, and a granddaughter, all of Manhattan.       
         Alice I. Bryan, a psychologist who fostered the advancement of women in her profession and who led a major study on the role of libraries, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, her relatives said. Her death was reported yesterday by Columbia University, where she had taught for 35 years.         Dr. Bryan was a founder and president of the National Council of Women Psychologists. Its first meeting was held in her apartment. She was also an officer of the American Association for Applied Psychology and the American Psychology Association.         This year she addressed the American Library Association, which honored her on the 40th anniversary of her book "The Public Librarian." Based on interviews with more than 3,000 librarians, it explored the role of libraries as centers of mass communication.         Dr. Bryan started teaching part time at Sarah Lawrence College and Pratt Institute in the 1930's, and joined Columbia's Library School in 1939 as a psychologist and teacher. She became its first female full professor and helped organize its doctoral program. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Bryan, whose family name was Bever, was born in Kearny, N.J. Her marriages to Chester Bryan and Frank Blasingame ended in divorce. Her third husband, George V. Fuller, died in 1960.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Vanessa S. Lynn, a New York gallery director who wrote about contemporary American crafts, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center. She was 42 years old and lived in Valley Stream, L.I.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lynn held a B.A. degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton and an M.A. in library science from Queens College. During the 1970's she worked as an art and architecture librarian at Pratt Institute.         She was a founder, in 1979, of the Cooper/Lynn Gallery in Manhattan, which presented works in clay, fiber and metal. She was also an advocate for removal of the distinction between crafts and fine arts, a theme that permeated her writing.         In 1985, she became the director of Gallery at Workbench, based at the chain's main store at Park Avenue and 32d Street. It showed the creations of young furniture artists. She also traveled to Workbench's other stores in the city.         She was a regular contributor to periodicals, including American Craft, American Ceramics, Metalsmith, Ornament, Glass and the German crafts magazine Art Aurea. At the time of her death, she was associate editor of American Ceramics magazine.         Mrs. Lynn is survived by her husband, Lawrence R.; her mother and stepfather, Sylvia and Ralph Lippman of Manhattan; a brother, Keith Stanger of Ypsilanti, Mich., and four stepbrothers, David Lippman of Eureka, Calif., Dr. Jay Lippman of Manhattan, Jonathan Lippman of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Leonard Lippman of West Hartford, Conn.       
         Jacqueline K. Eubanks, a college librarian, an editor and a proponent of multicultural education, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of complications from AIDS, said friends and colleagues at the library at Brooklyn College, where she was on the faculty since 1966.         Ms. Eubanks significantly expanded the college library's African and Caribbean collection and was a founding member of the Social Responsibilities Roundtable of the American Library Association.         She was the originator and senior editor of "Alternatives in Print," an international catalog of books, pamphlets, periodicals and audio-visual material not easily found in mainstream references works. She also helped organize book fairs in the city.         Ms. Eubanks grew up in Chicago. She earned her bachelor's degree and master's degree in library science at the University of Chicago and a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College.         Before joining Brooklyn College, she worked as a librarian for the United States Army Special Services in Germany and for the American Association of Advertising Agencies in Manhattan.         Her marriage to Lloyd W. Eubanks ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Alan Peldzus of Chicago.       
         Joann Thompson, a New York City health-care advocate and an advocate for social and religious causes, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a short illness, friends said.         Ms. Thompson organized and led the Health Action Resource Center since 1984. She was also a founder in 1979 of the Religious Committee on the New York City Health Crisis, of which she was executive director.         Among the issues her organizations focused on were reductions in government aid to health programs, health care for the poor, infant mortality, the spread of AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics, sickness among the homeless and the shortages of nurses and of treatment for drug addiction.         Born in Tifton, Ga., Ms. Thompson grew up in Austin, Tex. In 1956 she graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. There she worked with the Faith and Life Community, an ecumenical, interracial program of religious action in civil rights and other social issues.         After studying at Harvard Divinity School and Princeton Theological Seminary, she served on the faculty of the Ecumenical Institute in Chicago for 10 years.         Then she worked for the Young Women's Christian Association in St. Louis, New York City and San Francisco in programs for youth and community relations. In 1973 she became an administrator at the National Hemophilia Foundation in New York.         There are no immediate survivors.

         Charlotte Jones, an actress who appeared in plays and musicals on and Off Broadway and in regional theater, died on Nov. 6 at Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. She was 76 years old and lived in Toms River.         Her death was reported yesterday by her husband, Matteo Bocchino, who said she died of heart disease.         Ms. Jones, whose original name was Charlotte Nathanson, was born in Chicago on Jan. 1, 1916. She was a graduate of Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa, and attended Loyola University Medical School and Loyola University Law School in Chicago. A first marriage, to Dr. Richard Jones of Chicago, ended in divorce in 1947; subsequently Ms. Jones came to New York City to make a career as an actress and dancer, and won her first role on Broadway in 1952 in the musical "Buttrio Square," starring Billy Gilbert. In 'Camino Real'         She appeared in Elia Kazan's Broadway production of Tennessee Williams's play "Camino Real" in 1953, and acted in the play again when it was revived at Circle in the Square in 1980 under the direction of Jose Quintero.         She created the dual roles of Madame Branislowski and Mother Burnside in the 1966 Broadway production of "Mame," starring Angela Lansbury; played the Wall Street widow, Mrs. Millhauser, in the 1967 Broadway musical comedy "How Now, Dow Jones," and acted with Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in 1976 in "A Matter of Gravity."

         Allene Z. Roach, a journalist and teacher whose struggle with Alzheimer's disease was described in a 1985 book by one of her daughters, died on Friday at the Fairfield Division of the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 65 years old.         She died of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Marion Roach Smith. Mrs. Smith wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine and a book, both titled "Another Name for Madness" (Houghton Mifflin, 1985), about her mother's ordeal.         Mrs. Roach attended Northwestern University and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1950. She began her career as a reporter and society editor of The Long Island Star-Journal, a daily newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that is defunct.         After earning a master's degree in education from the New School for Social Research in 1970, she taught at Escuela Hispana in Manhattan until her retirement in 1980.         She grew up in Douglaston Manor, Queens, and lived there until she moved into a nursing home eight years ago. Her husband, James P. Roach, who died in 1978, was the sports editor of The New York Times from 1958 to 1973.         In addition to Mrs. Smith, an author and freelance writer who lives in Petersburgh, N.Y., Mrs. Roach is survived by her daughter Margaret, the gardening editor of Newsday, who lives in Manhattan and Copake Falls, N.Y.       
         Catharine A. Yard, president of the American Timber Company, died on Thursday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 48 years old and lived in Sea Girt.         Ms. Yard died of pneumonia, said Michael Cherenson, a family spokesman.         In 1990 Ms. Yard became president of American Timber, which was founded by her grandfather in 1893. Ms. Yard, who attended Yuba College in Marysville, Calif., and Chico State University in Chico, Calif., had worked for the company since 1968.         Ms. Yard is survived by a son, Michael Saito, and three daughters, Michelle, Mikiko and Mary Catherine Saito, and her mother, Dorothy, all of Sea Girt; two sisters, Elizabeth Rasmussen, of Chico, Calif., and Victoria Steiner, of Seattle; four brothers, William, of Modesto, Calif., Carl Jr., of Wall Township, N.J., Richard, of Jackson Township, N.J., and Stephen, of Oroville, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Norma K. Regan, a high school teacher and sculptor, died on Tuesday in a convalescent home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 95 years old and had been a longtime resident of Hartford.         She died of pneumonia, said a spokesman for the DellaVeccia Funeral Home in Southington, Conn.         A member of the Hartford public school system for many years, Miss Regan taught English at Weaver and Bulkeley high schools. She also coached students for college entrance examinations.         Inspired by Alexander Caldor, she studied sculpture while teaching. Her works were exhibited in group shows at the New Britain Museum of American Art, the New Haven Paint and Clay Club, the Yale Art Gallery, the Springfield Museum in Massachusetts and other galleries.         Miss Regan graduated from Cornell University in 1919. She was a member of the Cornell Club of Greater Hartford from 1959 to 1979, actively involved in regional programming, student recruitment and fund raising. She also belonged to the Advisory Council in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell and the University Council. She was honored by the university in 1981 as a "foremost benefactor."         Miss Regan sponsored a film, "Cornell Plantations" in 1974-75 and was special consultant for a film, "Mr. President," in 1977-78, on the university's president, Frank H. T. Rhodes.  Both films were shown on public television in Connecticut and elsewhere.         She is survived by a cousin, Normadiene W. England of Southington.       
         Barbara Kauder Cohen, the author of more than 30 books for children and young adults, died on Sunday at her home in Bridgewater, N.J. She was 60 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Cohen's first book, "The Carp in the Bathtub," was published in 1972 when she was 39 years old. It won acclaim as a modern classic, enough to encourage her to leave her teaching position and devote more of her time to writing.         The book, like many of those that came later, was published by Lothrop and remains in print.         The range of her themes was unusually wide. A 1990 novel, "The Long Way Home," tells of a family coming to terms with cancer. "Molly's Pilgrim" (1983) is the story of a Jewish immigrant girl who enhances the meaning of Thanksgiving for her entire third-grade class; a movie version won an Academy Award in 1986 in the short-subject category.         "Canterbury Tales" (1988) re-creates the flavor of the time and the spirit of Chaucer's words for young readers. Graduated With Honors         A native of Newark, Mrs. Cohen was a 1954 graduate of Barnard College (magna cum laude; Phi Beta Kappa), and earned an M.A. from Rutgers University. She started a teaching career in 1955, in public schools in New Jersey.         She was inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame last year. Four of her books are to be published posthumously.         Mrs. Cohen's husband, Eugene, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughters, Leah Cohen Chatinover of South Windsor, Conn.; Sara Cohen of Kibbutz Ketura, Israel, and Rebecca Cohen Stewart of Bridgewater, N.J.; her mother and stepfather, Florence and Ed Nash of Bridgewater; a brother, Louis Kauder of Alexandria, Va.; a sister, Susan Schwirck of Rahway, N.J.; and three grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Beck Kris, a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, died Sunday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 59.         Dr. Kris died of cancer, said Harvard University, where she worked.         Dr. Kris, who received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1959, was assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the medical school and psychiatrist to the University Health Services. The major themes of her scholarly work were the emotional development of students and their interactions with teachers and counselors.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Anton O. Kris; two sons, David S. and Michael M. Kris, and a sister, Mary Ellen B. Wohl.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Georgia L. McMurray, a leader in developing services for children in New York City, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 58.         A quadriplegic, she had been suffering from a progressive nervous disease, said the Rev. Gerald L. Wagner, a friend.         Ms. McMurray was a former Commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development and deputy general director for programming of the Community Service Society of New York.         She was teaching as a professor at Fordham University's School of Social Work at the time of her death. She was also the president of a consulting firm, the GLM Group, which provides research, training, technical assistance and other management services to governmental and nonprofit organizations concerned with programs for children and families.         Her many honors included the Essence Award this year, given to her by Essence, a magazine for black women. This year, too, the Children's Aid Society cited her for distinguished service.         Ms. McMurray managed to continue her work even though her own disabilities forced her to walk on crutches.         Ms. McMurray was a graduate of Temple University and held a master's degree in social services from Bryn Mawr College. She came to public attention 22 years ago as the founder of Project Teen Aid for pregnant adolescents, which still exists.         The Lindsay administration tapped her in 1969 to develop services for young children and families as director of an Early Childhood Task Force. Two years later she became the first head of the child-development agency, an umbrella for the city's child-care and preschool programs not handled by the Board of Education. Under her guidance the number of day-care centers multiplied and the number of children served rose from 5,000 to 40,000.         She worked at the Community Service Society from 1978 to 1986, producing reports on homelessness and the changing demographics of urban poverty, and developing model programs for children and youths.         Ms. McMurray is survived by her mother, Daisy Fulen, and two sisters, Caroline Johnson and Narvine Fulen, all of Philadelphia.       
         Marilyn Neufeld Bergner, a professor and researcher who helped to develop a widely used system for evaluating the medical condition of patients, died Dec. 12 at her home in Silver Spring, Md.. She was 59.         She died of ovarian cancer, her family said.         Since 1986, Dr. Bergner was a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.         In her prior teaching post at the University of Washington School of Public Health from 1972 to 1986, she was on the team that developed the Sickness Impact Profile. It measures the patient's level of functioning and monitors the progress during the course of an illness, based on periodic questionnaires filled out by the patient. The form is now widely used around the world.         Dr. Bergner was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. After earning a doctorate in socio-medical science at Columbia University in 1970, she served two years as an assistant to the first vice president at New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation.         Surviving are her husband of 39 years, Dr. Lawrence Bergner, a physician; her mother, Clara Neufeld of Brooklyn; two sons, Daniel of Manhattan, and Robert of Montreal, and a granddaughter.       
         Rebecca Grand, a former teacher and assistant principal in New York City public schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Miss Grand fell last winter and grew progressively weaker afterward, said her lawyer, Hazel Schizer.         During a 35-year career from 1937 to 1972, Miss Grand was a history teacher, guidance department chairman and an assistant principal of Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn. Before that, she taught history and economics at Hunter College High School from 1929 to 1937. She retired in 1972.         Miss Grand, a native of Brooklyn, received a bachelor's degree at Hunter College in 1929 and a master's degree at Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1931.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Barbara Rollock, an authority on children's literature who worked for 32 years with the New York Public Library, died on Sunday at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 70 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of colon cancer, said her son David.         Joining the Public Library as a clerk at the Aguilar Branch Library in Harlem in 1945, Mrs. Rollock rose to become coordinator of Children's Services in 1974, a post she held until retirement.         For nearly a decade, she moderated the weekly show, "World of Children's Literature," on WNYC public radio, receiving the International Reading Association's media award for radio in 1982.         Mrs. Rollock was former president of the New York Black Librarians Caucas and a past president of the children's divisions of the American Library Association and the New York Library Association.         She was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in Library Science from Columbia University.         She is the author of two books, "Black Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books," published in 1992 by Garland Publishing, and "Public Library Services for Children," published in 1988 by Library Professional Publications. She also edited the 1974, 1979 and 1984 editions of "The Black Experience in Children's Literature," a bibliography, published by the New York Public Library.         Besides her son David, of Zionsville, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Howard, and another son, Phillip Theodore, also of Brooklyn.       
         Carol Bondhus Fitzgerald, head of readers' services at the Mina Rees Library of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Tuesday in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 51 and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Professor Fitzgerald died of cancer at Northern Westchester Hospital Center, said Christy DeBoe Hicks, a City University spokeswoman.         A specialist in American Presidential bibliographies, Professor Fitzgerald was the series editor of three continuing multivolume bibliographies: Bibliographies of the American Presidents, Bibliographies of the United States, and Bibliographies of American Notables. She had been editor of American History: A Bibliographic Review from 1985 to 1991, and history editor of the Bulletin of Bibliography from 1981 to 1990.         She was born in New York City. She graduated from Rosary College in River Forest, Ill., and earned master's degrees at New York University and Columbia University. She joined the Rees Library in 1969.         She is survived by her husband, Kevin; a son, Matthew; three daughters, Anna, Katherine and Margaret, all of Bedford Hills; her mother, Anna Bondhus; her brother, Nelson, of Farmington, Conn., and a sister, Diana Bortolin, of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Helen Joseph, a white dissident who was repeatedly detained and harassed by the South African Government in a long struggle against apartheid, died today in a hospital here. She was 87.         She died of complications from a stroke she had suffered two weeks ago, news agencies reported.         Mrs. Joseph became prominent here as a symbol of white opposition to the racial policies of her adopted land in the years after World War II when apartheid gained legal force. In this way, she was ahead of most other white foes of the system of racial separation.         The Government responded in kind, for more than three decades placing the often-ailing, ever-defiant Mrs. Joseph under various forms of house arrest and issuing banning orders that prohibited her from receiving more than one visitor at a time.         She was also declared a "listed person," a punishment intended to prevent her from being quoted in any form.         Even when formally silenced, she never accepted the restrictions, imposed under the Suppression of Communism Act. "You can't silence yourself," she once told an interviewer.         In the ranks of anti-apartheid campaigners, Mrs. Joseph was a militant, an associate of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, who once referred to her as part of their "family." From Polite Background         It was not a role that her upbringing might have suggested. Born in Sussex in England in 1905, Helen Beatrice May Fennell seemed set for a middle-class English life. She graduated with an honors degree from the University of London in 1927 and went on to teach for three years in India.         Arriving in South Africa in 1931, she settled in Durban, married a dentist, and "threw herself into the life style of a socialite," as The Weekly Mail of Johannesburg said in 1986. "In those days," the profile of her added, "she was known as beautiful and flighty, leading a life of wining and dining and bridge parties."         Friends say her service as an information and welfare officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force in World War II and a subsequent decision to become a social worker in Cape Town and Johannesburg exposed her to some of the realities of South Africa.         Divorced in 1948, she became a founder of the Congress of Democrats, the white wing of the African National Congress. In 1955, she was present for the adoption of the congress's Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a South Africa without racial discrimination.         The following year, Mrs. Joseph helped lead a march of 20,000 women on the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest the extension of laws requiring blacks to carry passes. She was arrested and charged with treason, and a year later was put under the first of a series of banning orders. Overcame Cancer         In 1961, Mrs. Joseph was acquitted of treason after a marathon trial. But from 1962 to 1971, as a banned person, she was not allowed to receive visitors on weekends or at night, or to socialize with more than one person at a time. The order was lifted when she entered a hospital for cancer treatment.         "I had a cancer operation and then I had a major heart attack," she told an interviewer, "and they must really have thought, 'This old girl can't go on much longer.' "         But she did go on, campaigning at English-language universities. In 1978, she was jailed again, this time for contempt after she refused to testify against Winnie Mandela.         In August 1983, she became a sponsor of the United Democratic Front, which orchestrated the protest campaign of the mid-80's on behalf of the still-outlawed African National Congress. The campaign led to international sanctions against South Africa and ultimately to President F. W. de Klerk's offer of political change and to Mr. Mandela's release in 1990.         By then some reforms had begun, including the lifting of racial restrictions in public places. It seemed that Mrs. Joseph had outlasted a legal system that persecuted her. But her age and health problems, like a painful infirmity from leg fractures, confined to a wheelchair. She was no longer strong enough to speak at rallies.         Nonetheless, when Mr. de Klerk conducted a referendum in March, seeking approval to continue talks toward nonracial democracy, Mrs. Joseph appeared in public to tell supporters that she was voting for changes she had sought for more than four decades.       
         Dr. Helene Wallace Toolan, a cancer researcher, died on Sunday at Southwestern Vermont Hospital Center in Bennington. She was 80 years old and lived in Old Bennington, Vt.         She died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her family said.         Dr. Toolan, a native of Chicago, graduated with honors from the University of Chicago at the age of 17 and received a Ph.D. in pathology from Cornell Medical Center. She was on the staff of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York from 1950 until 1964.         Dr. Toolan did basic research on the transplantation of human tumors and tissues into laboratory animals. In 1955 she received the Sloan Award for her work. Linked Cancers to Virus         She also studied the relationship between viruses and human cancer cells, leading a team of researchers that succeeded in linking viruses to eight types of human cancer in 1960. Previously only leukemia, a cancer affecting the blood, had been linked to a virus.         In 1964 Dr. Toolan moved to Bennington to direct the newly established Putnam Memorial Institute for Medical Research. In 1987 the institute was renamed the Helene W. Toolan Institute for Medical Research. She became director emeritus and senior scientist of the institute in 1978 and director emeritus and trustee in 1985.         Dr. Toolan was also an avid gardener, horticulturist and ornithologist, and participated in a project to beautify downtown Bennington in the early 1970's. The Garden Club of America gave her its Horticulural Award in 1982.         Her first husband, Dr. Edward Wallace, died in 1943. She later married Dr. James M. Toolan, who survives her. Also surviving are two sons, Robin Wallace of Gainesville, Fla., and Alan Wallace of Las Vegas, Nev.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Boyle, a short-story writer and novelist renowned for her deft and powerful style and her keen insights into human nature, died on Sunday night at the Redwoods, a retirement community in Mill Valley, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived at the Redwoods, where she had moved from San Francisco several years ago.         She had been in declining health for a year, said her son, Ian von Franckenstein of Kentland, Calif.         Miss Boyle wrote four dozen books, including many works of fiction, seven books of poetry and four books for children. But it was for her short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, Harper's and elsewhere, that she was particularly acclaimed. Some critics have called "The White Horses of Vienna" (1936) an especially fine collection of her stories.         She won two O. Henry Memorial Awards for short-story writing, one for the title story of that 1936 collection and one for "Defeat" in 1941. She also won a Guggenhiem Fellowship in 1934. The Lady as Radical         The writer Stephen Vincent Benet once described Miss Boyle's style as being "as bright as an icicle and light as the bones of a bird." And the critic Louis Kronenberger once contended that the fineness of her insights was "such as no other writer of our time, in English at least, can match."         Her work, which also included essays and translations, commanded admiration from critics for more than half a century. It was colored by years of living in different parts of Europe -- she moved to Brittany in 1923, then lived in Paris and elsewhere -- and by social and political concerns. Her 1936 novel "Death of a Man" contained material from her life in Austria in the mid-1930's.         Late in her life, Miss Boyle wrote that she saw herself "as a dangerous 'radical' cleverly disguised as a perfect lady." She reported that she could not remember a time beyond the age of 6 when she had not been committed in favor of, or opposed to, something. Her activities ranged from helping the families of conscientious objectors in World War I to supporting human-rights causes and demonstrating against United States involvement in Vietnam. But she also had passionate and abiding literary concerns.         Reviewing a 1988 collection of her short stories, "Life Being the Best & Other Stories," edited by Sandra Whipple (New Directions), Ann Hornaday wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book celebrated her "enduring artistic discipline.' At Home in Europe         "Unlike some of her better-known peers," Ms. Hornaday wrote, Miss Boyle "survived the halcyon days of Paris in the 1920's," and although she "is not as notorious as some of the other Moderns -- those intrepid expatriate writers who set out to change language, mesh literature and social context and expose the dissonance of contemporary life -- she evokes these tensions with a gossamer fineness."         Miss Boyle was born in St. Paul on Feb. 19, 1902, the daughter of Howard P. Boyle and the former Katharine Evans. She spent much of her childhood in Europe and then returned to the United States, where she attended school in Washington for a time.         After financial problems, the family moved to Cincinnati. Miss Boyle took violin lessons at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and attended the Ohio Mechanics Institute from 1917 to 1919, intending to go into architecture.         With her first husband, Richard Brault, a French engineer whom she had met in Cincinnati and married in 1923, Miss Boyle briefly lived in New York City, where she attended Columbia University. The couple then went to Europe, where Miss Boyle stayed for almost 20 years, living in England as well as France and Austria, and taking a fellow American expatriate, Laurence Vail, as her second husband in 1931 after she was divorced from her first.         In that period, she looked more kindly on Europeans than on her compatriots and on many of her fellow female writers. "I like to be with people who work -- English, French, or any foreign working people," she wrote, but "I am ill at ease with Americans."         She observed that most women "do not write simply or violently enough for my taste." She added, "I should like my prose to be lucid, direct and lean." A Poet in Later Years         Miss Boyle and Mr. Vail returned to the United States in 1941. They later divorced, and in 1943 she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein.After World War II she was a correspondent in Europe for The New Yorker for a time. She went on to become a professor of English and creative writing at San Francisco State University from 1963 to 1979.         Her son said her last new book to be published was was "Words That Must Somehow Be Said: Selected Essays of Kay Boyle" (North Point Press, 1985).         Reviewing "50 Stories," a collection of her work published in 1980, Vance Bourjaily wrote in The New York Times that the stories included such techniques as "literary simplification, rhythmic repetition, the mixing in of vernacular, stream of consciousness, density of impressions, radical imagery and experiments with surrealism." The collection was republished this year by New Directions Books.         Mr. Von Franckenstein said Miss Boyle had continued to write and that most of her recent work was poetry, some of which had been published.         In addition to her son, an actor whose stage name is Ian Swift, she is survived by a sister, Joan Detweiler of Sarasota, Fla.; four daughters, Sharon Cowling of Vezenobres, France; Kathe Vail, who lives outside Paris; Clover Vail of New York City, and Faith Gude of Boston; 17 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Rebecca Ann Donovan, a sociologist and an associate professor at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Robert Bazell, a friend.         Professor Donovan was the head of research at the Hunter College School of Social Work. She specialized in the study of the social consequences of economic change, such as the impact of job loss on individuals.         She was born in Peoria, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in 1968 and a doctorate from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1983. Before joining the Hunter faculty, she taught at New York University and Columbia, where she was research director of the school's Industrial Social Welfare Center.         She is survived by her companion, Susan Hajjar; her mother, Sarah Donovan of Winter Park, Fla., and a sister, Janette Harriott of Edmond, Okla.       
         Antoinette Deland Carter, a travel writer, died on Friday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 53 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Carter died of cancer, said her husband, Stephen Carter.         Known professionally as Antoinette Deland, she wrote three popular travel guides: Fielding's Worldwide Cruises, which she began writing in 1985 and wrote for five revised editions; Fielding's Far East, which she wrote in 1983, 1987, and 1990, and Fodor's Bermuda, which she wrote from 1979 through 1987.         Mrs. Carter was a native of Rochester.         She studied at Bryn Mawr College and received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.         In addition to her husband, Stephen, an architect and photographer who contributed to her articles, Mrs. Carter is survived by two brothers, Dr. Thomas Killip, of Manhattan, and Colbeth Killip, of Ogonquit, Me., and an aunt, Priscilla Balaban, of Wilmington, N.C.       
         Emily Martenet Gnichtel, who was active in New York philanthropic organizations, died Tuesday evening at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 56 and lived in Madison, N.J., and at the Onteora Club in Hunter Township, N.Y.         She died of heart failure after a short illness, said her husband, William Van Orden Gnichtel.         Over the years, Mrs. Gnichtel, whose surname is pronounced NICK-tell, was a member of the board of the Sheltering Arms Children's Service and the Katherine Herbert Fund, a foundation aiding people with lung ailments, and did volunteer work on behalf of the Welfare Trust Fund of the Junior League.         She also did volunteer fund-raising for educational institutions, including Smith College.         Mrs. Gnichtel was a horsewoman and served on committees of the National Horse Show Association. She and her husband, a lawyer, lived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the 1980's, where she organized horseback-riding classes.         Mrs. Gnichtel was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Spence School. She graduated from Smith in 1958 after spending her junior year studying in France.         She is survived by her husband, to whom she was wed in 1959; her mother, May Davies Hopkins Martenet, of Virginia Beach, and her two sons, William Van Orden Gnichtel Jr., of Montebello, N.Y., and Edwin Gnichtel, a student at Drew University in Madison.       
         Rosalind A. Lorwin, a professor emeritus of social psychology at San Diego State University and a former mayor of Del Mar, Calif., died Thursday at her home in Del Mar. She was 66.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Susan Feierabend Peters, of San Francisco.         Professor Lorwin specialized in the psychological analysis of political violence. She did much of her research on the topic with her former husband, Ivo K. Feierabend.         Professor Lorwin was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Lewis Lorwin, an economist, and Rose Strunsky, a writer. She was raised and educated in Switzerland before attending Swarthmore College, from which she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1946. She earned a master's degree in psychology from the University of California at Berkeley and a doctorate in the field from Yale University in 1955.         She was a member of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence in 1968.         Professor Lorwin was a member of the Del Mar City Council from 1980 to 1984 and was Mayor from 1983 to 1984.         A brother, Val R. Lorwin, died in 1982.         In addition to her daughter, Professor Lorwin is survived by her husband of 18 years, Alain Virnot; two sons, Tom, of Paris, and Steve, of Plainsboro, N.J; a brother, Boris, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Ruth Lynch Saunders, a psychoanalyst and a former magazine editor, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and also lived in Siasconset, Mass.         Mrs. Saunders died of cancer, said her son, Anthony D. Saunders, of Stamford, N.Y.         Mrs. Saunders received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1949, a master's degree from Columbia University School of Social Work in 1976, and a certificate in psycholanalytic training from the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in 1979.

         Fannie Bear Besser, who at the age of 20 became one of New Jersey's first female lawyers and did legal work until she was 90, died on Friday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, N.J. She was 92 years old and lived in East Orange, N.J.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Besser, who grew up in Newark, went directly from high school to the New Jersey Law School, now a part of Rutgers University. She enrolled there because it was the only school where she could attend night classes while working days, as a secretary.         She graduated first in her class, at age 20. Because she was under 21, she had to receive special permission from the state's chief justice to take the bar examination.         After practicing general law for four years, she left her career to have her children and rear them.         In the late 1930's she returned to legal work as a volunteer lawyer for various agencies: the New Jersey Board of Mediation, the Army's Legal Department, the Governor's Commission for Refugees after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Governor's Landlord-Tenant Committee in the 1960's.         In 1968 she became a full-time volunteer lawyer at the Essex-Newark Legal Services in Orange. There she advised and represented elderly people until her health failed 18 months ago.         Her work was honored by two Army commendations, a New Jersey State Bar award in 1986 and Governor Thomas Kean's Humanitarian of the Year Award in 1989. In 1990, the Rutgers Law School Alumni Association created the Fannie Bear Besser award for public service. She was the first recipient.         She was married for 56 years to Hyman Besser, who founded an accounting firm in Newark. He died 14 years ago.         Surviving are her son, Albert G., of South Orange; two daughters, Edith Segall of Harrison, N.Y., and Ann Scott of Windsor, Maine; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 11, 1992, Friday         An obituary on Sunday about one of the first female lawyers in New Jersey rendered her last name incorrectly in some editions. She was Fannie Bear Besser.       
         Helen Callaghan Candaele St. Aubin, the speedy outfielder whose swing won one batting title and inspired two movies about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died Tuesday night at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., at age 69. She died of breast cancer, according to her son Kelly Candaele, whose 1988 documentary about his mother's career, "A League of Their Own," inspired last summer's movie of the same name.         During her four seasons in the women's league that was formed in 1943 as a wartime alternative to the talent-depleted men's league, Mrs. St. Aubin, who played under her original name, Helen Callaghan, batted .257 and stole 354 bases in 388 games.         Mrs. St. Aubin was a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, who had been recruited at a Canadian softball tournament. Accompanied by her sister, Margie, who was sent by their father to keep an eye on her, she broke in with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes in 1944 and was an immediate star. She stole 112 bases in 111 games, and her .287 batting average was the league's second highest.         In 1945, when the team moved to Indiana and became the Fort Wayne Daisies, Mrs. St. Aubin, a left-handed batter, led the league with a .299 average and in extra-base hits (24), doubles (17) and home runs (3).         She became ill in 1946 and sat out the 1947 season before returning for part of the 1948 season, her last, and she was never again as sharp at the plate. But she stole 114 bases in 111 games in 1946.         Her former teammate Dottie Collins recalled yesterday how deceptive her appearance was on the field.         "When she was playing -- running or throwing -- she looked so dainty, that's the only word for it," said Mrs. Collins, who recalled the 5-foot-1 1/4-inch, 115-pound outfielder as a "tiny" woman who was "strong."         According to Mrs. Collins, the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, Mrs. St. Aubin's stance and swing are almost perfectly preserved in her son Casey Candaele, a switch-hitting infielder for the Houston Astros.         She married Bobby Candaele during her career and gave birth to the first of their five sons before the 1948 season. They settled in Lompoc, Calif., where she became a cleaning staff supervisor at a local hospital. She and Mr. Candaele were eventually divorced, and she later married Ronald J. St. Aubin.         The documentary Kelly Candaele and his friend Kim Wilson made in 1988 led directly to the movie starring Geena Davis and directed by Penny Marshall.         In addition to her husband, her sister, who is now Margaret Maxwell of Vancouver, and her sons Kelly and Casey, Mrs. St. Aubin is survived by a brother, Lou; two other sisters, Pearl McInnis and Kay Morrison; three other sons, Ricky, the former head football coach at the University of California at Santa Barbara; Rocky, a telephone company employee, and Kelly's twin brother, Kerry, a Richard Hofstadter fellow in history at Columbia University, plus three grandchildren.       
         Ruth Sleeper, a national leader in nursing education who helped raise academic standards for the nursing profession, died Thursday at her home in Braintree, Mass. She was 93.         She died after a long illness, said the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had been director of both the Nursing Service and School of Nursing from 1946 to 1966.         Miss Sleeper was a past president of the National League of Nursing Education and the National League for Nursing.         She helped lead the way in transforming nursing education by greatly expanding classroom instruction. She developed a curriculum that combined nine months of practical training with 28 months of academic classes.         Miss Sleeper, a native of Manchester, N.H., started her own nursing career at Massachusetts General, where she earned a diploma at the age of 23. Later she earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University's Teachers College.         She was an adviser to the State Department and was a representative to the Status of Women Commission at the United Nations. She was also an officer in the United Community Services, American Red Cross, International Council of Nurses and Nursing Advisory Council of the Veterans Administration.         Although retired, Ms. Sleeper remained active professionally until her death, advising two nursing schools.         She is survived by several nieces, grandnieces and grandnephews.
