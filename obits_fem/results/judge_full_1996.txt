         Susie Marshall Sharp, the first woman to be popularly elected to the post of  chief justice of a state supreme court in the United States, died on Friday at her home. She was 88.         Miss Sharp was appointed a North Carolina Superior Court judge in 1949, and she was appointed to the state's high court in 1962. Former Gov. Terry Sanford,  the Democrat who appointed her, recalled the moment on Friday.         There wasn't any question about her qualifications," Mr. Sanford said. "The selection of Susie Sharp to be a member of the Supreme Court was the most widely approved appointment that I ever made."         Miss Sharp was elected Chief Justice in November 1974, replacing William H. Bobbitt, her longtime colleague on the bench. She stayed until her mandatory retirement at age 72 in 1979.         Miss Sharp was not a feminist and lobbied against the Equal Rights Amendment. But many feminists championed her anyway, hoping that she would be appointed to  the United States Supreme Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Several prominent politicians, including Senators Sam Ervin and  Jesse Helms, tried without success to get Presidents to nominate her to the nation's highest court.         Miss Sharp is survived by two brothers, Dr. James C. Sharp and Thomas A. Sharp, and two sisters, Louise W. Sharp and Annie Hill Klenner.       
         Frances L. Loeb, who spent a dozen years as New York City's liaison to its vast corps of foreign diplomats and a lifetime maintaining a family tradition of philanthropy, died on Friday at her home on Park Avenue. Mrs. Loeb, who also had homes in Purchase, N.Y., and Lyford Cay, Nassau, the Bahamas, was 89.         "One thing I had in my mind," Mrs. Loeb said in 1990 when she announced a $7.5 million gift to Vassar College for construction of an art center, "I'm never going to be the richest person in the cemetery."         With her husband, John L. Loeb, an investment banker, and other family members, Mrs. Loeb was a benefactor of Barnard College (where Adele Lehman Hall  was named for her mother), of Central Park (the Loeb Boathouse and the Children's Zoo), Lewisohn Stadium (which bore her maternal grandfather's name),  the Loeb Student Center at New York University and the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar.         In 1990, the Loebs pledged $70.5 million to finance new faculty positions and scholarships to Harvard College, as well as programs and positions in the schools of design and public health. The gift also benefited the Loeb Drama Center, home to the American Repertory Theater, established in 1957 with help from the Loebs.         Mrs. Loeb was also a trustee of Vassar and Cornell University and an overseer of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         In addition to money, Mrs. Loeb gave time. For 12 years in the 1960's and 70's, during the administrations of Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, Mrs. Loeb was New York City's unsalaried commissioner for the United Nations and for the Consular Corps. Directing a staff of nine full-time and six part-time employees, Mrs. Loeb eased cultural shock and fostered amity in a foreign diplomatic community that numbered 35,000 people from 197 missions and 91 consulates.         Besides forgoing a salary, Mrs. Loeb stretched the commission's relatively scant $158,000 budget by coaxing, cajoling and wheedling tens of thousands of dollars from friends and family. She committed the gifts to financing lectures,  establishing nursery schools, providing counseling about high schools and colleges and sponsoring courses in English.         In 1976, Mrs. Loeb and her staff handled more than 1,800 inquiries about housing, education, traffic, consumer fraud, police, family matters and legal problems. Thirty volunteers made more than 900 visits or telephone calls to 796  new diplomatic arrivals, and Mrs. Loeb attended endless receptions, lunches and  dinner meetings.         Frances Lehman Loeb was born in Manhattan on Sept. 25, 1906, into two of the  German-Jewish families whose rise to prominence and zeal for public service were chronicled in Stephen Birmingham's 1972 book, "Our Crowd." These 100 or so families founded banking, securities and retailing empires and many were known for their philanthropies. Her mother was Adele Lewisohn, the daughter of Adolph  Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. One uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, became Governor of New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, became Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals.         Frances Lehman attended Vassar from 1924 to 1926. In 1926 she and John Loeb were married in the Park Avenue apartment of her grandfather Adolph Lewisohn. From the 1930's through the 1970's, Mr. Loeb was a partner in the investment firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Loeb was known as Peter, a name she traced to the days when she was "the unwanted girl baby" and "Peter Pan" was playing on Broadway.         "I was a sick child," she said, "and they called me Peter Pan, hoping that I  would live forever."         Besides her husband of 69 years, Mrs. Loeb is survived by their five children: Judith L. Chiara of Manhattan and Purchase, John L. Loeb Jr. of Manhattan and Purchase, Ann Loeb Bronfman of Washington, Arthur Lehman Loeb of Manhattan and Deborah Loeb Brice of London; 14 grandchildren, and more than 30 great-grandchildren.       
         Leslie D'Cora Holmes, an advocate of tenants' rights who was a member of the  New York City Rent Guidelines Board, died on Friday at a hospital in Albany. She was 39 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said the Legal Aid Society, where she was the supervising attorney in the Harlem office. Ms. Holmes was stricken on Friday while teaching at the summer program at Bennington College in Vermont. She was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to the Albany Medical Center, where she died.         Ms. Holmes, who was born in Rochester, graduated from the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., in 1982, where she studied urban affairs and public policy. She was a Root-Tilden Scholar at the New York University School of Law and received a Doctor of Laws degree in 1986.         She joined Legal Aid in 1986 as a staff attorney specializing in housing litigation. Her cases involved federally subsidized and city-owned housing and tenant cooperatives. In her position in Harlem, which she had since 1989, she trained and supervised a staff of 12 lawyers and paralegals. The work was concerned chiefly with housing and government benefits.         Mayor David N. Dinkins appointed her in the spring of 1993 as one of two tenant representatives on the Guidelines Board. Her term expired in December 1994, but she continued as a holdover since then.         Last month, the board voted 6 to 2 to enact the biggest increase since 1983 for rent-stabilized apartments. Ms. Holmes, a vocal leader of the tenant protesters, cast one of the nay votes.         She also was a member of the advisory committee to the Supervising Judge for  the Civil Court in Manhattan and served on the citywide task force on Housing Court.         Ms. Holmes was on a leave of absence from Legal Aid so she could accept an appointment for the fall semester at Columbia University, where she was to be a  visiting faculty member at the School of Law.         She is survived by her parents, Mitchell and Jacqualin Holmes of Rochester, and three brothers, Michael and Kirk, both of Silver Spring, Md., and Stacy, of  Arlington, Va.       
         Justice Birdie Amsterdam, who achieved several judicial firsts, including being the first woman elected to the New York State Supreme Court, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Lower East Side, just steps from where she was born.         Justice Amsterdam came to be called the "first lady of the judiciary" by her  peers and other admirers, a sobriquet earned during 35 years on the bench.         She was the first woman elected to the Municipal Court in New York County in 1940. She was active in the Democratic Party, but when she was up for re-election in 1949, she carried the endorsements of all three parties, all bar  associations, the Citizens' Union and the American Federation of Labor.         In 1954, she was appointed Acting Justice of the City Court, another first for a woman, and won election to the office the next year.         In 1958, she gained the Supreme Court bench as a Democrat-Liberal, supported  again by a long roster of civic, communal, educational, labor, scientific, philanthropic and religious groups. She served until 1975.         Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the first woman on the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest tribunal, recalled Justice Amsterdam's trailblazing  achievements in a 1991 article in the New York Law Journal.         The State Supreme Court was more than 250 years old before a woman was elected to it, Judge Kaye wrote, and even today women do not enjoy the status of equals in the legal profession. "Thoughts of Justice Amsterdam's arrival on the  New York State Supreme Court serve to remind of us both of how far we have advanced toward these objectives and how much they continue to elude us," she wrote.         Justice Amsterdam was one of six children of Joseph Amsterdam, a band leader  from Austria. At 12, she taught English to foreign-born neighbors. Growing up in a neighborhood of immigrants and the poor awakened a commitment to social issues that guided her life as a lawyer. Her concerns ranged from playgrounds to summer camps, from slum clearance to shelter for the aged and the infirm, and from medical care to tuition assistance that could give a student a leg up. One of her special interests was the advancement of women in the legal profession.         She graduated on a state scholarship from Hunter College High School at 17. Waiting to meet the age requirement for admission to New York University Law School, she spent a year studying economics, banking and accounting at City College. She took evening classes at N.Y.U. and held a full-time job at Mount Sinai Hospital, keeping records and accounts.         Once she received her law degree in 1922, Mount Sinai doctors helped her practice by steering friends her way. She swiftly established a reputation not only as a skillful lawyer but also as an eloquent friend of the downtrodden, a champion of women's rights and a diligent party worker. She became a Tammany Hall district co-leader on the East Side.         Justice Amsterdam was honored by scores of organizations. "Who's Who of American Women" named her outstanding woman of the year for 1960 in the legal field, citing her "pre-eminent attainments and the inspiration they offer to other women in your profession."         Justice Amsterdam is survived by a sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Judge Milton Sanders, with whom she shared a home on Second Avenue for 59 years, as well as another sister, Sybil Chizner of Hollywood, Fla.         Correction:  July 11, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday of Justice Birdie Amsterdam, the first woman elected to New York State Supreme Court, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Ruth Sanders, not Cynthia.       
         Judge Genevieve Blatt, the first woman to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania and to serve on the state's appellate court, died on Thursday at a  retirement home in Hampden Township, Pa. She was 83 and a former resident of Harrisburg.         She spent more than 50 years in public service, starting as secretary and chief examiner of the Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission in 1938.         She became a force in Pennsylvania's Democratic Party as a member of the Democratic National Committee and the party's National Policy Committee. She attended every Democratic National Convention from 1932 to 1972 and served as vice chairwoman of the Pennsylvania delegation at the 1956 convention. She was the secretary of the State Democratic Committee from 1948 to 1971.         She was an assistant city solicitor in Pittsburgh in the 1940's. In 1954 she  was elected Secretary of Internal Affairs, a statewide office. She was re-elected in 1958 and 1962 but lost her bid for a fourth term in 1966.         She won a tight race in a party primary to run for the United States Senate in 1964 but then lost the election by 50,000 votes to the Republican incumbent,  Senator Hugh Scott.         In 1972, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her to fill an unexpired term on the  Commonwealth Court, the state's appeals court. She won election on her own the next year, was re-elected in 1983, became a senior judge a year later and retired from the bench in 1993.         For her charitable, cultural and social work for the Roman Catholic Church, she received three papal honors, including the Lady Grand Cross in the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem.         Genevieve Blatt was born in East Brady, Clarion County. Majoring in economics, she received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh before graduating from its law school.         She is survived by two sisters, Sister Mary Frederick of Greensburg, Pa., and Bernadette B. McCloskey of Los Angeles, and a brother, Joseph A. Blatt of Pittsburgh.       
         Helen Wilson Nies, a former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, died on Wednesday, her 71st birthday, at Beebe Hospital in Lewes, Del. She lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was head injuries suffered in a bicycling accident a week earlier in Henlopen Acres, Del., the court said.         President Jimmy Carter named Judge Nies to the United States Customs and Patent Appeals Court in 1980, and President Ronald Reagan reassigned her to the Federal Circuit when that jurisdiction was established in October 1982. She became Chief Judge in June 1990, and served in that post until March 1994. She took senior status last November.         Judge Nies, a native of Birmingham, Ala., graduated from the University of Michigan in 1945 and, three years later, from Michigan Law School. She was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1948 but moved to Washington that year to work at the Justice Department.         She later was a counsel in the Office of Price Stabilization, but took eight years off in the 1950's to rear a family. Before her court appointment, she was a partner in Chicago and Washington law firms.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, John Dirk Nies; two sons, J. Dirk, of Rockville, Md., and Eric W., of New York City; a daughter, Nancy N. Sloan of Las Vegas, Nev.; her mother, Lida Wilson of Rockville; a brother, George E. Wilson, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth E. Moskowitz of Brooklyn, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 2 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A native and lifetime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she was 60.         Her family said the cause was scleroderma, a rheumatological disorder.         Judge Moskowitz first won election to the State Supreme Court in 1982 and was assigned to Criminal Term, Kings County. She was re-elected posthumously this month to a second 14-year term.         She received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's from the University of Connecticut, then joined the civil rights movement in the summer of 1961. On a mission to integrate a Jackson, Miss., lunch counter, she was arrested and charged with trespassing.         While in solitary confinement in a Mississippi state prison, she made a decision to go into law. She graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1964 and went to work for the Legal Aid Society. She was in private practice when she first ran for Civil Court in 1976.         Over the years, she presided over many cases of Medicaid fraud and official corruption. In 1988, one of her cases produced a memorable encounter with Mayor Edward I. Koch.  At issue was the forbearance she had shown to a score of former parking-meter collectors who had pocketed thousands of dollars. Because they had no prior records, she had accepted their guilty pleas and given them sentences that involved no jail time, fines or restitution. Mayor Koch was moved to appear in person to support the demand for such penalties by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman.         The judge scolded the Mayor for his trouble, pointing out that he was lavishing his attention on a case involving ''little people.'' She also faulted what she called the administration's sloppy supervision.         Yes, she told the Mayor, little people become malefactors, too, but they have rights. She added that the defendants ''are going to be treated just the way the big boys are being treated,'' alluding to politically connected officials involved in recent corruption scandals. She declined to amend her decision.         Justice Moskowitz served on professional panels, in the Office of Court Administration and the New York Task Force on Women in the Courts.         She is survived by her husband, Martin Gershon; a daughter, Leah, and two sons, Joel and Robert, all of Brooklyn Heights; a sister, Anne Lyons of Manhattan, and her mother, Gussie Moskowitz, also of Brooklyn.
