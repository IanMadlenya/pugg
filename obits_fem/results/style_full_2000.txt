         Catherine M. Rae, a writer who published her first novel at 73, died on Dec. 25 at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 85 and lived in Guilford, Conn.         Shortly after earning her Ph.D. at 65, Ms. Rae wrote her first book, ''Edith Wharton's New York Quartet,'' a work of literary criticism about the writer, who with Eudora Welty served as Ms. Rae's inspiration. The book was published in 1984.         Her first attempt at fiction went unpublished after an editor at St. Martin's Press suggested it was beyond repair and she should write another.         This resulted in ''Brownstone Facade,'' a mystery romance in the style and tone of her beloved Wharton set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1920. It was published in 1988 and called ''a cozy, intelligent diversion'' by The New York Times.         Seven other novels followed, among them ''Flight From Fifth Avenue'' and ''The Hidden Cove'' in 1995 and ''Sunlight on a Broken Column'' in 1997; an eighth is being edited for publication. Often set against the backdrop of fin de siecle New York society, her works frequently centered on a historical event like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Ms. Rae's literary papers -- she was an avid researcher -- will be donated to the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1931. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1935, a master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College in 1970 and a Ph.D. in English literature from Denver University in 1979.         Ms. Rae's husband, Gene, died on Nov. 13. She is survived by a son, David, of Ridgewood, N.J.; three daughters, Lucy Rae Ricciardi of Greenwich, Conn., Catherine Rae Reed of Littleton, Colo., and Mary Louise Rae Arnold of Fort Worth, and eight grandchildren.       
         Bonnie Cashin, one of the first designers to create and popularize that uniquely American approach to dress called sportswear, died Thursday after open heart surgery at New York University Medical Center. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Cashin was one of a handful of women in the 1940's and 1950's who made an important contribution to American fashion, at a time when Parisian couturiers dominated the runways and supplied most of the original fashions for manufacturers to copy. The breakthroughs achieved by Ms. Cashin and designers like Claire McCardell, Vera Maxwell, Anne Klein and Anne Fogarty still influence the way women dress, and paved the way for the success of American designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.         Renowned for her loose-fitting sportswear, Ms. Cashin described her unstudied, casual designs as ''articulating with the body.'' She was an early proponent of layering -- using several layers of light, fluid clothes, rather than one heavy garment. She pioneered the use of grommets in place of buttons and was the first important designer to make ponchos for women, introducing lightweight capes and ponchos that, she explained, ''didn't look like a horse should wear them.''         As far back as 1943, she showed boots with tweed suits and included them in almost every subsequent collection. Her ''pocketbook'' pocket, with a snap closing, was another feature that long distinguished Cashin designs. She was ahead of her time when she introduced canvas raincoats in 1952, industrial zippers in 1955, jumpsuits in 1956 and suede Indian dresses with fringes in 1957.         She opened her own business, Bonnie Cashin Designs, in 1952 and for the two ensuing decades also designed leather, jersey, canvas and tweed clothes for Philip Sills. In addition, she created handbags for Coach Leatherware, gloves for Crescendoe-Superb and rainwear for Modelia. In the early 1970's, she branched out into knitwear with styles knitted to shape, rather than cut and sewn, and with welt hems instead of traditional hems or ribbed cuffs. A popular innovation was a roomy turtleneck that did not require a zipper to get over the head.         Although her themes were often adopted by other designers, Cashin clothes had a look of their own. Her tweed ponchos were bound in leather, and her coats had a special, supple swing. For several years, there were Cashin departments in chic Paris and London stores.         ''Women buy Cashin clothes because they are cozy and comfortable, not because they bowl people over,'' the fashion writer Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times in 1968.         Her gloves had many of the same features as her clothes. Grommets were arranged in the back of one style so that the glove could almost have served as a set of brass knuckles. Brass toggles not only were ornamental but also held a pair of gloves together or attached them to a belt. Some had drawstrings at the top that could be tightened to keep out the wind.         Her classic designs for Coach in the early 1960's were the shoulder bag and what was called the Basic, a smaller clutch style with a removable shoulder strap. The first bag she designed, a leather carryall modeled after paper shopping bags, was later discontinued but has since become ubiquitous in the collections of numerous handbag companies.         She was intolerant of anything ugly, in appearance or design. When she traveled, she draped lengths of Thai silk in her hotel rooms and ordered quantities of flowers. She was also generous on the road, dispensing items in her wardrobe to anyone who admired them. She usually returned with a different wardrobe from the one she had packed, not only because she had given away her clothing but also because she was interested in acquiring fashion ideas from other countries.         ''Travel is my education,'' she said in a 1961 interview with Charlotte Curtis in The Times. ''Even if I don't use an idea right away, it's there.'' The idea of layering came from time she spent in Asia. ''The Japanese refer to cold weather as a nine-layer day,'' she explained in 1950. ''Hot is a one-layer day.''         One of her best-known innovations was the ''dog leash'' skirt, which came about because she was constantly holding her skirt going up steps in her country home in Briarcliff, N.Y. The long wool skirt could be instantly shortened by latching a small brass ring sewn near the bottom to a small brass clasp at the waistline.         Ms. Cashin was born on Sept. 28, 1915, in Oakland, Calif., the daughter of Carl Cashin, a photographer and inventor, and Eunice Cashin. The family lived in several towns in northern California during Ms. Cashin's early years, and in each her mother would open a custom dress shop. As a child she was given fabric scraps as playthings and soon began sewing and designing.         Shortly before her graduation from high school, she showed some of her sketches to the director of a Los Angeles ballet company and was hired to make costumes for the next performance. After graduation, she joined the company as its designer and in 1934 accompanied the manager to New York when he took over the Roxy Theater. Not yet 20, she created three costume changes a week for each of the variety theater's 24 dancers.         She often called her Roxy experience her ''formal schooling in design'' and credited it with her later ability to create clothes that looked good on figures in motion. The theater also propelled her into designing street clothes, initially a collection of sportswear for Adler & Adler, a manufacturing concern.         After the United States entered World War II, she was appointed to a committee to design uniforms for women in the armed forces. But the war also imposed restrictions on the civilian use of fabrics and trim. She returned to costume design, which had more leeway with fabrics, and moved to Hollywood. There, she joined 20th Century Fox and created the clothes for some 60 films, including ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' ''Laura'' and ''Anna and the King of Siam.''         Ms. Cashin enjoyed the work in Hollywood, explaining: ''I wasn't designing for fashion, but for characteristics, which is the way I like to design clothes for daily wear. I like to design clothes for a woman who plays a particular role in life, not simply to design clothes that follow a certain trend, or that express some new silhouette.''         She remained in Hollywood until 1949, when she returned to New York. Her casual, layered clothes struck a responsive chord in American women. Within three years, she had won the first of her Coty Awards and organized Bonnie Cashin Designs.         Ms. Cashin was also chosen the first designer for Patterns of The Times, American Designer Series, a monthly feature in The New York Times during the 1950's that made designer patterns available for home sewing.         She was inducted into the Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of Fame in 1972 after receiving her second Coty Award in 1968. Her designs are in more than a dozen museums and some 30 university collections.         She was among the designers highlighted in the 1998 Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibition ''American Ingenuity: Sportswear 1930's-1970's.'' A retrospective of her work is scheduled to open in September at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.         In 1979, she established the Innovative Design Fund awards, a nonprofit organization based in New York that gave up to $10,000 to designers with original ideas in home furnishings, textiles and fashion so they could transform their sketches into marketable products.         During her early design years, she was married briefly to Robert Sterner, an art director. They were later divorced. She is survived by her longtime companion, Curtis Kellar.         Bernadine Morris summed up Ms. Cashin's fashion philosophy and appeal in a 1968 article in The Times: ''In a day when most fashions seem stamped out by cookie cutters, hers look as if they had been touched with human hands.''         ''They have an uncompromising integrity, freedom and joy,'' Mrs. Morris wrote.         Her own career philosophy was summed up in a framed unsigned cartoon of trapeze performers she had hanging in her Manhattan apartment. One high-wire performer is advising the other, ''You've got to know when to let go.''       
         Sarah Caudwell, the British author whose modest but ecstatically received output of three erudite and maliciously witty mystery novels led at least one critic to compare her to Oscar Wilde, died on Jan. 28 at her home in London. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said Barney Karpfinger, her agent.         Ms. Caudwell produced her first novel, ''Thus Was Adonis Murdered,'' in 1981, during an accomplished career as a Chancery barrister. The novel was set in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where the author had practiced law. It featured a sleuth, Hilary Tamar, who taught law at Oxford, as did Ms. Caudwell.         Although the story revolved around the lusty antics of ''a decorative little group'' of junior barristers, it was the classical erudition and acerbic tongue of the narrator, whose sex is never stated, that set the droll tone of the series. ''I am an  historian'' was Tamar's explanation for the devious workings of his or her mind. ''My profession largely consists of speaking ill of the dead.''         ''The Shortest Way to Hades''  (1985) and ''The Sirens Sang of Murder'' (1989) continued in the same elegantly mannered style, with stories bound up in arcane areas of British law and steeped in obscure allusions to classical literature. (A crucial clue in ''The Shortest Way to Hades'' is embedded in Book XI of ''The Odyssey.'') Her final novel, ''The Sybil in Her Grave,'' which deals with insider stock trading and corporate takeovers, will be published in June by Delacorte Press.         The incisiveness of her legal points won her admirers among members of the profession, including Robert Bork (who was once quoted as saying, ''In my opinion, there can't be too many Sarah Caudwell novels''), while the gleeful savagery of her satiric style made her a darling of the critics. Newgate Callendar, in The New York Times Book Review, praised her for writing ''in a kind of English that has not been around since the days of Oscar Wilde.''         Sarah Caudwell was born May 27, 1939, to the author and journalist Claud Cockburn and his wife, Jean Ross, the actress and writer who was Christopher Isherwood's model for Sally Bowles in his Berlin stories and the musical ''Cabaret.'' Ms. Caudwell chose the surname Caudwell because it was a family name. She is survived by her half-brothers, the political writers Alexander, Andrew and Patrick Cockburn.         Her family ''recognized how much of Sarah there was in her characters,'' Andrew Cockburn said. ''There are certain aspects of Hilary Tamar, certain eccentricities, that are pure Sarah, although not Sarah's pipe-smoking. And, of course, that acuity of mind. Sarah had this incredibly sharp brain, which was evidenced by her success at both navigating and portraying what someone in Oliver Cromwell's Parliament once called 'the tortuous, ungodly jungle of English law.' ''         She graduated from Aberdeen University and received her law degree at St. Ann's College, Oxford. When she arrived there, the Oxford Union, a prestigious debating society, was still closed to women, said Andrew Cockburn. She led the fight that changed that, and she made her point at one off-limits event that she attended dressed as a man. Her disguise was discovered and she was ejected, but ultimately won the war.         She joined the Chancery bar in 1966 and worked in property and tax law. When she joined Lloyds Bank, she became a senior executive in the trust department.         ''As a woman, she had to have had a first-class mind to join the Chancery bar, to have built up a successful practice and to have become a senior executive at Lloyds,'' said a friend and fellow barrister, John Tackebury. ''All these institutions were highly resistant to women at a senior level, and certainly to a woman who smoked a pipe.''       
         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Barbara Cooney, an author and illustrator of children's books whose first work was published in 1940 and whose 110th, ''Basket Moon,'' appeared last fall, died on Friday at a hospital in Portland, Me. She was 83 and lived in Damariscotta, Me.         Miss Cooney honored the admonition she ascribed to her best-loved character, Miss Rumphius, who said, ''You must do something to make the world more beautiful.''         She won the Caldecott Medal for illustration twice, first in 1958 for a version of Chaucer's ''Chanticleer and the Fox'' in full color in the scratchboard technique she had been using for roughly 20 years. Her second Caldecott, in 1980, was for paintings for Donald Hall's ''Ox-Cart Man'' that were in a distinctive primitive folk art style.         Each prize changed the artistic course of her career. After the first she began to paint, and after the second she began to write her own stories to illustrate, including what she retrospectively called a trilogy -- ''Miss Rumphius'' (1982), ''Island Boy'' (1988) and ''Hattie and the Wild Waves'' (1990). They made up what she said was ''as close to any autobiography as I will ever get.''         She was born in 1917 at the Hotel Bossert in Brooklyn Heights, which was built by her maternal grandfather. ''Hattie and the Wild Waves'' describes in detail her artist mother's childhood in a wealthy German-American family.         Miss Cooney grew up on Long Island and began summering in Maine at age 2. She graduated from Smith College in 1938 and studied lithography and etching at the Art Students League in New York.         She married Dr. Charles Talbot Porter and reared four children while he practiced medicine in Pepperell, Mass., later moving to a house overlooking the sea in Damariscotta.         The somewhat awed narrator of ''Miss Rumphius'' describes her great-aunt as ''little and old'' but adds, ''she has not always been that way.'' Miss Rumphius is also known as the Lupine Lady because, after an adventurous life, she has returned to the Maine coast, where she harvests and scatters the seeds of her favorite plant. ''Island Boy'' tells the story of Matthais Tibbetts, who lived almost his entire life on a remote Maine island.         Maine, the much-loved scene of many of Miss Cooney's books, treasured the author in turn. In 1989 the Maine Library Association created the Lupine Award to honor outstanding children's books by state residents or authors of books about Maine, beginning with Miss Cooney, and in 1996 Gov. Angus King proclaimed her a Living Treasure of the State of Maine. In 1997 Miss Cooney announced a donation of $550,000 to the library in Damariscotta, and later added $300,000. Groundbreaking for a library costing $2 million will be next month.         Miss Cooney received many honorary degrees and won numerous awards in addition to the Caldecotts, including the American Book Award for ''Miss Rumphius'' in 1983.         In addition to her husband and four children, she is survived by two brothers, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.         Miss Cooney's work is much admired for its historical detail and accuracy, from the embroidery on Eleanor Roosevelt's baptismal gown (''Eleanor'') to details of Finnish folklore (''Louhi, Witch of North Farm'').         In her 1959 Caldecott acceptance speech she explained: ''How many children will know that the magpie sitting in my pollarded willow in 'Chanticleer and the Fox' is an evil omen? How many children will realize that every flower and grass in the book grew in Chaucer's time in England? How many children will know or care? Maybe not a single one. Still I keep piling it on. Detail after detail. Whom am I pleasing -- besides myself? I don't know. Yet if I put enough in my pictures, there may be something for everyone. Not all will be understood, but some will be understood now and maybe more later.''       
         Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral, chamber and vocal music, died on Monday at the Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was 86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years. Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980's her shorter works were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.         Ms. Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.         In the mid-1930's Ms. Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ''The Race of Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ''Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles Weidman and ''Tragic Exodus'' and ''They Too Are Exiles'' (both 1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ''Alcestis'' (1960) for Graham and ''My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.         Ms. Fine's symphonic works include ''Elegiac Song'' for muted strings (1937) and ''Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano, baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).         As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from 1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of her operas, ''The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings. Her last major work, ''The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and Ruth Crawford Seeger.         Still, Ms. Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by their sex. ''I hope the term 'woman composer' will be dropped soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989. ''I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk of 'poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists -- singers, pianists, violinists -- have been accepted for a long time.''         Ms. Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and Bennington College in Vermont.         She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of North Bennington, Vt.         Correction:  March 28, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the composer Vivian Fine on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her husband, Benjamin Karp of Hoosick Falls, N.Y.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Janet Reed, whose comic gifts and sparkling technique made her one of American dance's most beloved ballerinas in the early years of American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, died in Seattle last Monday. She was 83 and lived in Seattle.         She suffered a stroke one week earlier, said Maren Erskine, her daughter-in-law.         A petite redhead whose vivacious energy delighted audiences in both story ballets and pure-dance works, Ms. Reed was San Francisco Ballet's leading ballerina from 1937 to 1941 before joining Ballet Theater in 1942 and City Ballet in 1949.         She was a member of Eugene Loring's experimental chamber company, Dance Players, in 1942. In 1974 she helped found the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, remaining for two years as its first artistic director.         A member of the original cast of Jerome Robbins's first ballet, ''Fancy Free,'' Ms. Reed became associated with a memorable role and the kind of all-American image that audiences identified with her dancing. When Robbins created ''Fancy Free'' for Ballet Theater in 1944 he cast her as the young woman who dances a romantic duet with a sailor in a bar during World War II and then wipes her lipstick off his face.         By then Ms. Reed had also performed the ballerina roles in the 19th-century classics in San Francisco. These included Willam Christensen's 1940 staging of ''Swan Lake,'' the ballet's first full-length American production. As Lincoln Kirstein noted in his book ''Movement and Metaphor,'' Ms. Reed was an excellent comedian but also a classical dancer.         Kirstein and George Balanchine founded City Ballet in 1948 and Balanchine invited Ms. Reed into the company a few months later. He quickly cast her in his signature Neo-Classical ballets, including ''Symphony in C'' and ''Serenade.''         In 1949 he choreographed ''Bourree Fantasque,'' whose final exuberant section exploited the vitality and virtuosity that made up Ms. Reed's trademark style.         In the 1940's and 50's City Ballet was a very different company than it is today. Balanchine continued to develop a plotless Neo-Classical genre, but the repertory was eclectic, drawing upon a variety of choreographers. Robbins, like Ms. Reed, had transferred from Ballet Theater and become associate artistic director in 1949. Ms. Reed had danced in the 1945 premiere of ''Interplay,'' Robbins's enduring mix of bravura and blues, and he continued to use her.         Comic ballets, even by Balanchine, were not a rarity at City Ballet and in this realm Ms. Reed was queen. In Balanchine's ''A la Francaix,'' Ms. Reed was a belle who lost her swain, Andre Eglevsky, to a sylph, Maria Tallchief. In ''The Pied Piper,'' by Robbins, Ms. Reed led a jiving pack after a clarinetist onstage. She was the droopy Hortense, queen of the Waterlilies in Ruthanna Boris's ''Cakewalk,'' a comic gloss on minstrel shows.         In City Ballet's 1953 revival of Lew Christensen's ''Filling Station,'' a bit of 1938 Americana, Ms. Reed danced opposite the young Jacques d'Amboise as a gas station attendant. She was in her element as a tipsy debutante. When Balanchine created ''Western Symphony'' Ms. Reed made his satire of a classical adagio a lesson in strong technique and projection.         John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, devoted an article to Ms. Reed in 1954: ''Janet Reed is adorable, all right, and that unquestionably brings a great many customers to the box office; but she is also an artist of very high attainments, and a performer among performers.''         Ms. Reed was born in Tolo, Ore., and studied ballet with Willam Christensen in Portland, Ore., and San Francisco.         Although repeatedly praised for her comic timing and engaging characterization, Ms. Reed had an extensive dramatic range that she displayed in Antony Tudor's psychological ballets and Michael Kidd's ''On Stage!'' at Ballet Theater.         After marrying Branson Erskine, an interior designer, she appeared in the Robbins musical ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing'' in 1947. She is survived by a son, Reed Erskine of New York, and a daughter, Jane Erskine of Seattle.         Ms. Reed returned to Ballet Theater briefly before joining City Ballet, where she danced until 1958 and then was its ballet mistress until 1961. She taught in several colleges before moving to Seattle, where she also staged dances for the Seattle Opera. In 1983 she and Gene Kelly were the hosts of a gala celebrating the San Francisco Ballet's 50th anniversary.       
         Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, an author whose ability to recreate the sensibilities of a child informed many well-loved books she wrote for young readers, died on March 1 at her home in Washington. She was 86.         Beni Montresor illustrated Mrs. de Regniers's ''May I Bring a Friend?'' (1972) and won the Caldecott Medal for the pictures that accompany the story of a boy who politely asks a king and queen for permission before bringing his animal friends along when he is asked to visit. Mrs. de Regniers's other books included ''A Little House of Your Own'' (1954), illustrated by Irene Haas, and ''Little Sister and the Month Brothers'' (1975), illustrated by Margot Tomes.         ''What Can You Do With a Shoe?,'' an engaging conversation between two children, was illustrated by Maurice Sendak in 1955 using two colors. It was republished in 1997 with full-color illustrations by Mr. Sendak.         Mrs. de Regniers was born in Lafayette, Ind., and raised in nearby Crawfordsville, a place where, she wrote, a child could ''gather violets, live in a tree, walk in the woods -- be.'' She earned degrees from the University of Chicago and the Winnetka Graduate Teachers College.         She was a social worker and a dancer and during World War II a welfare officer with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. For 11 years she was director of educational materials for the American Heart Association before becoming the founding editor of Scholastic's Lucky Book Club in 1961. She retired from that position in 1981.         In an essay Mrs. de Regniers explained the deceptively simple style of her children's books, saying that ''a book for young people that honestly has its roots in the author's feelings as a child is not likely to seem old-fashioned or out of date.''         Under the pseudonym Tamara Kitt (Tammy and Mara were her cats' names), Mrs. de Regniers also wrote a series of mass-market paperbacks, including ''Jake'' and ''Sam and the Impossible Thing.''         She was married to Francis de Regniers, who worked as a manager  for Air France, and they lived in New York until his death in 1992. She later moved to Washington to be near her sister, Lillian Goldman of Washington, who survives her.         When schoolchildren asked if she had children of her own, Mrs. de Regniers explained that she had vivid memories of her childhood. ''I remember 'way back,'' she would say, ''even before I was 2 years old,'' adding that ''almost everything I write relates in some way to these early years. What was important to me then is important to me now.         ''That is why, even though I have no children of my own, I think it is O.K. for me to write books that children will read or have read to them.''       
         Gisele Freund, the German-born photographer who was best known for her portraits of France's literary elite and was a founding member of Magnum Photo Agency, died today in Paris. She was 91.         Ms. Freund was one of Europe's most prominent photographers and a pillar among French feminist intellectuals after fleeing Nazi Germany and settling in Paris in the 1930's.         In the course of her long career, she went on about 80 photographic assignments around the world, mainly for Time and Life. But she is most noted for being in a lot of places with a lot of famous people.         She captured a windblown Andre Malraux on a Paris rooftop, Boris Pasternak, Aldous Huxley and Andre Gide at a congress for the defense of culture; Walter  Benjamin sitting on a bench in the Bibliotheque Nationale; Vladimir Nabokov, Michel Leiris, Henri Michaux and Jean Paulhan in the editorial offices of the magazine Mesures and James Joyce playing the piano for his son, Giorgio.         She specialized in conveying the attitude of her subjects. She focused on hands, body posture and clothing. Reviewing an exhibition of her life's work in 1979, Hilton Kramer wrote in The New York Times that she excelled in ''brilliant documentation rather than originality.''         In a 1996 interview, Ms. Freund said she read her subjects' work and often spent hours discussing their books with them before taking a portrait.         ''This was essential to gaining their confidence,'' she said of Sartre, de Beauvoir, Malraux and Breton. ''I tell many young photographers to do the same thing, but so often they don't want to read about their subjects, they just want to take pictures. For me, at least, studying my subjects first and knowing them personally was essential to taking a good picture.''         Born in Berlin in 1908 to wealthy Jewish parents who collected art, Ms. Freund was given her first camera at the age of 12. As a university student studying sociology in Frankfurt, she became a political activist protesting the rise of Hitler's National Socialism. In 1933 she fled Germany, escaping just as the police were about to arrest her.         She arrived in Paris carrying only a small suitcase, a camera and some film recording the early stages of Nazi violence. She pursued her doctoral studies at the Sorbonne, where her thesis on photography in France in the 19th century met with some skepticism because photography was not considered a serious study.         She used her camera to make a living. But what began as economic necessity rapidly developed into a serious vocation. Although still living the life of a refugee who had become stateless, by 1936 she had scored a double triumph.         Her dissertation was published as a book by Adrienne Monnier, the Paris bookseller who stood at the center of French literary life in the period between the two world wars. And the first of her picture stories was published by the new Life magazine.         Ms. Monnier, whom Ms. Freund met while browsing in her Left Bank bookshop,  became her lifelong mentor and companion, introducing her to the Parisian intellectual set and encouraging her to pursue photography.         Her use of color clashed with the prevailing style of retouched black-and-white studio portraits, but she persevered, saying that color was ''closer to life.''         The Nazi invasion of France in 1940 interrupted her career and she fled again,  first to southern France and then to Argentina, where she worked until the war's end.  In later years Ms. Freund became well known in her adopted France, winning the National Grand Prize for Photography in 1980. She took the official photograph of  Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, at his presidential inauguration in 1981.         But she gave up photography in the mid-1980's, saying she wanted to spend her  time reading. Her modest Paris apartment did not have a single photograph on the walls, but there were piles of books.         In a statement, President Jacques Chirac praised her today as ''one of the world's greatest photographers.''         ''She was able, better than anyone, to reveal the essence of beings through their expressions,'' he said.         Prime Minister Lionel Jospin hailed Ms. Freund as an ''unparalleled sociologist and reporter who traveled the world with a generous and lucid approach to places and events faraway.''         Her agent, Nina Beskow, said that Ms. Freund had been briefly married ''for paper reasons.'' There were no immediate survivors.         Ms. Freund's portrait of Malraux on the rooftop -- wrapped in a trench coat with a cigarette dangling from his mouth -- is among her most best-known photographs. But when the portrait was adapted for a French postage stamp, the cigarette was famously airbrushed out, in a nod to the times.       
         Barbara Cartland, whose outpouring of more than 700 romance novels during seven decades made her the undisputed queen of a genre for hundreds of millions of readers the world over, died yesterday at her home near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, England. She was 98.         Throughout her professional life, Dame Barbara possessed a most uncommon ability: she was able to turn out 50,000-word novels at the rate of two a month. During the 1980's, when she was hardly young, she routinely produced 23 titles a year. With all of it she still managed to live the good life in Camfield Place, her gracious 400-acre estate in Hertfordshire,  with Twi-Twi, her Pekingese, and with her white Rolls-Royce ever at the ready, a pink mohair rug neatly folded in the back seat, there to keep guests comfortable when they were driven to her home from the station.         And although her name may not have been taken seriously by the more serious students of comparative literature or by the subscribers to literary supplements, about one billion copies of her 723 books were printed and sold in 36 languages.  Bantam and Jove Publications were among her several American publishers.         She has appeared in The Guinness Book of Records as the world's best-selling author, breaking records for 18 years.         In a century in which so many writers struggled against censorship laws for the right to describe a variety of sexual activities in explicit terms, Dame Barbara's prose remained dedicated to an unlikely celebration of the adventures of passionate virgins.         ''People don't roll around naked in my books,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I do allow them to go to bed if they're married, but it's all very wonderful and the moon beams.''         It was the way to sustain an approach to fiction writing that remained essentially unchanged from the early 1920's to the end of her days. She was totally convinced of its appropriateness. When it was suggested that she could be a tad more risque, she replied, ''You can't get more naked than naked, can you, and then where do you go from there?''         Her virgin heroines were typically fresh as April's peach blossoms. They were always wide-eyed, idealistic and impecunious, as demure as they were determined to struggle against all manner of vicissitudes in their quest to find Mr. Right.         He, in turn, was invariably a dark, square-jawed chap, perhaps with bulging biceps, incessantly given to splendid thoughts despite his worldliness. He was furthermore possessed of that indefinable magnetism that seems to surround men who have an enormous bankroll, a title and all the connections needed to keep good women out of harm's way forever.         Dame Barbara never asked anything of her heroines that she didn't ask of herself. Although twice married and the mother of three, she did not really like being kissed or touched, wrote a biographer with whom she cooperated, Gwen Robyns. ''It was part of the strange complex which meant she was a virgin not only physically but also mentally and spiritually,'' Ms. Robyns wrote in 1985.         The process by which a man and a woman found each other usually occurred in Regency, Victorian or Georgian times, and before they got to live happily ever after, her characters said things like, ''Oh, Miss, there is evil in this house,'' or, ''My son will never marry; I am his life.''         Her narrative style provided ample cement for such dialogue.         ''All she knew was that she was close against him and he was kissing her wildly, passionately, demandingly and the world stood still,'' she wrote in ''Fire in the Blood,'' published in 1983. ''He kissed her until he carried her as he had before up the peak of Olympus, and they were no longer human but one with the gods.'' Even with stuff as racy as this, readers came away thinking that her heroines remained as untouched as they had been in Chapter 1.         ''My heroines are always virgins,'' the writer said in 1973. ''They never go to bed without a ring on their fingers; not until page 118 at least.'' She also asserted that her notion of a truly sexy man was one who was ''fully clothed and preferably in uniform.''         People who watched Dame Barbara in action were not sure how she produced so much work. She wrote so quickly that even her fans were not always in agreement as to how many titles she had produced at any given time. Since mere typewriters could never keep up with her, she neatly avoided them and dictated her fiction to awestruck assistants who wrote furiously, backed up by tape recorders.         She was frequently able to dictate 7,000 words in an afternoon session, which usually lasted a few hours. She held forth from a sofa, a hot water bottle at her feet, her dog cuddled next to her, asleep. Her secretaries were not permitted to sneeze or cough while she dictated.         Perhaps in part because of her approach to dictating, her prose offers a prodigious number of one-sentence paragraphs, closer in its look to wire-service journalism than to the pages of Faulkner or Fitzgerald. In addition to her books she wrote some 30 plays. Asked why she wrote so much, she replied, ''I wanted the money.'' On other occasions, however, she denounced society's materialism, if not her own.         Barbara Hamilton Cartland was born in Warwickshire County, England, on July 9, 1901, the daughter of Bertram Cartland and Nancy H. Scobell Cartland, who was better known as Polly. Mr. Cartland was handsome and charming and came from a prominent family. But he could never have been the prototype for the novels his daughter would write. He was not a very good provider, and when his father's fortune was lost, forcing the family members to sell their house, it was Polly Cartland who led them into a home far less commodious than the one they had lost. The new one she rented offered only six bedrooms, a tennis court, stables and a garden that nobody had tended lately.         ''Poor I may be, but common I am not,'' Polly said, sounding not unlike the heroines her daughter would later create. The Cartlands made do, and young Barbara and her two brothers spent their formative years this way, learning to play tiddlywinks and other games. By the time she was 19, Dame Barbara said, she had rejected four proposals of marriage.         After she completed finishing school, she turned to writing and produced her first novel, ''Jigsaw,'' in 1922 when she was 21. It did not get good reviews -- one critic called it a ''modern feverish novel of the amateur'' -- but it went into six editions and was translated into five languages.         She married Alexander McCorquodale in 1927. He was a rich Scotsman widely known as an accomplished salmon fisherman. They were divorced five years later, and although she said she did not like the McCorquodale family much, she married Hugh McCorquodale, Alexander's cousin, in 1936. This marriage lasted until Hugh's death in 1963.         In addition to her writing, Dame Barbara found time to support many charities, promote aviation and work to improve the plight of pensioners and the acceptance of Gypsies in England. She was also credited with popularizing a swimming pool on the roof of the Hotel Piccadilly in London. She tried her hand at designing wallpaper and lent her name to a perfume. The perfume venture was unsuccessful, she said, because the perfume was not expensive enough.         In 1950 she moved into Camfield Place, a palace built in 1867, in which Beatrix Potter wrote ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' at the turn of the century. In 1991 she was made a Dame of the British Empire. She said she was sure the honor was not for her contributions to literature but for her efforts of behalf of charities and the Gypsies.         Dame Barbara is survived by a daughter, Raine, Countess Spencer, who was the stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales; and two sons, Ian and Hugh McCorquodale.         Dame Barbara was steadfast in her belief in vitamins -- at one point she took 78 a day -- and in yoga, clairvoyance, fruit sugar, ginseng, garlic and honey. She wrote so convincingly that honey was an aphrodisiac in ''The Magic of Honey,'' published in 1970, that a temporary shortage was created in Britain.         She had no use for smoking, white bread, white sugar and most forms of alcohol, but she drank brandy when she visited New York in 1981 because, she said, she could taste chlorine in the water.       
         Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to the furs she designed for the music world's most tireless clotheshorses, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal. She was 37.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.         For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was almost unknown in the fashion world, Ms. Battle had a large following. Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make trousers for him in black sheared mink.         And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's ''Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella Versace, it was Ms. Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige, who had on a turquoise fur chubby.         Ms. Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense, she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had relatives in North Carolina, and Ms. Battle, who was part Tuscarora Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.         After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Ms. Battle started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.         ''When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines, they'd say to the stylists, 'I'm wearing my own coat,' '' recalled her sister. They meant, of course, Ms. Battle's furs. She also created coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made identical styles for their wives and children.         Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne, burgundy and green, projected a high urban style -- what Mr. Talley called ''a ghetto fabulousness'' -- that not only appealed to Ms. Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked the 1970's in fashion. She was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of reviving that era.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother, Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.       
         Thea Porter, one of the earliest  among British fashion designers who rode hippie chic to high visibility, if not always to enduring commercial success, died on Monday in London. She was 72.         Well before globalization became a fashion cliche, Ms. Porter was deploying the concept in her own canny rendition of it. Beginning in 1967, from a series of shops located in unlikely quarters of London and Paris, and later at I. Magnin in San Francisco and Giorgio of Beverly Hills, she made and sold clothes whose inspiration was drawn from her far-ranging travels and a childhood spent as the half-French, half-English daughter of a missionary posted to the Middle East.         Ms. Porter dressed Elizabeth Taylor for the souk, put the socialite Dalitha Getty in caftans and created Symbolist-inspired costumes for a perpetual party centered on the Rolling Stones and their newly made friends from the British aristocracy.         Her specialty was in finding exceptional fabrics -- Swiss chiffons, Indian handprints, 1930's French voiles uncovered in warehouses -- and deploying them voluminously for a clientele undaunted by the extravagance of both her silhouettes and her fees. A gypsy costume Ms. Porter made for Begum Aga Khan to wear to a fancy dress ball given by Baron Alexis de Rede was lavish enough that her fellow Briton, the designer Hardy Amies, described it as ''pre-guillotine.''         Born in Jerusalem on Dec. 24, 1927, Dorothea Noelle Naomi Porter was raised in Damascus, Syria, and briefly attended the Royal Holloway College in London, until she was expelled because, she once explained, ''I wanted to study art.'' Although her art studies were equally short-lived, a job as a librarian in Beirut eventually resulted in her marriage, in 1953, to Robert Porter, an economist attached to the British Embassy in Lebanon. As a diplomat's wife in the early 60's, Ms. Porter traveled to Iran and Jordan, spent holidays in Italy and France and, as she once said, ''went to nightclubs every night and had millions of clothes.''         The marriage dissolved in 1964, and Ms. Porter began a fashion career with textiles collected during her travels. By good fortune, the prevailing style of the moment was High Ethnic. Clients at her Moroccan-inspired shop on Greek Street in London included not only rock stars but also members of a nascent jet set whose style reflected their newfound nomadism. She attired both Jayne Wrightsman, the wife of the oil industrialist Charles Wrightsman, and the actress Jane Fonda as if for a visit to a caravanserai in Kabul.         ''Her real contribution was introducing ethnic clothes for that late 60's, rich hippie period,'' said the fashion designer Zandra Rhodes. It was a period, Ms. Rhodes said, ''of shawls and prints and unusual textiles that you might have seen on the Beatles or the Mamas and Papas,'' or the titled people who indulged their escapist fantasies with what one critic referred to as Ms. Porter's ''peacockerie.''         In 1971 Michael Butler, the producer of ''Hair'' on Broadway, financed a shop for Ms. Porter in New York. When the enterprise failed, Ms. Porter returned to England and turned her hand to decoration. Her store, Thea Porter Decorations, eventually went into receivership; she later formed a brief partnership in a smaller store with Princess Dina of Jordan. ''Sadly, one didn't hear of her after that,'' said Ms. Rhodes.         After a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, Ms. Porter moved from her Mayfair apartment to a nursing home in Kensington, where she died.         She is survived by a daughter, Venetia.       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Lucille Fletcher, who transfixed a national audience with her radio drama ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' on CBS's ''Suspense'' in 1943, died on Thursday in Langhorne, Pa. She was 88 and lived in Oxford, Md.         Besides her radio plays, Miss Fletcher was the author of novels, stage plays and screenplays, but she was best known for ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' a 22-minute thriller first broadcast on May 25, 1943.         It concerns Leona Stevenson, a bedridden neurotic who, thanks to a crossed telephone wire, overhears two men plotting a woman's murder. After making fruitless calls to the police, she discovers that the intended victim is herself.         The drama, starring Agnes Moorehead in a virtual monologue with sound effects, proved so popular that it was broadcast nationally seven times from 1943 to 1948 and was ultimately translated into 15 languages, including Zulu.         In 1948 Miss Fletcher adapted it for a film that starred Barbara Stanwyck, whose performance earned an Academy Award nomination. ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' also won an Edgar from the Mystery Writers of America, inspired two operas and was remade for cable television in 1989 with Loni Anderson.         Miss Fletcher once described ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' as an experiment in radio sound effects. ''I grew up in an era when the radio was a wonderful medium for the imagination,'' she said. ''You could get any effect you wanted with sounds.''         Her daughter Dorothy Herrmann said Miss Fletcher got the idea for the drama after an obnoxious well-dressed woman refused to permit her to go ahead on a supermarket checkout line on Manhattan's East Side when Miss Fletcher was buying some milk or cereal for one of her children, who was sick.         ''No, you cannot,'' the woman said. ''How dare you?''         The drama, Ms. Herrmann said, was Miss Fletcher's act of revenge.         Miss Fletcher's more than 20 radio plays also included ''Hitchhiker,'' an eerie drama about a man who keeps seeing the same hitchhiker as he drives to California. Orson Welles starred as the driver, and the haunting score was written by Bernard Herrmann, Miss Fletcher's first husband, best known for his score for Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho.''         In the late 1950's Miss Fletcher began writing novels. ''Blindfold,'' in which a psychoanalyst is virtually kidnapped by the government to treat a nuclear physicist in such secrecy that he is not allowed to see his patient or hear any identifiable details of his life, was made into a 1966 film that starred Rock Hudson and Claudia Cardinale. Among Miss Fletcher's other novels were ''And Presumed Dead,'' ''The Strange Blue Yawl,'' ''The Girl in Cabin B54'' and ''Eighty Dollars to Stamford.''         In 1972 Joan Hackett and Len Cariou starred on Broadway in Miss Fletcher's ''Night Watch,'' about a New York heiress who has witnessed a murder but cannot prove it. In The New York Times the critic Clive Barnes called ''Night Watch'' a superior thriller, ''which from its first blood-curdling scream to its last charming surprise is a first-class example of its genre.'' In 1973 it was made into a film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey.         Miss Fletcher, who was born in Brooklyn in 1912, wanted to be a writer from childhood. In 1933 she graduated from Vassar College, where she was a fierce, friendly competitor for literary prizes with her classmate Mary McCarthy.         Employed by CBS in the depths of the Depression, she was a typist, music librarian and publicity writer. While typing radio plays, she decided she could master the form.         In 1939 she married Mr. Herrmann. His biographer, Steven C. Smith, said that the idea for ''Hitchhiker'' came to her when the couple were traveling in their 1940 Packard convertible to Hollywood and Miss Fletcher spotted an odd-looking man  on the Brooklyn Bridge and again on the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey. A year later, she said, ''I conceived of doing it as a ghost story.''         Miss Fletcher's marriage to Mr. Herrmann, with whom she had two daughters, ended in divorce in 1948.         In 1949 she married John Douglass  Wallop, a novelist whose ''Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant'' was adapted into the 1955 musical ''Damn Yankees.'' He died in 1985.         In 1988 William Morrow published Miss Fletcher's last novel, ''Mirror Image,'' a tale of terror and illusion.         Besides Ms. Herrmann, of New Hope, Pa., Miss Fletcher is survived by her other daughter, Wendy Harlow of Phoenix, Md.; a sister, Dr. Iris Norstrand of Brooklyn, and two grandsons.         In an interview with The Washington Post, Miss Fletcher once said: ''Writing suspense stories is like working on a puzzle. You bury the secret, lead the reader down the path, put in false leads and throughout the story remain completely logical. Each word must have meaning and be written in a fine literary style. Mysteries are a challenge, a double task for the writer, for the reader is aching to solve the puzzle before you do.''       
         Elizabeth Gordon, the influential editor of House Beautiful magazine for more than 20 years, a missionary of taste to the American homemaker and an indefatigable supporter of Frank Lloyd Wright, died on Sept. 3 in Adamstown, Md., where she lived. She was 94.         When she took over as editor of House Beautiful in 1939, Ms. Gordon was determined to educate the American public about appropriate design and new American architecture. She devoted entire issues to topics like climate control and the emerging ranch house in California.         Her ''pace setter'' issues in the late 1940's tracked and explained important trends in design to an audience just learning how to consume. In a 1953 essay, ''The Threat to the Next America,'' she railed against cultural dictatorship and the evils of ''a self-chosen elite who are trying to tell us what we should like and how we should live,'' by which she meant the followers of International-style architecture, the curators at the Museum of Modern Art and European architects like Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.         The article attracted the appreciative attention of Frank Lloyd Wright, who became a mentor and close friend.         Another influential essay in 1960, ''We Invite You to Enter a New Dimension: Shibui,'' extolled the principles of understated resonance and serenity in design and is credited with introducing traditional Japanese design ideas to the American public.         ''She was an amazingly influential editor, crusading for the softer side of contemporary design,'' said Louis Oliver Gropp, the recently retired editor in chief of House Beautiful. ''When she covered a topic she did it in staggering depth.''         Ms. Gordon was born in Logansport, Ind., attended the University of Chicago and briefly taught high school in Wisconsin. In the 1930's she moved to New York to work as a promotional copywriter for several newspapers. She used that job as a springboard to a syndicated column on home maintenance for The New York Herald Tribune, then an editorship at Good Housekeeping, where she remained for eight years.         During the Depression, she wrote a popular how-to book, ''More House for Your Money'' (Morrow).         Ms. Gordon, who always used her maiden name professionally, married Carl Hafey Norcross, a writer and expert on aviation and planned communities, and became a pilot herself. Mr. Norcross died in 1988; Ms. Gordon is survived by a sister-in-law, Gertrude Norcross of San Diego.         At House Beautiful, Ms. Gordon, who was as famous for her large hats as for her imperious taste and insatiable curiosity, once called the magazine ''a propaganda and teaching tool.'' It took her five years of research and seven trips to Japan to prepare for the special issue on shibui. In 1988, she deposited all the materials in an archive at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. Some of her other collections were donated to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.         But it was her diatribe against the International style that proved a turning point in her career. It virtually equated the style with communism, or at least a foreign architectural invasion, and warned people not to be sure that ''it can't happen here.'' Soon after it was published, she received a mysterious telegram: ''Didn't think you had it in you. Am at your service from here on.'' It was signed only ''Godfather,'' but it came from Wright.         For the rest of the 1950's, the master architect and the determined editor worked closely together. When Wright designed one of his famous Usonian houses for a retrospective exhibition, the editors of House Beautiful furnished it. She called her office ''an extension of Taliesin,'' and allowed Wright to install an apprentice architect from Taliesin as the magazine's architecture editor.         Ms. Gordon devoted two special issues to Wright, keeping the aging architect in the public eye when the eyes of critics had turned elsewhere. He always referred to himself as her Godfather, and designed a bed with built-in cabinets and a jungle motif for her and her husband.         In 1964, Ms. Gordon left the magazine world, angry with the growing intimacy between editorial content and advertising demands.         In the 1970's, she and her husband retired to Maryland and a house filled with Japanese textiles and an Otto Natzler pottery collection. From there she continued to consult and lecture widely on design matters close to her heart.         In 1972, a special issue on Scandinavian design that she had published with an accompanying exhibition that traveled the country won her the insignia of a knight, first class, in the Finnish Order of the Lion. In 1987, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. As her goddaughter Brooke Shearer Talbot said, Ms. Gordon ''wore those big pieces of metal at every opportunity.''         ''She was not afraid to stand out.''       
         Paula Yates,  a British television personality known for her outrageously flirtatious interviewing style and for her relationships with the rock stars Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence, was found dead at home here on Sunday. She was 40.         The cause was apparently a drug overdose, the authorities said.         Reared in north Wales, Ms. Yates left school at 16 and moved to London, where she joined the emerging punk scene and embarked on an extravagant -- and extravagantly public -- life. When she became enamored of Mr. Geldof, who was then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, she followed the band on tour until Mr. Geldof became just as smitten with her, and they embarked on a relationship. They married 10 years later and had three daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie.         Ms. Yates reveled in the spotlight, posing naked in the stuffy Reform Club for Penthouse magazine and compiling a book of photographs called ''Rock Stars in Their Underpants,'' which Andy Warhol called ''the greatest work of art in the last decade.'' She also wrote several books for children, but it was not until she started her television career as a co-presenter of ''The Tube,'' a show about music, that she became a celebrity in her own right, affecting a bubbleheaded, giggly personality that belied her sharp intelligence, friends said.         In 1992 she began presenting ''The Big Breakfast Show,'' a morning television program in which she often interviewed guests while lying on a bed in the studio. One guest was Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the band INXS, and the two fell madly in love. She left Mr. Geldof, setting off a bitter, tabloid-fueled divorce and an equally bitter fight for custody of their three daughters. Mr. Geldof won.         Ms. Yates and Mr. Hutchence had an intensely passionate affair and one child, a daughter they named Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. But their relationship was marred by drug use and extreme behavior that ended when Mr. Hutchence was found dead, hanging by his belt, in a hotel room in Sydney, Australia, in November 1997.         Ms. Yates, who once said that Mr. Hutchence was ''God's gift to women,'' seemed never to recover from his death, spiraling into a depression that resulted in her admission to a mental hospital and at least one suicide attempt of her own.         It was hard for her to hang on, she once said in an interview. ''It's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day,'' she said. ''Right now, I think living is a noble gesture.''       
         Jean Peters, a 20th Century Fox contract player whose unpretentious beauty earned her leading roles in some of the top films of the late 1940's and early 50's before she abandoned her career and practically disappeared from view after a secretive marriage to the billionaire Howard Hughes, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Carlsbad, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Peters, who was known as  Pete during her acting years, was a lead actress from the moment she arrived in Hollywood at the age of 21 after winning a Miss Ohio State beauty contest whose prizes included a Fox screen test.         The studio quickly offered her a seven-year contract. Within months of being driven cross-country by her widowed mother, the owner of a tourist camp outside their hometown, Canton, Ms. Peters was chosen as the female lead in the lavish epic ''Captain from Castille,'' opposite Tyrone Power.         Though never considered one of Hollywood's great actresses, the green-eyed, fresh-faced Ms. Peters had a straightforward naturalness on camera that made her a favorite leading lady of some of the top stars of the period.         She appeared with Ray Milland in the baseball comedy ''It Happens Every Spring'' (1949), and with Marlon Brando in Elia Kazan's ''Viva Zapata!'' (1952), Richard Widmark in Sam Fuller's ''Pickup on South Street'' (1953), Joseph Cotten and Marilyn Monroe in ''Niagara'' (1953), Spencer Tracy in ''Broken Lance'' (1954), Burt Lancaster in ''Apache'' (1954) and, perhaps most memorably, as one of three American women in Rome in Jean Negulesco's ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954).         Many remarked at the time on Ms. Peters's informal off-camera style,  avoiding Hollywood night life and the networking scene in the studio commissary for private picnics with her hairdresser and makeup artist on the floor of a dark set.         She was most often seen without makeup and wearing jeans and simple shirts. She lived in a rented bungalow decorated with watercolors she had painted herself. The studio publicity machine painted her as an Ohio farm girl and a bit of a tomboy baseball fan, an image that was difficult to reconcile with the sculptured beauty who appeared on the screen.         ''Back home, I still have 3 dogs, 18 cats, a goat named Josephine and a lamb called Ali Baba,'' she told an interviewer in 1948.         To another, in 1949, she remarked: ''I don't like servants or big houses, and I'd hate to waste my time playing bridge in the afternoons. I think women need to cook and sew.''         Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, Ms. Peters met and began a quiet relationship with the reclusive Hughes -- also famous for his ostentatiously unpretentious wardrobe -- and for a decade the couple dated, usually getting together once a week, often to watch movies until late into the evening in one of Hughes's screening rooms. Among his holdings at the time were RKO Studios, Trans World Airlines, Hughes Aircraft and the Hughes Tool Company.         She was rarely seen in public and never in the company of another man, though Hughes was often seen on the town with some of the top actresses of the day. Because of the long nature of their relationship, there were frequent rumors that the couple had secretly wed.         For a few months, in 1954, Ms. Peters was married to Stanley W. Cramer 3rd, a Texas oil executive, but it ended in divorce and, like all of her marriages, without children. It was in 1957 that another rumor arose of a secret wedding between Hughes and Ms. Peters. This time it was true. The couple had married in a private ceremony in Tonapah, Nev.         Ms. Peters, whose final movie was ''A Man Called Peter'' (1955), retired from film acting and was rarely seen in public during the 13 years she remained married to Hughes. Neither granted interviews.         Over the years, Ms. Peters established herself in a remote, hilltop mansion in Bel Air while her husband, growing ever more reclusive and secretive, adjourned to the penthouses above a Las Vegas casino where he passed most of the last decades of his life.         They would still get together once a week or so, usually watching movies in Hughes's sanctuary.         An acquaintance, D. L. Lyons, a writer for The Ladies' Home Journal, described Ms. Peters's cloistered life in the late 1960's when he tried to visit her. ''At that time, in 1968, very much married to Howard, she lived in splendid solitude on Bel Air Road, atop a peak of the Santa Monica Mountains, under 24-hour surveillance of guards who followed her everywhere,'' he wrote.         By 1970, with her marriage disintegrating, Ms. Peters moved to a smaller house in Beverly Hills, let the guards go and even began to appear in public, attending movie screenings and going to restaurants.         Shortly after her divorce became final in 1971 she was married for a third time, to Stanley Hough, vice president and director for production operations at 20th Century Fox. Mr. Hough died in 1996, and Ms. Peters  moved to be closer to her sister in Carlsbad, a suburb of San Diego.         According to reports at the time of her divorce from Hughes, Ms. Peters had agreed as part of the settlement not to discuss their private life together and not to return to movies, at least as long as the billionaire was alive.         In 1976, though, shortly after his death, Ms. Peters made her first screen appearances in two decades, playing roles in a television mini-series, ''Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers,'' and in a public television production of ''Winesburg, Ohio.''         In 1981 she had a role in another television film, ''Peter and Paul.''  After that, she made only rare guest appearances on television series like ''Murder, She Wrote.''         A friend, Arlen Hurwitz, once recalled how Ms. Peters reacted to the attention of fans during the height of her career in the late 1940's. ''Whenever fans stop Jean on our wanderings, she has her own patented way of handling them,'' Ms. Hurwitz said.         ''They say, 'Are you Jean Peters?' and she frowns and asks in a puzzled voice, 'Who is Jean Peters?' It always works. They go off looking bewildered and we go on about our business.''       
         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         ''I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street,'' Ms. Brooks once said. ''I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.''         In Ms. Brooks's early poetry, Chicago's vast black South Side is called Bronzeville. It was ''A Street in Bronzeville,'' her first poetry anthology, that attracted the attention of the literary establishment in 1945.         The Bronzeville poems were recommended to the editors of Harper & Row by Richard Wright, who admired her ability to capture ''the pathos of petty destinies, the whimper of the wounded, the tiny incidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problems of common prejudice.''         But it was more than Ms. Brooks's ability to write about struggling black people, particularly black women. There was also her mastery of the language of poetry.         ''Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere rhythms,'' the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the poems in ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' Calling her ''a real poet,'' Mr. Humphries said of her technique, ''There is a range of form: quatrains, free verse, ballads, sonnets -- all appropriately controlled.''         Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of ''Bronzeville'' in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more ''Negro poetry'' than Robert Frost's poetry was ''white poetry.''         Among the poems in ''Bronzeville' was ''the old-marrieds,'' a portrait of an aging couple:         But in the crowding darkness not a word did they say.         Though the pretty-coated birds had piped so lightly all         the day.         And he had seen the lovers in the little side-streets.         And she had heard the morning stories clogged with         sweets.         It was quite a time for loving. It was midnight. It was         May.         But in the crowded darkness not a word did they say.         In ''A Street in Bronzeville'' Ms. Brooks created such indelible figures as the old, alienated Matthew Cole, who could only smile at such memories as ''say, thoughts of a little boy licorice-full/Without a nickel for Sunday School,'' and Satin Legs Smith, awakening on a Sunday:         He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.         And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the         Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.         In 1946 and 1947, Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1949, she published her second volume of verse, ''Annie Allen,'' a portrait of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an experimental form she called the sonnet-ballad. ''Full of insight and wisdom and pity, technically dazzling,'' Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book Review.         ''Annie Allen'' won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949 and the following year, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in 1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.         ''That's why I am as well known as I am today,'' she said in a 1987 interview. ''Sometimes,'' she added with a smile, ''I feel that my name is Gwendolyn Pulitzer Brooks.''         Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, ''Maud Martha,'' which received scant consideration when it was published in 1953. ''Maud Martha'' traced the life of a Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity and motherhood through a series of 34 vignettes.         The reader meets Maud as a lonely, overweight girl of 7, follows her through a dreamy adolescence and finally sees her as a young newlywed living ''in a sad gray building in a cold white world,'' married to a man numbed by his struggle with white society.         But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and invidiously compared with Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In recent years, however, ''Maud Martha'' has had a rebirth, and it is now regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent themes in the works of today's female writers.         ''Bronzeville Boys and Girls,'' a collection of children's poetry, appeared in 1956, followed by two poetry collections, ''The Bean Eaters'' (1960) and ''Selected Poems'' (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the racial tensions in Little Rock in 1957.         They also noticed -- and most applauded -- a sharper colloquial style that was emerging in poems like ''We Real Cool'' from ''The Bean Eaters'':         We real cool. We         Left school. We         Lurk Late. We         Strike straight. We         Sing sin. We         Thin gin. We         Jazz June. We         Die soon.         By the early 1960's, Ms. Brooks had reached a high point in her writing career. She was regarded as a grande dame of America's black writers and an honored member of the literary elite, a sought-after teacher, a poet who was valued for her sensitive portraits of black women, her precise use of language and the universality of her work. But by the end of the decade she had transformed herself and her poetry -- a reflection of the new political dynamics that were sweeping across all the Bronzevilles of America.         Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., on June 7, 1917, but grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where she remained till she died. Her parents, David Anderson Brooks and the former Keziah Corinne Wims, encouraged her and her younger brother, Raymond, to read and take an interest in culture from an early age.         Gwendolyn began writing poetry before she was a teenager, filling composition books with ''careful rhymes'' and ''lofty meditations.'' Her mother was an enthusiastic supporter, often telling her, ''You are going to be the lady Paul Laurence Dunbar.'' Ms. Brooks published her first poem, ''Eventide,'' in American Childhood when she was 13.         Prompted by her mother, the teenager sent her poems to Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson. Mr. Hughes, who would become her friend and longtime supporter, wrote back: ''You have talent. Keep writing! You'll have a book published one day.'' Mr. Johnson also responded with encouragement, urging her to read such modern poets as Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings and T. S. Eliot. By the age of 16, Ms. Brooks had become a regular contributor to the ''Lights and Shadows'' column of The Chicago Defender, where many of her earliest poems appeared.         Three years after her graduation from the newly opened Woodrow Wilson Junior College in Chicago in 1936, Ms. Brooks married Henry L. Blakely, a young writer who later published a volume of his own poetry. They lived in Chicago for the next 30 years, divorced in 1969 but reunited in 1973. Her survivors include a daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely, and a son, Henry Blakely.         Ms. Brooks's poetry shifted noticeably in form and concern after she attended a conference of black writers at Fisk University in the spring of 1967. While there she listened to readings by Amiri Baraka, Ron Milner and other young firebrand poets. ''I felt that something new was happening,'' she later said.         Those young black writers ''seemed so proud and committed to their own people,'' she added. ''The poets among them felt that black poets should write as blacks, about blacks, and address themselves to blacks.''         She later wrote: ''If it hadn't been for these young people, these young writers who influenced me, I wouldn't know what I know about this society. By associating with them I know who I am.''         Returning to Chicago, she began a poetry workshop in her home that included members of a Chicago street gang called the Blackstone Rangers and younger poets like Sonia Sanchez, Don L. Lee and Nikki Giovanni. Much of the talk was devoted to ways of merging the concept of black art with the political concept of black power.         These currents were evident in Ms. Brooks's next volume of poetry, ''In the Mecca'' (Harper 1968). The 30-page title poem described a mother's frantic search for her missing daughter in a sprawling, decrepit building called the Mecca, which once was one of Chicago's fanciest apartment houses.         In a volume that was described by one critic as ''her declaration of independence'' from the integrationist pursuit that had previously shaped her work, Ms. Brooks wrote about the desperate and tragic lives of the inhabitants of the Mecca. She wrote from experience. Ms. Brooks worked at the real Mecca as a typist for a ''spiritual adviser'' when she was young and got to know the people in the building.         The collection also offered poems about Malcolm X and the Blackstone Rangers:         Black, raw, ready.         Sores in the city         That do not want to heal.         Ms. Brooks used clipped lines, abstract word patterns and random rhymes to capture her new radical tone and her more direct expression of social concern.         ''In the Mecca'' was nominated for a National Book Award.         Asked if the change in work signaled her emergence as a ''protest poet,'' Ms. Brooks said, ''No matter what the theme is, I still want the poem to be a poem, not just a piece of propaganda.'' Ms. Brooks reflected the change in her 1988 poem ''Winnie'':         I am tired of little tight-fisted poems sitting down to         shape perfect unimportant pieces.         Poems that cough lightly -- catch a sneeze.         This is the time for Big Poems         roaring up out of the sleaze,         poems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.         After the publication of ''In the Mecca'' Ms. Brooks left her longtime mainstream publisher, Harper & Row. ''Rio'' (1969), her next volume of poetry, was published by Broadside Press, a small, Detroit-based black company. The change, she said, reflected her desire to support struggling black publishers and the young poets they published as well as her intention to address her work to black readers.         With the new direction of her work and the lack of a major mainstream publisher, however, many of her subsequent books were brushed aside by reviewers for mainstream publications. From the 1970's to the 1990's, she published more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nearly a dozen nonfiction titles, which included two autobiographical works -- ''Report From Part One'' (1972) and ''Report From Part Two'' (1995).         Despite the lack of media attention, Ms. Brooks maintained her reputation as one of America's most respected literary figures. In 1968, she succeeded Carl Sandburg as poet laureate of Illinois. In 1976, she became the first black woman to be elected to the 250-member National Institute of Arts and Letters. She received a lifetime achievement award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989 and another from the National Book Foundation in 1994. She was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.         The Gwendolyn Brooks Chair in Black Literature and Creative Writing was established at Chicago State University in 1990, and there is a Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African-American Literature at Western Illinois University and a Gwendolyn Brooks Junior High School just south of Chicago in Harvey, Ill. She was selected by the National Endowment of the Humanities as its Jefferson Lecturer in 1994 -- ''the absolute award crown of my career,'' she said. And in 1995 she received the National Medal of Arts award.         Despite such praise, Ms. Brooks preferred to stay outside what she called ''the hollow land of fame'' and quietly live and work on the South Side.         ''All my life is not writing,'' Ms. Brooks once told an interviewer. ''My greatest interest is being involved with young people.'' To that end, she devoted much time to giving readings at schools, prisons and hospitals and attending annual poetry contests for school-age youngsters, which she sponsored, judged, and often paid for out of her own pocket.         During her later years, Ms. Brooks tempered her assessment of the young poets of the 60's who had criticized her subjectivity and attention to form. ''Many of the poets felt it was a mark of their quality, of their black and Hispanic quality, if they didn't put a lot of emphasis on technique,'' she said. Although she still sought to write poetry that was ''direct'' and appealed to ''all manner of blacks,'' she insisted on maintaining her own standards.         ''I don't want to imitate these young people,'' she said. ''I have got to find a way of writing that will accomplish my purpose but still sound Gwendolynian.''         A Gwendolyn Brooks Sampler         ''the vacant lot,'' from ''A Street in Bronzeville'' (1945):         Mrs. Corley's three-flat brick         Isn't here any more.         All done with seeing her fat little form         Burst out of the basement door;         And with seeing her African son-in-law         (Rightful heir to the throne)         With his great white strong cold squares of teeth         And his little eyes of stone;         And with seeing the squat fat daughter         Letting in the men         When majesty has gone for the day --         And letting them out again.         ''The Egg Boiler,'' from ''The Bean Eaters'' (1961):         Being you, you cut your poetry from wood.         The boiling of an egg is heavy art.         You come upon it as an artist should,         With rich-eyed passion and with straining heart.         We fools, we cut our poems out of air,         Night color, wind soprano, and such stuff.         And sometimes weightlessness is much to bear.         You mock it, though, you name it Not Enough.         The egg, spooned gently to the avid pan,         And left the strict three minutes, or the four,         Is your Enough and art for any man.         We fools give courteous ear -- then cut some more,         Shaping a gorgeous Nothingness from the cloud.         You watch us, eat your egg, and laugh aloud.       
         Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         ''I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street,'' Ms. Brooks once said. ''I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.''         In Ms. Brooks's early poetry, Chicago's vast black South Side is called Bronzeville. It was ''A Street in Bronzeville,'' her first poetry anthology, that attracted the attention of the literary establishment in 1945.         The Bronzeville poems were recommended to the editors of Harper & Row by Richard Wright, who admired her ability to capture ''the pathos of petty destinies, the whimper of the wounded, the tiny incidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problems of common prejudice.''         But there was more to Ms. Brooks's talent than the ability to write about struggling black people, particularly women. There was also her mastery of poetry.         ''Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere rhythms,'' the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the poems in ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' Calling her ''a real poet,'' Mr. Humphries said of her technique, ''There is a range of form: quatrains, free verse, ballads, sonnets -- all appropriately controlled.''         Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of ''Bronzeville'' in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more ''Negro poetry'' than Robert Frost's poetry was ''white poetry.''         Among the poems in ''Bronzeville' was ''the old-marrieds,'' about an aging couple:         But in the crowding darkness not a word did they say.         Though the pretty-coated birds had piped so lightly all         the day.         And he had seen the lovers in the little side-streets.         And she had heard the morning stories clogged with         sweets.         It was quite a time for loving. It was midnight. It was         May.         But in the crowded darkness not a word did they say.         In ''A Street in Bronzeville'' Ms. Brooks created indelible figures like the old, alienated Matthew Cole, who could only smile at such memories as, ''say, thoughts of a little boy licorice-full/Without a nickel for Sunday School,'' and Satin Legs Smith, awakening on a Sunday:         He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.         And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the         Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.         In 1946 and 1947 Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1949  she published her second volume of verse, ''Annie Allen,'' a portrait of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an experimental form she called the sonnet-ballad. ''Full of insight and wisdom and pity, technically dazzling,'' Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book Review.         ''Annie Allen'' won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949 and the following year was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in 1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.         ''That's why I am as well known as I am today,'' she said in a 1987 interview. ''Sometimes,'' she added with a smile, ''I feel that my name is Gwendolyn Pulitzer Brooks.''         Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, ''Maud Martha,'' which received scant consideration when it was published in 1953. ''Maud Martha'' traced the life of a Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity through a series of 34 vignettes.         The reader meets Maud as a lonely, overweight girl of 7, follows her through a dreamy adolescence and finally sees her as a young newlywed living ''in a sad gray building in a cold white world,'' married to a man numbed by his struggle with white society.         But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and invidiously compared with Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In recent years, however, ''Maud Martha'' has had a rebirth, and it is now regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent themes in the works of women writing today.         ''Bronzeville Boys and Girls,'' a collection of children's poetry, appeared in 1956, followed by two poetry collections, ''The Bean Eaters'' (1960) and ''Selected Poems'' (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the racial tensions in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.         They also noticed -- and most applauded -- a sharper colloquial style that was emerging in poems like ''We Real Cool'' from ''The Bean Eaters'':         We real cool. We         Left school. We         Lurk Late. We         Strike straight. We         Sing sin. We         Thin gin. We         Jazz June. We         Die soon.
