         Amelia Opdyke Jones, an artist who made the "Subway Sun" posters for the New York City Transit Authority for 20 years, died on Thursday at her home in Sea Girt, N.J. She was 80.         The cause was respiratory complications, said her son, William.         Mrs. Jones's drawings, which she signed "Oppy," were first published in Life magazine in the 1930's. She also drew a syndicated comic strip, "The Young Idear.         The "Subway Sun" posters, which appeared in subway cars and buses in New York City in the 1940's and 50's, portrayed places of interest and promoted good behavior by users of the transit system.         Mrs. Jones's husband, William J. Jones, died in 1965.         In addition to her son, of Sea Girt, she is survived by a daughter, Margaretta J. Friday of Weston, Conn., four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Katharine Reynolds Cooke Greeff, a child psychologist, died on Dec. 26 in her home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She was 93.         Her family said the cause was a heart attack.         Mrs. Greeff was born in New Jersey.  She graduated from Wellesley College and held a master's degree in child psychology from Vassar College. She founded the Hill and Hollow Farm, a boarding school for children, in Hyde Park, L.I., in 1933 and operated it until 1950.         She was a past vice chairman of the Hospitality Committee for United Nations Delegations in New York, a volunteer group for which she worked from 1954 till 1970. She organized and served as chairman of the Dutchess County branch of the Foreign Policy Association and formerly directed the information center for voluntary organizations at the Woodrow Wilson Foundation.         Mrs. Greeff is survived by her daughter, Anne M. Garrigue of Manhattan; her son, Paul Garrigue of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Evangeline Greeff Michell of Westport, Conn., and three grandchildren.       
         Joan Avnet, an art collector, dealer and philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter Rosalind Avnet Lazarus.         Mrs. Avnet was the widow of Lester Avnet, founder of Avnet Inc., a distributor of electronics components. As collectors, the Avnets focused primarily on Old Master and Modern drawings, assembling major holdings in 20th-century drawings by European and American artists. Of the 900 works they acquired between 1960 and Mr. Avnet's death in 1970, 180 drawings were donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1978.         Formed in consultation with the museum, the gift collection came to include theatrical drawings by Jim Dine, early drawings by Picasso and others by Jean Dubuffet, Lionel Feininger, Jackson Pollock, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele and Leon Bakst. They also gave the museum drawings by Balthus, Chagall, Matisse, Modigliani and Rouault.  Other Gifts         The Avnets also made gifts to the Institute of Molecular Biology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Joan and Lester Avnet Division of Laboratories at the North Shore University Hospital and the Joan and Lester Avnet Chair in Ethics at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         In the 1960's Mrs. Avnet owned a gallery in Great Neck, L.I., and later was a private art dealer in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Avnet was born in New York and attended Hunter College. Her second marriage, to Dr. Karl Fischbach, ended in divorce.         In addition to Mrs. Lazarus, of New York and Washington, she is survived by another daughter, Carole Avnet Rocherolle of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Jonathan Avnet, a film director and producer of Topanga Canyon, outside Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.       
         May Nora Shea, a volunteer worker and supporter of diverse causes, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai South Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was a respiratory ailment, her family said.         Mrs. Shea was a native of Brooklyn and attended Trinity College in Washington. In 1937 she married William A. Shea, a New York lawyer who became a partner in Shea & Gould, founded the Mets baseball team and for whom Shea Stadium is named. Mr. Shea died in 1991 after 54 years of marriage.         Mrs. Shea, known to her family and friends as Nori, was involved in such causes as the National Center for Disability Services, the Foundation for Children with Learning Disabilities, Catholic Charities, Little League Baseball and the American Ireland Fund. She was a member of the board of the Georgetown University Law Center.         Mrs. Shea is survived by a son, William A. Jr. of Manhattan; two daughters, Kathy Shea Anfuso of Portland, Ore., and Patricia Shea Ryan of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Esther Ralston, a silent-screen actress and vaudeville star who was known for a time as "the American Venus" for her starring role in the 1926 film of that name, died on Jan. 14 at her home in Ventura, Calif. She was 91.         The cause was a heart attack, said Jess L. Hoaglin, a friend.         Miss Ralston, who appeared in more than 150 films before and after the silent era, was born in Bar Harbor, Me., and came to Hollywood in 1916 with her parents. She was soon taking bit parts in Western films. An early appearance with Jackie Coogan in Charlie Chaplin's 1921 film "The Kid" won her the role of Mrs. Darling in a 1924 film adaptation of "Peter Pan." 'American Venus'         In "The American Venus," directed by Frank Tuttle, Ms. Ralston played a star-crossed contestant in the Miss America Pageant who is unable to compete after an automobile accident. Among her other films were "Beggars on Horseback" (1925), "Old Ironsides" (1926), "Children of Divorce" (1927) and "Betrayal" (1929), with Emil Jannings.         In the early 1930's, she made several pictures in Britain, including "Rome Express," opposite Conrad Veidt, and "After the Ball," with Basil Rathbone.         In 1933, she returned to Hollywood, and she acted in films for the rest of the 1930's. One of her last appearances was in "Tin Pan Alley" (1940), which starred Alice Faye. Ms. Ralston came out of retirement in 1961 to play the mother in a daytime soap opera on NBC, "Our Five Daughters." Later, she worked as an actor's agent and as a consultant for a lighting studio in Glens Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Ralston's three marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Ted Lloyd of Phoenix; a brother, Carleton Ralston of Los Angeles; two daughters, Judy Richmond of Mill Valley, Calif., and Mary Baxter of Phoenix; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Phyllis Goodhart Gordan, a benefactor and former trustee of the New York Public Library, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Lucy Rastelli, a daughter.         Mrs. Gordan's association with the library dated to 1940, when her husband, John D. Gordan, joined its staff and became curator of its Berg Collection of English and American literature. After his death in 1968 she was appointed to the committee on research libraries and later was its chairwoman. She was a library trustee from 1974 until 1985.         She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Rastelli of Rome, Marjorie Bowden of London and Virginia Gordan of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, John D. Gordan 3d of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Ruth Pruyn Field, a director of the Field Foundation who was active in civic causes in New York, died on Tuesday at her home in Beaufort, S.C. Mrs. Field, who was 86, also kept a home in Southport, Conn.         The cause was an aneurysm, her family said.         Mrs. Field was the widow of Marshall Field 3d, the publisher and philanthropist, who died in 1956. During their marriage, they both became involved in civic affairs. For many years, her principal interest lay in the Field Family Foundation, which contributed millions to charities promoting child welfare and improved race relations.         A native of Manhattan, Mrs. Field was also a past director of the Citizens Committee for Children in New York City, and the United Nations Association U.S.A. In addition, she was associated with the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation, the Carnegie Hall Corporation, Sarah Lawrence College -- of which she was an honorary trustee -- the Wiltwyck School, the Advisory Committee for the Dalton Schools and the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.         Mrs. Field is survived by a son, Robert L. Phipps of Ridgeland, S.C.; a daughter, Fiona F. Kay, a resident of Alicante province in eastern Spain, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Daisy Newman, a novelist and Quaker historian, died on Tuesday at her home in Lexington, Mass. She was 89.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, J. Nicholas Newman of Wayland, Mass.         Ms. Newman was born in Southport, England, of American parents. She attended Radcliffe College, Barnard College and Oxford University. An active member of the Friends Meeting in Cambridge, Mass., she frequently wrote about Quaker life and history.         She was the author of many novels, including "Now That April's Here," "Diligence in Love," "The Autumn's Brightness" and "I Take Thee, Serenity." She also wrote a history of American Quakers, "A Procession of Friends" (1972).         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Ellen N. Rothchild of Cleveland, and three grandchildren.       
         Anne Joers Firestone, a philanthropist and civic leader in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died at her home there on Dec. 28. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said Bob Troyer, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Firestone was born in New York and graduated from Miss Porter's School. She had lived in Bryn Mawr since the late 1940's and was active in many civic and social organizations. She served with the Red Cross in World War II.         She was the widow of Roger S. Firestone, an industrialist who was the fifth son of Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Roger Firestone died in 1970 at 57.         Mrs. Firestone is survived by a son, John D., of Washington; three daughters, Gay F. Wray and Susan F. Semegen of Paradise Valley, Ariz., and Cinda F. Fox of New York; a brother, Peter Joers of Hot Springs, Ark., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Erica Glaser Wallach, who spent five years in Communist prisons at the height of the cold war on espionage charges that the Soviet authorities later said were false, died on Dec. 22 in Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton, Va. She was 71.         She died of cancer, said Renee Glaser, a cousin.         In 1950, Mrs. Wallach was arrested in what was then East Berlin, where she had gone to seek information about Noel H. and Herta Field, an American couple who had reared Mrs. Wallach and who had been arrested in Prague. The arrests focused worldwide attention on Soviet rule in Eastern Europe.         At the time of her arrest, Mrs. Wallach was married to Robert R. Wallach, a captain in the United States Army, and was living with him and their two children in Paris. Death Sentence Commuted         Mrs. Wallach was held in East Berlin, then in Moscow, where she was tried for espionage, found guilty and given a death sentence that was later commuted to 15 years in prison. In 1954 the Fields were released from prison in Hungary. At the same time, Mr. Field's brother, Hermann, who had been held in Czechoslokavia on espionage charges, was also released.         Mrs. Wallach was released from a Siberian labor camp in 1955 when the Soviet authorities declared that she was innocent of the charges against her. They never explained their change of mind.         Ms. Glaser said Mrs. Wallach had been trapped in a series of intrigues complicated by the fact that she had once worked for the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, and later had briefly been a member of the Communist Party.         "The Soviets thought she was an American spy, while the Western authorities believed she was working for the Communists, and she was caught in the middle of conflicting political forces in postwar Europe," Ms. Glaser said.         After rejoining her family in Warrenton, Mrs. Wallach taught French and Latin at the Highland School for 18 years.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of Burke, Va., and a daughter, Madeleine W. de Heller of Bougy-Villars, Switzerland.       
         Flora Stieglitz Straus, a philanthropist long active in nonprofit organizations benefiting children, died on Jan. 24 at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 98.         In the 1930's and 1940's, Mrs. Strauswas a member and chairman of the New York State Commission for the Blind.         Mrs. Straus was a niece of Alfred Stieglitz. She married Hugh Grant Straus, son of Nathan Straus, merchant and philanthropist, in 1913. She is survived by two daughters, Ann S. Gertler of Montreal and Virginia S. Bersohn of New York; nine grandchildren, and six great-granchildren.         A service is to be held at the Ethical Culture society, 2 West 64th Street, from 3 to 5 P.M. on Sunday, Feb. 20.       
         Edith Weisbuch, a proponent of progressive education and benefactor of Brandeis University, died on Jan. 29 at her home in Kings Point, L.I. She was 89.         The cause was cardiopulmonary complications, said her son Thomas B. Weisbuch.         A graduate of Smith College, Mrs. Weisbuch worked for the creation of a department of child study at Tufts University. In later years she organized a Long Island chapter of the Brandeis Women's Committee, which provided support for the university.         Mrs. Weisbuch is survived by three sons: Paul D. Berman of Manhattan, Jonathan B. Weisbuch of Los Angeles, and Thomas B. Weisbuch of Kings Point; two daughters, Betty W. Stone of Manchester, Mass., and Doris W. Soman of Pittsfield, Mass.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Rose Nussbaum Justin, a lawyer who held legal positions in New York City government, died on Jan. 17 at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 83 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was heart disease, said her daughter, Gail Justin.         After graduating from St. John's University Law School in 1932, Mrs. Justin was the chief counsel for the Bronx Legal Aid Society, an agent for the city's Investigation Division, a Civil Service examiner, a lawyer for the City Rent Commission and a referee in Small Claims Court. She was an administrative law judge for the Parking Violations Bureau for almost 20 years, starting in 1973. At various times she practiced law in Manhattan with her husband, David Justin, who died in 1982.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, Paul, both of Manhattan.       
         Jarmila Novotna, a Czech-born lyric soprano who sang major roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1956, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She died of natural causes, said her daughter, Jarmila Packard.         Miss Novotna was widely considered one of the finest singing actresses of her time. Her interpretations of such roles as Donna Elvira, Euridice, Manon, Melisande, Antonia and Marenka were praised for their intelligence and lyrical grace. She also excelled in trouser roles, particularly Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus," Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier." On hearing her American debut in San Francisco in "Madama Butterfly" in 1939, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: "There is grace, warmth, communicative feeling in all that she does."  'Charming Simplicity'         She made her Metropolitan debut in "La Boheme" in 1940, singing with Jussi Bjoerling. The Times review noted her "charming simplicity, feeling and high artistic intelligence." That year Downes also praised her "great" Violetta at the Met: "She conceived the music, from first note to last, dramatically, and portrayed the character with an aristocratic sensibility and simplicity.         "The word and the tone were indissoluble; the phrasing was that of the finest musician."         In her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Miss Novotna sang 193 performances -- 142 in the opera house, the rest on tour -- and won consistent praise for her expressiveness and musicianship.         Her acting abilities and regal appearance also led to other offers: the director Max Reinhardt urged her to devote herself to the theater; the studio head Louis B. Mayer asked her to become a film star. During the course of her career, she appeared in Hollywood films ("The Great Caruso," "The Search"), on Broadway (as an unscrupulous concert singer in the 1953 drama "Sherlock Holmes") and on television (as Kim Stanley's mother in a postwar drama set in France). But she resisted all attempts to steer her away from singing, which was her first love.  Art as Beauty         "Of course there are many important things in life besides music," she said in a 1989 interview in Opera News, "but that doesn't make music unimportant. If you love music, what would life be without it -- can you imagine? Art is what brings beauty into life."         Miss Novotna studied with Emmy Destinn and made her debut at the age of 17 with the Prague National Opera. She continued her studies in Milan and became a member of the Vienna State Opera from 1933 to 1938, eventually singing opera and concerts in most of the major houses of Europe. The Met invited her to sing in 1928, but she did not want to be separated from her future husband, the Baron George Daubek, whom she married in 1931.         Toscanini brought her to the attention of the Met again after she sang Pamina under his direction in Salzburg in 1937. She came to New York in 1940, arriving, she noted years later, the day Hitler marched into Prague.  A Recording Re-released         During the war years she recorded "Songs of Lidice," in memory of the victims of the Nazi massacre. The recording, recently rereleased on CD by Supraphon, presents folk songs of her native land; the piano accompaniments are by Jan Masaryk, the son of the former president of Czechoslovakia.         Masaryk died in 1948, and the loss of his protection led to the nationalization of the Daubeks' 3,700-acre estate and castle. That same year, Miss Novotna appeared in Fred Zinnemann's film "The Search," as a mother seeking her lost son at the end of World War II.         Miss Novotna moved from Vienna to New York after her husband's death in 1981. She was frequently seen at opera performances and at events celebrating the art of singing.         In addition to her daughter, of New York City, she is survived by a son, George Daubek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Madelin Thayer Gilpatric, a volunteer for almost five decades for several nonprofit organizations in New York City and California, died last Thursday at New York Hospital. She was in her 80's.         The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, according to her family.         Mrs. Gilpatric was a founder and past vice president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of New York City. She also served on the board of the California Institute of Arts in Valencia for 36 years and of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City for 17 years.         In addition, she worked with the Lighthouse for the Blind, the American Cancer Society, the Institute for Religion and Psychology and the International Press Institute.         Mrs. Gilpatric, a graduate of Syracuse University, was the widow of Arthur Kudner, whose advertising agency bore his name. Her marriage to Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy Administration, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two brothers, Albert Thayer of Baldwin, L.I., and John Thayer of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Arthur Kudner of Grasonville, Md.; a daughter, Karyl McKay of Alanson, Mich., and six grandchildren.       
         Andrea Heinemann Simon, a community leader in Riverdale, the Bronx, died yesterday at her home there. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Joanna Walker.         Mrs. Simon served for more than 30 years on the board of directors of the Riverdale Mental Health Association. She also worked for the association as a fund-raiser. In addition, she was a director of the Riverdale Chapter of the United Nations Association.         Her husband, Richard L. Simon, was a co-founder of Simon & Schuster, the publishers. He died in 1960.         Mrs. Simon is survived by three daughters, Carly Simon, the singer and composer, Lucy Levine and Joanna Walker, all of Manhattan, and a son, Peter Simon of Chilmark, Mass.       
         Maria St. Just, an actress and longtime friend of Tennessee Williams, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was in her late 60's or early 70's, her family said.         The cause was heart failure brought on by severe rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter Natasha Grenfell.         Lady St. Just was born in Petrograd but was taken by her mother to London when she was an infant. Her father, a doctor, remained in the Soviet Union and was later executed. She studied ballet as a young girl, but a leg operation when she was 14 put an end to her plans for a dancing career.         She won a scholarship to study at the Old Vic, after which she joined John Gielgud's company.         In 1948, before the company embarked on a foreign tour, she attended a party given by Mr. Gielgud in honor of Williams. A lifelong friendship with the playwright ensued. Lady St. Just was a co-executor of Williams's estate, and in 1990 she published "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982" (Alfred A. Knopf).         She appeared in the film "Room With a View" (1985) and in "Maurice" (1987), which was filmed at her estate near Salisbury.         In 1956 she married Peter Grenfell, the son of a British partner of J. P. Morgan. In 1973 Grenfell became a peer. He died in 1984.         In addition to her daughter Natasha, of London, she is survived by another daughter, Pulcheria, of Orleans, France, and two granddaughters.       
         Susanne M. Yardney, a Russian emigre and a patron of the arts died on Friday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was heart disease, said Dr. Jon Yardney, her son.         Mrs. Yardney came to the United States in 1940, settled in New York and was a founding member of Friends of Carnegie Hall. She and her late husband, Michel Yardney, also endowed a scholarship fund for young pianists through the America-Israel Cultural Foundation.         She is survived by a daughter, Maya Ryan of Manhattan; her son, of Wayne, Pa., and five granddaughters.       
         Margaret Lane, the Dowager Countess of Huntingdon, a British author whose works included books about Peter Rabbit's creator, Beatrix Potter, died last Monday in Southampton, England. She was 86 and lived outside Southampton.         Miss Lane's two biographies of Miss Potter were the basis of "The Tale of Beatrix Potter," a two-part BBC dramatization shown on "Masterpiece Theater" on WNET in 1984 that was praised as a simple yet intense story with just the right touches of unflinching reserve.         Miss Lane's two books, "The Tale of Beatrix Potter: a Biography" (1946, Warne and Viking Penguin) and "The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter" (1978), were praised last week in the London newspaper The Independent as enriched by Miss Lane's own "exquisite sympathy with animals."         When "The Tale of Beatrix Potter" was published in the United States, it was lauded for its deep understanding of Miss Potter, who helped Miss Lane with the book, and for its vivid depiction of Miss Potter walking the hills and moors, gathering material for stories and pictures.         Miss Lane's 1975 book "Samuel Johnson and his World" has been called one of the very best modern works on Johnson. Her 1953 book about the writer Charlotte Bronte and members of her family, "The Bronte Story," won praise as an outstanding literary biography. And her 1965 novel "A Night at Sea" was lauded for its poignancy and narrative suspense.         Her other books -- she wrote more than two dozen, all told -- included "A Calabash of Diamonds" (1961), a personal account of an African safari; "Purely for Pleasure" (1967), a collection of essays, and "The Day of the Feast" (1968), a novel. She also wrote children's books.         The daughter of a journalist, Miss Lane studied at St. Hugh's College of Oxford University, worked as a reporter for some years and went on to become a critic as well as an author.         Her 1934 marriage to Bryan Wallace, son of the writer Edgar Wallace, was dissolved in 1939. In 1944 she was married to the 15th Earl of Huntingdon, a mural painter, and he died in 1990. They had two daughters.       
         Dinah Shore, a vivacious entertainer who was widely loved for her homey, heartfelt singing and breezy Southern charm, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Constance L. Stone, her publicity agent.         Miss Shore's career, which spanned more than 50 years, embraced radio, pop records and television, and reached its zenith in the 1950's and 60's when she appeared four times in a Gallup Poll of the most admired women in the world. Among her many honors were 10 Emmy Awards.         It was on "The Dinah Shore Chevy Show," a weekly television variety program that ran from 1956 to 1963, that she sang the jingle that would become her unofficial theme, "See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet." From 1970 to 1984, she was the host of several television talk programs, in which her vitality and relaxed rapport with celebrities from all walks of life established her as a forerunner of stars like Oprah Winfrey. A Friend of the Camera         "I don't know how to be afraid of that old red eye," she once said, referring to the television camera. "It's one person to me. I don't visualize large numbers of people out there. I'm comfortable with it."         Miss Shore, whose original name was Frances Rose Shore, was born on March 1, 1917, in Winchester, Tenn. She graduated from Vanderbilt University, where she majored in sociology. While in college, she made her radio debut with a 15-minute program on the Nashville station WSM. The theme song of that program was the 1925 hit song "Dinah," a name she adopted legally in 1944.         In 1938, Miss Shore came to New York, where she took a singing job with the radio station WNEW. The next year, she secured a two-week engagement singing with Leo Reisman's popular orchestra at the Strand Theater. In 1940, she began to build a national following as a performer on the NBC program "Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street" and on Eddie Cantor's program, where she was a regular guest for three years before starting her own program.         In 1940, she signed a recording contract with RCA Victor and had her first hits, "The Breeze and I" (with Xavier Cugat's orchestra) and "Yes, My Darling Daughter." These were the earliest of some 75 hit records she recorded between 1940 and 1955. Her 1942 recording of "Blues in the Night" sold a million copies and established her as a sultry blues-tinged balladeer in the tradition of Ethel Waters and Mildred Bailey. 'I'll Walk Alone'         She had her first No. 1 hit in 1944 with "I'll Walk Alone," a quintessential World War II song of longing. Among her other major hits were "The Gypsy" (1946), "The Anniversary Song" (1947), "Buttons and Bows" (1948) and "Dear Hearts and Gentle People" (1949).         "Buttons and Bows" became the most popular in a long line of novelty hits she recorded, trading on her down-home image and Southern drawl. Other such songs were "Shoofly Pie and Apple Pandowdy" and "Pass the Jam, Sam."         The success of "Blues in the Night" led to roles in several movies, including "Up In Arms" (1944) and "Till the Clouds Roll By" (1946). But her movie career was short-lived (she appeared in only seven pictures), and she quickly returned to radio and a new recording contract with Columbia. In an interview in 1981, Miss Shore said she felt she had "bombed" as a movie star. "I'm just not photogenic," she said.         But the charm and vitality that somehow eluded the movie cameras made her one of television's biggest stars for three decades. Much more than her singing, it was her personality -- direct, unpretentious and enthusiastic -- that made her into a symbolic Everywoman of the 1950's and 60's. 1951 Start on TV         She started on television in 1951 with "The Dinah Shore Show," a 15-minute musical program. Then, with the more elaborate "Dinah Shore Chevy Show" in 1956, she became one of the few female entertainers to have long-term success as the host of a television variety program.         In the 1970's, Miss Shore switched from musical variety to talk programs with "Dinah" (1970-74), "Dinah's Place" (1974-79) and "Dinah and Friends" (1979-84). More recently, a weekly cable-television show, "A Conversation With Dinah,' ran from 1989 to 1991 on the Nashville Network, for which she also was the host of specials with Eddy Arnold and Burt Reynolds.         Miss Shore was married twice. Her 1943 marriage to the movie star George Montgomery ended in divorce in 1962. A second marriage, in 1963, to Maurice F. Smith, a professional tennis player, lasted less than a year. During the 1970's, Miss Shore had a six-year relationship with Mr. Reynolds that was highly publicized because she was nearly 20 years older than he.         Miss Shore, a sports enthusiast, played tennis and golf and sponsored a professional golf tournament, the Dinah Shore Classic, in the Palm Springs, Calif., area for more than two decades. She was also the author of three cookbooks, including the best-selling "Someone's in the Kitchen With Dinah."         She is survived by a daughter, Melissa Ann Hime; a son, John David Montgomery, and three grandchildren.       
         Isabel Bassett Wasson, one of the country's first female petroleum geologists, died on Monday in La Grange Park, Ill. She was 97.         A former resident of River Forest, Ill., Mrs. Wasson moved to the Plymouth Place Retirement Community in La Grange Park 10 years ago.         Mrs. Wasson, a native of Brooklyn, was a Phi Beta Kappa history graduate of Wellesley College. She then studied geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the University of Chicago, and in 1920 earned a master's degree in the subject, specializing in petroleum geology, at Columbia University.         One of the country's few female geologists at the time, Mrs. Wasson took part in explorations in remote areas of South America in the 1920's. In 1928, she embarked on a career of more than 50 years of teaching, lecturing and public service from her base in River Forest.         Mrs. Wasson is survived by two daughters, Elizabeth W. Bergstrom of South Harpswell, Me., and Anne Harney Gallagher of Boston; a son, Edward B., of Denver; a sister, Helen Hauser Jordan of Short Hills., N.J.; 13 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Roosevelt McMillan, a photographer who was the eldest grandchild of President Theodore Roosevelt, died on Tuesday at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. She was 82 and lived in Baltimore.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Born Grace Green Roosevelt in San Francisco, she graduated from the Sorbonne in Paris and became an accomplished freelance photographer. She was a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. During World War II she managed the large McMillan family farm in Maryland while her husband served in the Navy in the Pacific.         She was the only daughter of Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., a soldier, author and publisher, who died in the cross-Channel assault on Omaha Beach in 1944. A highly decorated officer and former Governor of Puerto Rico, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.         Mrs. McMillan is survived by her husband of 60 years, William, a retired architect; a daughter, Eleanor McMillan of Bethesda, Md.; a son, William Jr., of Baltimore; a brother, Theodore Roosevelt 3d of Mount Desert, Me., and three granddaughters.       
         Betty Heitman, a Republican Party official who prodded two Presidents to appoint more women to high Government posts, died on Monday at her home in Baton Rouge, La. She was 64.         Her son, Paul, attributed her death to natural causes.         Mrs. Heitman was co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee during the Reagan years. A conservative Republican, she was Ronald Reagan's choice for the committee post in 1980, when he ran for President. She had previously been president of the National Federation of Republican Women. She was re-elected by the national committee three times, serving until 1987.         Mrs. Heitman then directed President George Bush's Committee on Executive Exchange, which promoted close relations between the Government and private business through an exchange of executives. She retired from national politics three years ago and returned to Baton Rouge.         While in Washington, she established her own consulting firm, the Heitman Group, which lobbied for international marketing interests, among others.         She was born in Malvern, Ark. A graduate of Texas Women's University, she became active in Louisiana Republican politics and was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1968 and 1976.         Mrs. Heitman was married to Dr. Henry S. Heitman, who died in 1992. Besides her son Paul, a resident of Baton Rouge, she is survived by a daughter, Donna Jones, also of Baton Rouge; two other sons, Thomas, of Springfield, Va., and Perry, of Baton Rouge, and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Madeline C. Hunter, an educator and psychologist who translated a psychological learning theory into practical teaching techniques, died last Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78 and lived in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles.         Dr. Hunter had a series of strokes, said the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she was an adjunct professor.         Dr. Hunter was nationally known for her work at the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School, the laboratory school of U.C.L.A.'s Graduate School of Education. She served as its principal from 1963 until 1982, when she became a full-time professor in administration and teacher education at the graduate school.         She used her background in psychology to tailor different approaches for helping pupils learn. Her technique identified the most effective methods for teachers in helping pupils overcome any barriers to learning. Her research challenged the view that failure to learn stems from environmental factors like poverty, broken homes or a low I.Q. She believed that proper teaching methods could overcome any disadvantage.         "We have yet to find a student who won't learn," she once said.         She showed the effectiveness of teacher-parent partnerships in education and the importance of helping pupils maintain their self-respect.         A native of Saskatchewan, she grew up in Santa Monica, Calif., and earned four degrees in psychology and education at U.C.L.A. She began a career as a clinical psychologist and then became a school principal. She led schools in different sections of Los Angeles, including Watts and Bel Air, before becoming principal at university elementary.         She wrote 12 books and more than 300 articles on teaching.         Dr. Hunter is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Cheryl,, of Los Angeles; a son, Robin, of Santa Monica; a sister, Dorothy Horner, of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.       
         Willie Mae Ford Smith, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Wednesday at the Tower Village Nursing Home in St. Louis. She was 89.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and her recording producer.         Mother Smith, as she was widely known, was one of the first singers to perform in the blues-influenced gospel style created by Thomas A. Dorsey in the 1920's and 30's. Her deep contralto and flamboyant vocal flights made her a leading performer of the 1930's and 40's, and she was a major influence on singers like Mahalia Jackson.         Willie Mae Ford was born in Rolling Fork, Miss., 1 of 14 children in a musical family. She moved to St. Louis at the age of 12, and sang with family members in the Ford Sisters. In 1927, she married James Peter Smith and began a career as a soloist.         She started working with Dorsey's National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in the early 1930's, and she became the director of the convention's Soloist's Bureau, evaluating and training gospel singers until the late 1980's. During the 1930's and 40's, she constantly toured the Midwest with her adopted daughter, Bertha, as accompanist. But while her style and showmanship were widely imitated, she did not make her first recording until 1950. She later recorded albums for the Nashboro, Savoy and Spirit Feel labels.         In 1972 she began to receive national recognition after an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. She appeared in the 1981 gospel documentary film "Say Amen, Somebody," and received a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. She continued to perform regularly at the Lively Stone Apostolic Church in St. Louis until the early 1990's.         She is survived by her sisters Emma, Geneva and Georgie; a daughter, Jacqueline; a son, William; four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, all of St. Louis.       
         Doris C. Frankel, a playwright whose work found its way to Broadway, radio and television and who won an Emmy Award for her work on the soap opera "All My Children," died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was a stroke, said her son Benjamin R. Barber.         Ms. Frankel was the author of "Love Me Long," which starred Shirley Booth and Anne Jackson on Broadway in 1949. She also wrote "Don't Throw Glass Houses," which was produced on Broadway in 1938.         Ms. Frankel was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Radcliffe College in 1931. Her husband, Phillip Barber, was the New York director of the Federal Theater, and Ms. Frankel was one of those involved in founding the Group Theater in the 1930's. At that time she also taught at the Yale Drama School.         Ms. Frankel also helped create the radio characters Ma Perkins and Helen Trent. Her television work during the 1950's included dramas for "Playhouse 90" and "Hallmark Hall of Fame."         In later years she was a head writer for daytime television dramas and wrote scripts for "General Hospital" and "Search for Tomorrow" in addition to "All My Children," for which she received an Emmy in the 1970's.         In addition to her son Benjamin, of Piscataway, N.J., she is survived by another son, Willson Barber of Becket, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Anita Morris, an actress who was nominated for a 1982 Tony Award for her exuberant performance as a brassy redhead in black-lace body stocking in the musical "Nine," died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, the director Grover Dale.         Ms. Morris was acting in George Lucas's next film, "Radioland Murders," in Wilmington, N.C., in December when the cancer was discovered, Mr. Dale said. She was forced to leave the production, and started treatment at that time.         Her musical number in "Nine," "Call From the Vatican," choreographed by Tommy Tune, caused a brief controversy when CBS censors decided it was too risque and banished it from the 1982 Tony Awards program. Ms. Morris was nominated that year for best featured actress in a musical, and also won a Drama Desk award for her performance. Sexy Telephone Call         In the number, Carla (Ms. Morris), a mistress of the director Guido (Raul Julia), got through to her lover when he was on a movie set by pretending that her telephone call was from the Vatican. Dancing on a pedestal, she proceeded to woo him by telephone. Frank Rich, writing in The New York Times, called the number "a dazzling choreographic gem," adding that Ms. Morris "superbly executes a one-body simulation of two-body copulation."         Ms. Morris, who was born in Durham, N.C., studied at the National Academy of Dramatic Arts and began her performing career in the American Mime Theater.         An appearance in the chorus of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 1972 led to roles on Broadway in "Seesaw" (1973) and "The Magic Show" (1974), in which she was directed by her husband. Ms. Morris subsequently took over several leading roles on Broadway, including those in "Sugar Babies" in 1980 and "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" in 1981.         On film, Ms. Morris played the mistress of Danny DeVito's character in "Ruthless People," and had roles in "The Hotel New Hampshire," "Maria's Lovers," "Absolute Beginners," "18 Again," "Blue City," "Me and the Kid" and "A Sinful Life."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Dr. J. B. and Eloise Morris, and two brothers, Byron and Douglas, all of Durham, and a son, James.       
         Dorette Kruse Fleischmann, a civic leader and socialite in New York and Cincinnati, died yesterday at the Racquet Club in Chicago. She was 88.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Joan Tobin.         She and her husband, Julius Fleischmann, whose family made its fortune through yeast, were benefactors of many cultural and civic groups, including the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Opera and the Council on Foreign Affairs.         Mrs. Fleischmann graduated from Smith College in 1927.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Charles Fleischmann 3d of Cincinnati; another daughter, Dorette Fleischmann of The Plains, Va.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick.         Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.         Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.         Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins. Youth in Hollywood and London         Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."         After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.         Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.         She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.       
         Rebecca Pollard Van Lennep Guggenheim Logan, a philanthropist and patron of the arts who was for a generation one of the best-known social hostesses in Washington, died on Friday at her home in Washington. She was 90.         The cause was heart failure, said Leonard L. Silverstein, her lawyer.         For 21 years she was married to Col. M. Robert Guggenheim, an heir to a copper fortune, who died in 1959. Their 55-room residence, Firenze House, is one of Washington's great estates, set on 22 acres in the northwestern section of the city.         From the 1940's to the 1970's Firenze House was the setting for social functions attended by Presidents, Government officials, diplomats and business executives. It was also used for charity fund-raising events.         Mrs. Logan was active in committees aiding the National Society of Arts and Letters, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the National Symphony and the Opera Society of Washington.         She studied art in New York and graduated from the school at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. While there, she met and in 1926 married a Harvard student, Dr. William B. Van Lennep Jr. They divorced in 1937.         The next year she married Colonel Guggenheim , who was United States Ambassador to Portugal in 1953 and 1954, aboard his 175-foot yacht.         After Colonel Guggenheim died, she married John A. Logan in 1962. Mr. Logan, a management consultant in Washington, died in 1986.         She is survived by a son, Richard Van Lennep of Washington; a nephew, Randolph M. Pollard of Las Vegas, Nev., and a niece, Beverly Page of Bow, N.H.       
         Aurelia Schober Plath, an educator and the editor of the correspondence of her daughter, the poet Sylvia Plath, died on Friday at the North Hill Health Center in Needham, Mass. She was 87, and lived in North Hill, Mass.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said her son, Warren J. Plath of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.         Ms. Plath was born in Boston and grew up in Winthrop, Mass. In 1942 she became an instructor at Boston University's College of Practical Arts and Letters, where she developed a program for training medical secretaries. She became an associate professor before retiring in 1971.         After teaching for two years at Cape Cod Community College in Hyannis, Mass., she devoted herself to editing the personal correspondence of her daughter, who committed suicide in 1963. "Letters Home: Correspondence 1950-1963, by Sylvia Plath" was published in 1975 and formed the basis for the play of the same name by Rose Leiman Goldemberg.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a brother, Frank Schober of West Chester, Pa., three granddaughters and a grandson.       
         Francine Strickler-Greenspan, a former president of the Saxon Textile Corporation in Manhattan's TriBeCa area, died yesterday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was a brain tumor, her family said.         A graduate of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Strickler-Greenspan spent over 25 years with Saxon Textile, a firm founded by her parents, and became one of the first women to reach a top-level position in her industry. The company dyes and finishes twills, poplins and nylons for manufacturers. She served as its president from 1980 until her illness.         She is survived by her husband, Julian Greenspan; two daughters, Gail W. Strickler and Debbye Strickler, both of Manhattan, and a son, Dr. Howard Strickler of Washington.

         Mai Zetterling, the Swedish actress who went on to a career as one of Europe's busiest female film directors, died on Tuesday in London. She was 68 and had homes in London and in Banne, France.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, Joyce Edwards.         Ms. Zetterling was directing the film "The Woman Who Cleaned the World," which she had written, when she died.         Mai Elisabeth Zetterling was born in Vasteras, Sweden, to a working-class family. She left school barely literate, according to her 1985 autobiography, "All Those Tomorrows."         After working in a drug store and a mail-order company, she tried acting and was invited to join the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her stage and screen debuts when she was 17. Breakthrough in 'Torment'         Her sensitive portrayal of a simple girl victimized by a sadistic professor in "Torment" (released in the United States in 1947), created a sensation and is now considered a landmark of the Swedish cinema. The film, directed by Alf Sjoberg and written by Ingmar Bergman, was released under the title "Frenzy" in England and made her an international star.         She also appeared in "Frieda" (1947), "Desperate Moment" (1953), "Knock on Wood" with Danny Kaye (1954), "A Prize of Gold" with Richard Widmark (1955), "Abandon Ship!" with Tyrone Power (1957), "Only Two Can Play" with Peter Sellers (1961), "The Vine Bridge" (1965), "The Witches" (1990) and "Hidden Agenda" (1990).         In the 1960's and 1970's she was one of the few women who found regular work as a director. Her first effort, "The War Game" (1963), a short documentary, won a first prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Many of her subsequent films dealt explicitly with female sexuality and focused on the role of women in society.         Among her directorial credits are "Loving Couples" (1964), "Night Games" (1966), "Doctor Glas" (1968), "The Girls" (1969), "Vincent the Dutchman" (1975), "Lady Policeman" (1979), "Of Seals and Men" (1979) "Scrubbers" (1983) and "Amorosa" (1986).         In later years she continued acting, co-starring with Anjelica Huston in Nicholas Roeg's 1990 film "The Witches."         Ms. Zetterling also wrote children's books, short stories and novels, one of which, "Night Games," she adapted and directed for the screen.         Her two marriages, to Tutte Lemkow, a Norwegian dancer, and the novelist David Hughes, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son and a daughter from her first marriage.       
         Sayra Fischer Lebenthal, a Wall Street legend who was a co-founder in 1925 of the investment-banking firm of Lebenthal & Company and remained active in it for 67 years, died on Thursday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lebenthal was a newlywed when she and her husband, Louis S. Lebenthal, set up shop in a tiny office with second-hand furniture and no rugs. They sought their niche as bond traders and found it.         Bonds had been around since Colonial times, when they were used to finance militias, but in 1925 they were still considered an investment for millionaires. The new firm spotted an opening that had been missed by others: they looked for odd lots of small-denomination bonds from estates and other neglected sources and offered them to relatively modest savers.         The company thrived, continuing to do so after the death of Louis Lebenthal in 1951. Mrs. Lebenthal, grieving, decided to stay in business. She specialized in tax-exempt municipal bonds for small investors, and watched the market for them soar.         For years, she put in full workweeks checking the day's municipal offerings and dealing with clients by telephone until, at 92, a fall put her in failing health. She had already begun to delegate management control in thge 1980's and disposed of her majority holding in the firm about four years ago.         A native of Keyport, N.J., she graduated from Syracuse University Law School and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1923. Set to practice law, she married Mr. Lebenthal in 1925 and he persuaded her to go into a partnership as bond traders.         Mrs. Lebenthal was remarried in 1956 to I. Arnold Ross, a lawyer and former State Assemblyman. He died in 1981. She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Lebenthal Bissinger of Manhattan; a son, Jim Lebenthal, the firm's chairman and spokesman, also of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Nancy K. Robinson, an author of children's books and narrations for documentary films, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 51.         The cause was cancer, said her father, Norris Konheim.         During her career Mrs. Robinson wrote more than 20 books for children between the ages of 7 and 12. She also wrote stories for children published by Scholastic Inc. She was a 1964 graduate of Vassar College.         She is survived by a son, Kenneth, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Alice Robinson of Manhattan; her parents, Norris and Natalie Konheim of Longboat Key, Fla., and a sister, Patty Goldenberg of Waban, Mass.       
         Lili Damita, a French-born actress who became one of Hollywood's most glamorous celebrities in the early years of talking pictures, died on Monday in Good Samaritan Medical Center in Palm Beach, Fla. She was thought to be about 90, and she lived in Palm Beach.         She had Alzheimer's disease, The Associated Press reported.         Miss Damita was born in Paris. She spoke five languages and was filming in Berlin when Samuel Goldwyn brought her to Hollywood in 1928 to star with Ronald Colman in Joseph Conrad's "Rescue." A review in The New York Times noted that Miss Damita "is fascinatingly handsome and gives an intelligent performance" in a difficult role. Marriage and a Retirement         Over the next seven years she was seen in more than a dozen films, and the press chronicled her comings and goings, her rumored or real love affairs and every change of hairdo. Her career ended abruptly when she married Errol Flynn, a dashing newcomer to Hollywood, in 1935. She retired from acting and stayed retired after the marriage ended in 1942.         After "The Rescue" she starred in Thornton Wilder's "Bridge of San Luis Rey" (1929). She played opposite Victor McLaglen in "The Cock Eyed World" (1929); Gary Cooper in "Fighting Caravans" (1931); Adolphe Menjou, Laurence Olivier and Erich von Stroheim in "Friends and Lovers" (1931), and Jack Buchanan in "Brewster's Millions" (1935).         Her last film paired her with James Cagney in the "Frisco Kid." She also appeared on Broadway, making her stage debut in "Sons o' Guns" in 1930 with Goldwyn's permission. She starred with Bert Lahr and Eleanor Powell in "George White's Music Hall Varieties," a 1932 vaudeville show. Dancing and Singing         Miss Damita, whose name was originally Liliane Carre, spent much of her childhood at convents in Portugal, Spain and Greece, and she studied dancing in Belgium. As a teen-ager, she danced and sang for the troops in World War I. She then danced with the Paris Opera and, at 19, succeeded Mistinguette as star of the Casino de Paris Revue.         Miss Damita -- the name means little lady in Spanish -- had a son with Mr. Flynn, Sean, who was a photojournalist and who disappeared in Cambodia in 1970. Her second marriage in 1962 to Allen B. Loomis, an Iowa manufacturer, also ended in divorce.       
         Sarah Patton Boyle, an author who was active in civil rights matters, died on Feb. 20 at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 87.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said her son Roger.         Mrs. Boyle described her experiences as a white Southern woman coming to understand the problems of many black Americans in her book "The Desegregated Heart" (1962). Her other books on human relations were "For Human Beings Only" (1964) and "The Back Together Heart" (1966). Her last book, "The Desert Blooms" (1985), described her personal experiences with aging.         In addition to her son Roger, of Cos Cob, Conn., she is survived by another son, the Rev. Patton L. Boyle of Corvallis, Ore.       
         Claire Nichtern, who produced or helped to produce several dozen Broadway plays and musicals in her theatrical career, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Nichtern.         From 1979 to 1985 Ms. Nichtern was president of Warner Theater Productions, a division of Warner Communications. During that period she produced over 30 plays and musicals for Warner, among them "Crimes of the Heart" by Beth Henley, which won a Pulitzer Prize.         In 1955 Ms. Nichtern took an aptitude test that suggested that theater production would be a good field for her talents. She accepted a job as a receptionist at the Phoenix Theater in Greenwich Village and rose quickly to casting director.         In the early 1960's she helped in the production of two short plays, "The Typist" and "The Tiger" by Murray Schisgal, starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, at the Theater de Lys. The production was an immediate success.         In 1965 Ms. Nichtern won the Tony Award as best producer of a drama for her Broadway production of Mr. Schisgal's comedy "Luv," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Mr. Wallach, Ms. Jackson and Alan Arkin. Among her other productions of the 1960's and 1970's were "The Banker's Daughter," "Jimmy Shine," "Cold Storage," "House of Blue Leaves," "Absent Friends" and "I Got a Song."         Ms. Nichtern's two marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, David, both of Manhattan.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Dr. Kathryn Frederick Clarenbach, a founding member and the first chairwoman of the National Organization for Women, died on Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 73.         The cause was complications from emphysema, her family said.         Dr. Clarenbach, known as Kay, was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, where she earned her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in that subject. She taught in Indiana, New York and Michigan before returning to Madison to teach at the University of Wisconsin and Edgewood College. She retired in 1988.         A native of Sparta, Wis., she worked for many years on the university's program of continuing education for women. For 13 years, she headed Wisconsin's Commission on the Status of Women, helping to shape changes in the laws on sexual assault, divorce and marital property.         On the national level, she was an organizer of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1966, she was a founder of NOW and led it with Betty Friedan, the organization's first president, until 1970.         Dr. Clarenbach is survived by two daughters, Sara Clarenbach of Madison, and Janet Mallon of Oswego, N.Y.; a son, David, of Madison, and one grandson.       
         Deane W. Lord, a public relations official at Harvard University for 35 years, died on Tuesday at Youville Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. Mrs. Lord, who lived in Cambridge, was 67.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokesman.         Mrs. Lord began her career at Harvard as a public relations officer at Radcliffe College in 1958 and became director of that school's news office two years later. In 1973 she became director of the Harvard News Office, and was named director of information in 1981.         She was a 1948 graduate of Bennington College and received a master's degree in dramatic arts from Smith College.         Mrs. Lord is survived by her husband, Edwin Jr., of Cambridge; a son, Edwin 3d, of Frankfurt, Germany; a daughter, Mary, of Washington, and a brother, Ted Allen of Scottsdale, Ariz.       
         Shirley Ann Dungan Kheel, a lawyer and civic worker, died yesterday at her Manhattan home. She was 49.         Mrs. Kheel died of cancer, said her husband, Robert.         Her son David was the first child to be born in New York after conception by laboratory methods.         Mrs. Kheel was active in the Trinity and Collegiate schools in Manhattan, the Urban League and the Howard and Georgeanna Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine. She was a graduate of the University of Rochester and received a law degree from Yeshiva University.         She is survived by her husband and sons, Daniel and David, all of Manhattan; her father, James O. Dungan of Rochester; two sisters, Laura Dungan of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Dr. Bonnie Dungan of Philadelphia, and two brothers, James Dungan of Binghamton, N.Y., and Kelly Dungan of Rochester. Her father-in-law is Theodore Kheel, the labor mediator and lawyer, of Manhattan.       
         Luba Potamkin, a broadcasting spokeswoman in the 1970's for her family's Cadillac auto dealerships on the East Coast, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 73.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Victor Potamkin.         Three years after her husband founded Potamkin Cadillac in 1972, Mrs. Potamkin and other members of her family appeared in television commercials that featured the line: "If this nameplate isn't on the back of your car, you probably paid too much."         The ebullient commercials, which were also broadcast by Potamkin dealerships on television stations in Pennsylvania and Florida, were noticed. Mr. Potamkin said his forceful merchandising in New York helped his sales.         Mrs. Potamkin, the former Luba Chalken, was born in Philadelphia. She was married to Victor for 52 years and for a large part of that time was content to be a wife and mother to her two sons.  Fighting Against Alzheimer's         She said of her career as a Cadillac spokeswoman on television, which she amplified to include health and fashion tips, that she never studied a script in advance. She told an interviewer in 1977, "To me, it's easy because it's my business and I'm thrilled to say, 'Buy a Cadillac.' "         Her son Alan recalled yesterday that the ad campaign was hatched by his father, who convinced his wife, who was at first reluctant, to do it.         The Potamkin family relinquished the dealership in 1987, selling the assets and leasing the company's Manhattan real estate to General Motors.  For several years the dealership fell into decline under new operators with a more muted television campaign.         Two years ago the Potamkin family resumed operations under the name Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet.         Mrs. Potamkin then became a symbol of the fight against Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed as having in the late 1970's. She and her husband made major donations to research into the disease, and in 1987 the Potamkin family created the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer Research, an annual award of $100,000. They were also active in sponsoring fund-raising events for medical research.         In addition to her husband, who maintains homes in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, she is survived by two sons, Robert, of Philadelphia and Alan, of Miami; a sister, Florence Jans of Miami; a brother, Marvin Chaiken of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
         Sonia Raiziss, a New York literary figure for many years, died on March 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said Alfredo de Palchi, her collaborator and former husband.         A poet, translator and critic, Ms. Raiziss was an editor of Chelsea, a semi-annual avant-garde literary magazine featuring poems and prose by promising new writers. She became an editor of the magazine in 1960, two years after its founding.         Chelsea published early work by such authors as Sylvia Plath, Umberto Eco, Raymond Carver and Grace Paley. Many of its back numbers are collectors' items. Published as High School Student         A native of Germany, Ms. Raiziss was brought to this country as a child and grew up in Philadelphia. Her earliest poems were published while she was in high school, and her subsequent work appeared widely in literary magazines.         She earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of Philadelphia, where her father, the biochemist Dr. George W. Raiziss, was a professor. She also studied at Columbia University and published her first collection of poems, "Through a Glass Darkly," as a student at the Sorbonne.         Her first book of criticism, "Metaphysical Passion: Seven Modern American Poets and the 17th-Century Tradition," was published in 1952 by the University of Philadelphia and reissued by Greenwood Press in 1970. "Bucks County Blues," a volume of her poetry that appeared in 1977, also remains in print.         Most recently, she was the translator of "The Scorpion's Dark Dance" (1993), a volume of Italian poetry by Mr. de Palchi.         She is survived by a son, Peter St. Mu Raiziss of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Evan Burger Donaldson, president of the board of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children in New York, a nonprofit adoption service, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. Mrs. Donaldson, who lived in Manhattan, was 60.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said her husband, William H. Donaldson.         Mrs. Donaldson was also involved with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the New York Women's Association and the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy. She graduated from Vassar College.         She is survived by her husband, who is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, a daughter, Kimberly Donaldson-Plym, and a son, Matthew, all of New York.       
         Jean Brown, a collector of Dada, Surrealism and Fluxus, died on Sunday at the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 82 and lived in Tyringham, Mass.         She died of natural causes, said her son, Jonathan, of Princeton, N.J.         Sometimes called the den mother of Fluxus, Mrs. Brown possessed a natural openness to new art and counted among her friends such avant-gardists as Marcel Duchamp, John Cage and George Maciunas, the leader of the Fluxus movement.  Going to Museums         Mrs. Brown, whose maiden name was Levy, was born in 1911 in Brooklyn. Her father was a rare-book dealer who enjoyed taking his daughter to museums. She briefly attended Columbia University. In 1936, she married Leonard Brown, an insurance agent. They settled in Springfield, Mass., where Mrs. Brown worked as a librarian.         In the late 1950's, after collecting Abstract Expressionist paintings, the Browns began to acquire Dadaist and Surrealist art, manifestoes and periodicals. They soon moved on to Fluxus, a new, irreverent art movement that stressed multiples, printed ephemera, posters, newspapers and mail art.         After Mr. Brown's death in 1971, Mrs. Brown moved to Tyringham, and expanded into areas adjacent to Fluxus, including artists' books, concrete poetry, happenings and performance art. Her home, originally a Shaker seed house, became an important center for both Fluxus artists and scholars, with Mrs. Brown alternately cooking meals and showing her guests her collection. Activities centered on a large attic archive built by Mr. Maciunas.  A 20th-Century Collection         In 1985, as the Jean Brown Archive approached 6,000 items, it was bought by the J. Paul Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, Calif. This was among the first collections of 20th-century material acquired by the center.         In addition to her son, an art historian at the Institute of Fine Arts in Manhattan, Mrs. Brown is survived by another son, Robert, of Manhattan, a partner in the Reinhold Brown Gallery.       
         Dr. Hanna Grunwald, a retired group psychotherapist and former director of Amnesty International U.S.A. in New York, died on May 15 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in Fairfield, Conn. She was 94 and had lived in Washington Heights until the late 1970's.         She had a long illness, Amnesty International said.         A native of Berlin, she received a doctorate at the University of Frankfurt and joined a resistance group shortly after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. She and her husband, Marcus, managed to flee to France, where she played a role in helping thousands of homeless refugee children.         French authorities deported the couple, who then were interned in Casablanca, spent a harsh 22 months in the Dominican Republic and finally arrived in New York with their young son in 1944. Dr. Grunwald worked as a file clerk but was able to obtain a master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work with the help of her employer. 2d Career at Amnesty Group         She spent many years helping troubled youths through the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service and other social-work agencies in the city. In the 1960's, she began to devote her evenings to volunteer work for Amnesty International.         She retired from her professional career in 1971 to join Amnesty and its board of directors, and led a group of local volunteers. She was named an honorary chairwoman of the organization in 1978, and later remained active at board meetings and in refugee committees.         Dr. Grunwald is survived by her son, George, of Benecia, Calif., and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1949 after a long illness contracted in a concentration camp in Germany.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Patricia Miller King, director of the Radcliffe College library devoted to the history of women, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. Dr. King, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., was 56.         The cause was lung cancer, a Radcliffe announcement said.         In 1973 she became director of the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe. In her 21-year tenure the library evolved into one of the nation's foremost centers for women's history. In 1993 the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation donated $2 million to endow the libarary's directorship.         Dr. King was also an officer of the National Council for Research on Women, the American Antiquarian Society and the Massachusetts Historical Society.         She graduated from Radcliffe in 1959 and received a doctorate in medieval history from Harvard University in 1970. As a graduate student she worked at the Women's Archives, a resource center that preceded the Schlesinger Library.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria King of Minneapolis, Ellen Stein-Samel of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Amy Stein of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Mark Stein of Hamilton, Mass.; her mother, Amy Miller, and a brother, Donald Miller, both of New Port Richey, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Bernstein, a trustee and president of the auxiliary of the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn from 1972 to 1990, died yesterday at her home in Bellport, L.I. She was 80.         The cause was complications from a stroke, said her son, Herbert Bernstein.         Mrs. Bernstein was active in community health programs in Brooklyn and in 1982 was given the Mayor's Volunteer Action Award for her work in health education and preventive medicine. She organized symposiums on nutrition, hypertension and nursing.         For more than 40 years she also served as the office manager for her husband, Dr. David Bernstein, a surgeon who practiced medicine in Brooklyn until his death in 1988. Mrs. Bernstein graduated from Brooklyn College in 1935.         She is survived by her son of Bellport; a daughter, Helen Young of Lawrenceville, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Natalia Danesi Murray, a publishing executive and book editor in New York from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on Thursday at her son's home in Del Mar, Calif. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement by the Helen Brann Agency.         Mrs. Murray was the head of the New York office of the Italian publishing house Mondadori in the 1950's. Later, she was the director of the New York office of Rizzoli, another Italian publisher, from the 1960's through the 1970's. She was instrumental in taking the works of American writers to Italian readers.         In 1985, Random House published "Darlinghissima: Letters to a Friend," by Janet Flanner, who, under the pseudonym Genet, wrote the "Letter From Paris" column in The New Yorker. Mrs.Murray, a longtime friend of Miss Flanner, edited the book and added commentary.         Mrs. Murray was born in Rome. In 1924 she married William Murray, the head of the William Morris Agency in New York, and moved to New York. They were divorced in 1936. Mrs. Murray acted on Broadway in the 1930's.         In World War II she helped NBC broadcast a short-wave news program to Italy.         She is survived by her son, William Murray, an author and foreign correspondent, and three grandchildren, all of Del Mar.       
         Natalia Danesi Murray, a publishing executive and book editor in New York from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on Thursday at her son's home in Del Mar, Calif. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement by the Helen Brann Agency.         Mrs. Murray was the head of the New York office of the Italian publishing house Mondadori in the 1950's. Later, she was the director of the New York office of Rizzoli, another Italian publisher, from the 1960's through the 1970's. She was instrumental in taking the works of American writers to Italian readers.         In 1985, Random House published "Darlinghissima: Letters to a Friend," by Janet Flanner, who, under the pseudonym Genet, wrote the "Letter From Paris" column in The New Yorker. Mrs.Murray, a longtime friend of Miss Flanner, edited the book and added commentary.         Mrs. Murray was born in Rome. In 1924 she married William Murray, the head of the William Morris Agency in New York, and moved to New York. They were divorced in 1936. Mrs. Murray acted on Broadway in the 1930's.         In World War II she helped NBC broadcast a short-wave news program to Italy.         She is survived by her son, William Murray, an author and foreign correspondent, and three grandchildren, all of Del Mar.       
         Edith K. Bergtraum, a teacher at Public School 143 in Corona, Queens, for 25 years, died on Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. Mrs. Bergtraum, who lived in Kew Garden Hills, Queens, was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Bergtraum.         Mrs. Bergtraum, a graduate of Hunter College, taught at the elementary school from 1960 to 1985. In 1974 she became a member of Community School Board District 25 in Flushing and served for 19 years. She had also served since 1973 as a member of the New York City Commission on the Status of Women.         She is survived by two daughters: Judith of Kew Garden Hills and Marcia Williams of Lake Success, L.I.; a son, Howard, of Old Westbury, L.I., and two sisters, Janice Sommer of Roslyn, L.I., and Pearl Schenkler of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Mary Anne Devanna, an associate dean at the Columbia University Business School, died on Saturday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was leukemia, said Maryann Hedaa, an associate professor at the business school.         Dr. Devanna earned her Ph.D. in human resources management from the Columbia Business School in 1982. Beginning in 1988, she was named a research professor and an associate dean, becoming one of the highest-ranking women at the school.         Previously, she was director of executive education at the school and, earlier, an advertising executive.         She was co-author of the book "The Transformational Leader: Molding Tomorrow's Corporate Winners," published in 1986. She was also the author or co-author of several other books and wrote numerous articles for journals in the human resource management field.         Dr. Devanna was born in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree from St. John's University in 1960 and a master's degree in business administration from the Columbia Business School in 1974.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a son, Joseph R., of Boston; two daughters, Eva M. Grizell of Boston and Nichole Devanna of Ardsley; two grandchildren, and a sister, Barbara Schwab of Mount Laurel, N.J.       
         Rosemarie Brancato Rothman, a coloratura soprano, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Dr. Peter M. Rothman.         Mrs. Rothman, who used her maiden name in performance, made her debut with the Chicago Civic Opera in 1934, as Gilda in "Rigoletto." She sang with the Cincinnati Summer Opera and made nationwide concert tours. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1946, as Violetta in "La Traviata" and was heard regularly on the radio. She later sang leading roles with the Detroit Civic Light Opera and at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.         In addition to her son, of Fort Wayne, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Dr. Lester D. Rothman; a brother, Matthew, and a sister, Josephine Bono, both of Kansas City, and a grandson, Wilson J. Rothman.       
         Dr. Gladys W. Natchez, a retired professor of education at City College of New York, died on Sunday at her home in Walnut Creek, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Meryl Rafferty.         Dr. Natchez was an authority on children's reading disabilities and she wrote several professional texts on the subject. She also was in the private practice of psychology in Manhattan and Mamaroneck, N.Y., until she retired in 1990.         Dr. Natchez received a doctorate in education from New York University and also studied psychology as a post-doctoral fellow at Adelphi University. While at that school she conducted a series of video interviews with noted psychotherapists that are collected in the Demer Institute Library.         She is survived by her daughter of Lafayette, Calif.; her son, Dan Natchez of Mamaroneck, and six grandchildren.       
         Barbara Howell, a feminist novelist and short story writer, died on Tuesday in Lenox Hill Hospital. Ms. Howell, who lived in Manhattan, was 57.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Alan Woltz.         Ms. Howell was the author of the novels "Joy Ride" (Viking, 1989) and "A Mere Formality" (M. Evans, 1984) and the nonfiction book "Don't Bother to Come in on Monday" (St. Martin's, 1973). She also wrote extensively for such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Vogue.         She graduated from Barat College in Lake Forest, Ill., and was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Lille in 1957.         She is survived by her husband and a son, William Leroy, both of Manhattan.         Correction:  June 10, 1994, Friday         An obituary headline on Thursday about Barbara Howell, a novelist and short-story writer, misstated her age. She was 57, not 59.       
         Marion Williams, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Saturday at the Albert Einstein Medical Institute in Philadelphia. She was 66 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was vascular disease, said her record producer, Anthony Heilbut.         Miss Williams was a flamboyant singer who put her songs across with pure sustained tones, swooping phrases and deep growls. Her influence was heard throughout gospel music and in secular music as well. Little Richard has said her octave-leaping high whoops were the source for his vocals in "Tutti Frutti" and other songs, and Aretha Franklin recorded Miss Williams's two biggest hits, "Packin' Up" and "Surely God Is Able." Miss Williams performed in churches, at concerts and in nightclubs, and in 1993 she received a MacArthur Foundation grant and was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.         "When I'm singing, I get inspired by God," she said in a 1980 interview with The New York Times. "I call it 'the anointing.' It's an extra-special thing. When the inspiration of God is missing, I just rely on talent." In Church and on Broadway         Miss Williams was born in Miami in 1927 and grew up singing in sanctified churches, although she was also exposed to blues and jazz. In 1947 she joined the Clara Ward Singers, the preeminent gospel group of the 1950's, and soon became the lead singer. In 1958 she and other members of the Ward Singers started their own group, the Stars of Faith, and in 1961 they appeared on Broadway in "Black Nativity," a gospel musical by Langston Hughes.         Miss Williams began performing as a soloist in the mid-1960's, appearing at churches and colleges and touring the world. In 1966 the State Department sponsored her tour of Africa. She recorded for Savoy, Vee Jay, Columbia and Atlantic Records from the 1950's through the 1970's. In 1976, her album "Prayer Changes Things" won a Grand Prix du Disque in France.         In 1980, she made her first appearance in a club serving alcohol, singing a celebrated long engagement at the Cookery in Greenwich Village. From the mid-1980's onward, she made albums for Spirit Feel Records. She was active at the B. M. Oakley Memorial Church of God in Christ, in Philadelphia, as both a church mother and an occasional performer.         Miss Williams began to undergo dialysis regularly in 1988, but she continued to perform. In December 1991 she sang "Amazing Grace" in a Public Broadcasting Service program about the song. She appeared in the 1992 film "Fried Green Tomatoes," which was dedicated to her, and was the guest soloist in 1992 for the premiere of Wynton Marsalis's gospel-influenced jazz suite "In This House/On This Morning." On April 28 this year, she was inducted into the Philadelphia Walk of Fame.         Miss Williams is survived by her son, Robin, of Philadelphia; a brother, Isaac, of Miami, and three grandchildren.       
         Merriam Modell, a writer of short stories and suspense novels, died on July 1 at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 86.         The cause was pulmonary embolism, the result of a recent accident, said her son, John.         Mrs. Modell, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym Evelyn Piper, created dozens of stories and novels, some of which were made into movies. Among them are "Bunny Lake Is Missing," with Laurence Olivier and Carol Lynley, and "The Nanny," which starred Bette Davis.         Mrs. Modell's first stories appeared in The New Yorker in the early 1940's, and several novels followed, among them "The Sound of Years" (1946) and "My Sister, My Bride" (1948). Many had a common theme: the domestic conflicts faced by American families.         Among her other works are "The Innocent" (1949), "The Motive" (1950), "The Plot" (1951) and "The Lady and Her Doctor" (1956).         She is survived by two grandchildren, in addition to her son.       
         Margie Pitts Hames, an Atlanta civil rights lawyer who argued a companion case to the better-known Roe v. Wade, in which the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right to have an abortion, died on Tuesday night while driving her car in Atlanta. She was 60.         According to the police there, she suffered a heart attack, and her car went off the road and into a parking lot. She was pronounced dead at Piedmont Hospital a short while later.         Ms. Hames argued Doe v. Bolton, a suit from Georgia concerning restrictions on sites where abortions could be performed, which ran parallel to Roe v. Wade, a Texas case. The Supreme Court ruled on the two cases on Jan. 22, 1973. Ms. Hames called the decision "a cornerstone for liberating women."         Born in Milton, Tenn., she was a legal secretary when she started studying law at Middle Tennessee State University. She transferred to Vanderbilt University, where she earned bachelor's and law degrees.         She started practicing law in 1962, specializing in labor-management relations. She ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia Supreme Court 12 years ago.         Ms. Hames and several other Atlanta lawyers put the Doe v. Bolton case together in 1970 as a constitutional challenge to Georgia's abortion law. "Doe," like "Roe," was a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who had been unable to get a legal abortion. Ms. Hames was the main lawyer in the case when it came before the United States Supreme Court.         She was less successful in another instance as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. A lawsuit filed in 1972 sought to end persistent segregation in the Atlanta schools by busing pupils across city, county and district lines in a six-county region. The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that there was no basis for ordering such a sweeping busing plan.         Ms. Hames's survivors include a son, Adam, and a daughter, Donia.       
         Ann McGarry Buchwald, wife of the columnist Art Buchwald and an author and former literary agent, died on Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 74.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         In the 1970's Mrs. Buchwald was a Washington partner of Irving Lazar, one of Hollywood's top literary and talent agents. But in 1974, after Mr. Lazar agreed to try to sell the memoirs of former President Richard M. Nixon, Mrs. Buchwald ended her partnership, citing a conflict of principle because her husband had written many satirical columns about Watergate and Mr. Nixon.         Besides her autobiography, "Seems Like Yesterday," Mrs. Buchwald was the co-author of "White Gloves and Party Manners" (Robert B. Luce, 1965) and "Stand Up, Shake Hands, Say 'How Do You Do' " (Robert B. Luce, 1969).         Mrs. Buchwald, who was born in Warren, Pa., was also a fashion coordinator for Neiman-Marcus in Dallas, and later was a publicity director for Pierre Balmain in Paris. In 1950, while still in Paris, she opened a public relations firm. She met Mr. Buchwald there the same year, and they married in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Connie Marks of Culpeper, Va., and Jennifer Buchwald of Boston; a son, Joel, of Denver; three grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers.       
         Jane Preddy, an architectural historian specializing in theatrical architecture, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Wappingers Falls, N.Y.         The cause was injuries suffered in an automobile accident, said her son, Phil D. Carroll.         Ms. Preddy was the founder of Architecture on Stage, a foundation for the study of theaters in New York, and an expert on the life on John Eberson, who designed many Art Deco theaters. Her first show as the director of the gallery at the City College School of Architecture was devoted to New York's theaters of the 1930's. A member of the City Municipal Art Society and several theater restoration groups, she also taught at City College and lectured around Manhattan.         In addition to her son, of Austin, Tex., she is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Mary C. McDonald, a retired assistant director of continuing education for the New York City schools, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Centre, L.I. She was 83.         The cause was chronic kidney failure, her family said.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. McDonald graduated from Hunter College and Columbia University Teachers College. She took a job as a substitute teacher during the Depression, then in the mid-1930's became the Department of Parks director of recreation for Queens.         She returned to the Board of Education in 1948 and specialized in adult literacy and English as a second language. She was also a consultant to the State Division of Higher Education, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Governments of Egypt and Greece. She retired from the school system in 1971.         Mrs. McDonald is survived by a son, Dr. Brian F. of Rockville Centre; a sister, Anna Gordon of Bayside, Queens, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 34 years, F. Joseph McDonald, died in 1983.       
         Anne Freeman Turpin, a retired director of special learning at St. Bernard's School in Manhattan, died yesterday at her home in Richmond. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Douglas Ochs Adler.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Turpin worked with children who had learning problems. She began her teaching career at the Birch Wathen Lenox School in Manhattan in 1971, and moved in 1977 to St. Bernard's School, from which she retired in 1992.         Mrs. Turpin, a native of Richmond, lived in Manhattan for 45 years after her graduation from Vassar College in 1945. In 1970, she received a master's degree from Teachers College at Columbia University.         She was the daughter of Douglas Southall Freeman, the editor of The Richmond News Leader and a biographer of George Washington and Robert E. Lee.         She is survived by her husband, A. Royall Turpin Jr. of Richmond; her son, of Takoma Park, Md.; two daughters, Anne Adler Tarbell and Mary Ballard Malhotra, both of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Katherine Turpin Gnugnoli of Washington and Mary Turpin Barradale of Richmond; a sister, Mary Tyler McClenahan of Richmond; a brother, James Douglas Freeman of Richmond, and three grandchildren.       
         Nancy Lancaster, an American-born socialite who had been an international influence on interior and garden design since the 1920's, died on Friday at her home near Little Haseley, Oxfordshire, England. She was 96.         She died in her sleep after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Lady Anne Tree.         A native of Virginia who moved to England in 1926, Nancy Lancaster was instrumental in creating what is popularly known as the English-country look. This school of interior decoration is characterized by sun-bleached chintz, vibrant wall colors, a casual mix of furniture from various historical periods and an atmosphere of disheveled coziness. John Fowler, Mrs. Lancaster's partner in the London design firm of Colefax & Fowler, called it "pleasing decay."         According to Robert Becker, whose biography of Mrs. Lancaster is to be published by Alfred A. Knopf next year, it was an esthetic fueled by memories of Southern plantation houses that had fallen into romantic disrepair after the Civil War. Among these was her grandfather's estate, Mirador, near Charlottesville. 'An Abstract Nostalgia'         "It was an abstract nostalgia that was particularly appealing to the British upper classes," Mr. Becker said. "Thanks to two world wars, they were losing their way of life, too, just as the Virginians had."         Born in 1897, Nancy Keene Perkins was a daughter of Lizzie Langhorne and T. Moncure Perkins, a meatpacking executive. Orphaned at the age of 15, she was raised by her aunt, Irene Langhorne Gibson, a celebrated beauty who was the original Gibson Girl, a symbol of American womanhood at the turn of the century. Another Langhorne aunt was Nancy, Viscountess Astor, the first woman elected to the House of Commons.         Though Mrs. Lancaster was co-owner of Colefax & Fowler from 1944 to the mid-1980's, she was not a professional decorator. "I'm agin decoratin'," she once said in a Tidewater drawl that remained undimmed after more than 65 years away from home. "I'm a percolator of ideas." The appearance of her own homes -- notably her London apartment's butter-yellow drawing room, completed in 1958 -- inspired generations of designers in Europe and the United States. Her followers include Sister Parish, Mark Hampton and Mario Buatta.         "She brought American vitality to stuffy British houses, which often looked like museums," Mr. Buatta said. "After Nancy blew into town, England loosened up and started looking more personal and lived-in." Cultivator of Roses         Mrs. Lancaster also revived interest in old-fashioned roses, which she cultivated at Ditchley Park, a 3,000-acre estate in Oxfordshire that was her home from 1933 to 1947. One of her last homes, Haseley Court, was the subject of a 1993 BBC television documentary, "An Englishwoman's Garden." She also advised on the restoration of Stratford Hall, a Virginia home of a relative, Robert E. Lee.         Nancy Lancaster's first husband was Henry Field, a grandson of Marshall Field, the department-store magnate. He died in 1918, six months after their wedding. Two years later, she married another Field grandson, Ronald Lambert Tree, who later became a Conservative member of Parliament. They divorced in 1947. She later wed another British politician, Col. Claud G. Lancaster. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Sought after by leading artists and photographers -- John Singer Sargent, Cecil Beaton, Baron De Meyer and Horst P. Horst all paid homage -- Mrs. Lancaster was a popular hostess for guests from American diplomats to the King and Queen of England.         Between 1940 and 1942, Winston Churchill spent many weekends at Ditchley Park, which was considered safer from Axis bombers than the Prime Minister's official country residence, Chequers.         In addition to her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lancaster is survived by a son, Michael Tree; a sister, Alice Winn; and two granddaughters, all of London.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on Sunday at her summer home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 78.         Dr. Coser, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of kidney failure, her family said.         She taught at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987, after which she moved to Cambridge. At her death she was an adjunct professor of sociology at Boston College, specializing in the family and medical sociology.         She was born in Berlin and reared in Belgium; she came to the United States in 1939. She started studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research but switched to sociology at Columbia University, where she earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert K. Merton. Taught Sociology at Harvard         Dr. Coser began her teaching career as an instructor at Wellesley College. In 1959 she began teaching at the Harvard University Medical School as an assistant professor of sociology in the department of psychiatry, and later became an associate professor. She also taught at Northeastern University in Boston.         She was the author of "Life in the Ward" (1962) and was involved as a contributor to or editor of "Sociological Studies of Health and Sickness" (1960), "Studies in the Hospital" (1963) and "The Family, Its Structure and Functions" (revised in 1974).         Her recent writing includes "Training in Ambiguity: Learning Through Doing in a Mental Hospital" (1979), "In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy" (1991) and "Laughter Among Colleagues" (1993). All three books remain in print.         Dr. Coser is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Lewis A. Coser, also a sociologist; a daughter, Dr. Ellen C. Perrin of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Steven M. of Melrose, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Rosa Chacel, a Spanish writer of complex, intellectual novels and poetry, who was in exile during most of the Franco era, died on Wednesday in the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. She was 96 and lived in Madrid.         The cause was heart and lung failure, hospital officials said.         An English translation of one of her most widely read novels, "Memoirs of Leticia Valle," won praise when it was published earlier this year by the University of Nebraska Press in a translation by Carol Maier, a professor of Spanish at Kent State University. The work originally appeared in Spanish 49 years ago in Buenos Aires.         Susan Kirkpatrick, a professor of Spanish at the University of California at San Diego, wrote, in the preface to her translation of Miss Chacel's novel "The Maravillas District," which was published in 1992 by the University of Nebraska Press: "Chacel's writing is dense and labyrinthine, but at the same time it is open-ended and dynamic, shaping a narrative design that ends with a query instead of a conclusion."         Miss Chacel (pronounced cha-THELL) was born in Valladolid, in north-central Spain, on June 3, 1898. She studied art in Madrid and spent six years in Rome, where she wrote her first novel, "Season of Departure and Return," which was published in Spain in 1930.         In 1938, as Gen. Francisco Franco drew close to victory in the Spanish Civil War, she fled to South America, where dozens of Spanish intellectuals were in exile. She left Spain largely because her husband, Timoteo Perez Rubio, had been active on the Republican side, and her sympathies were also with the Republic. She spent her 36 years in exile mainly in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.         From 1959 to 1961, Miss Chacel was in New York City on a Guggenheim Fellowship and wrote a book of literary and philosophical essays, "Saturnalia," which was published in 1972. Over the years, she wrote more than a dozen books, including novels and volumes of poetry and of essays. She returned to Spain in the early 1970's, not long before Franco's death.         In the weeks before her death, while Miss Chacel was in the hospital, she was awarded Spain's Gold Medal for Fine Arts by King Juan Carlos.         Miss Chacel's husband died in 1977. She is survived by a son, Carlos Perez Chacel.         Correction:  August 4, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Rosa Chacel, a Spanish novelist, misidentified the author of the English translation of her book "The Maravillas District," published in 1992 by the University of Nebraska Press. It was translated by D. A. Demers, not Susan Kirkpatrick.       
         Donna Kay Price, a Westchester County real estate executive and former director of the Lighthouse for the Blind of New York and Westchester, died on Saturday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Waccabuc, N.Y.         Mrs. Price died of head injuries suffered in a fall at her home, her family said.         Mrs. Price, who was blind, was a longtime fund-raiser for the Seeing Eye Inc. in Morristown, N.J., which trains guide dogs for the blind. She was a past member of the board of the Lighthouse Inc. of New York and its Westchester division.         "She was a devoted supporter of services to people with visual impairments in the Hudson Valley," said Judith Millman, the organization's regional director in White Plains. Started in Advertising         Born in Terre Haute, Ind., Mrs. Price was a Phi Beta Kappa history graduate of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. She worked briefly in advertising before making her career in real estate. She was associated for 33 years with Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate of Bronxville, N.Y., most recently as a vice president and manager of the Katonah, N.Y., and Bedford, N.Y., offices.         In an interview three years ago, Mrs. Price said she was a diabetic and lost her sight completely over a period of two years, beginning about 1973.         "In the 1970's, they didn't know what to do with diabetes and eyesight problems," she said. "Now they have a pretty good chance of saving the eyesight with lasers."         She said she turned to the Lighthouse when her sight began to fail and remained associated with them ever since.         Mrs. Price is survived by her husband, Kenneth W., of Waccabuc; a daughter, Darcy Lee Price of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Timothy of Port Jervis, N.Y.; and a sister, Barbara Lee Crowder of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Edwina d'Erlanger, the widow of Baron Leo d'Erlanger, died Aug. 18 in a hospital in Geneva, where she had lived since 1975. She was 87.         The cause of death was a stroke, according to her sister, Mary Whelan Prue Warburg.         Mrs. d'Erlanger, who modeled and was a professional dancer in Europe in her youth, became a well-known hostess in London during her marriage to the baron, whose title was German but whose family had lived in England since the 19th century.         The former Edwina Prue was born in New York City but spent most of her childhood on a ranch in New Mexico. At 17, she returned to New York with her family and worked for Clare Boothe Luce as a junior editor at Vanity Fair magazine.         Later, she was chosen to model for the haute-couture house of Jean Patou in Paris. She stayed on in Europe to perform as a ballroom dancer under the name Edwina Saint Clair.         On her return to New York, she was the understudy for June Walker in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," leaving to be married to Baron d'Erlanger in 1929. The couple divided their time between London and Tunis.         She was married for more than 50 years to the Baron, who died 10 years ago.         She is survived by a son, Rodolphe, of London; a daughter, Tess d'Erlanger, of Oxford, England; three grandsons, and her sister, of Wilton, Conn..         She was buried in Geneva.       
         Sylvia S. Goldstein, a teacher and administrator in New York City public schools for almost half a century, died on Saturday in the Sarah Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck. Mrs. Goldstein, who lived in Lido Beach, L.I., was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Claire Meadow, of Larchmont, N.Y.         A graduate of Hunter College, Mrs. Goldstein received a master's degree in education from New York University. She began her teaching career in 1932 at Junior High School 139 in the Bronx, and retired in 1980 as principal of Public School 217 in Brooklyn.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Goldstein is survived by a son, Herbert Samuelson of Metuchen, N.J., and five grandchildren.       
         Nomi Mitty, an actress who appeared on stage and in films and television, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Mitty began her career as a child, appearing on Broadway with Shirley Booth in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" in 1951. She played Gertrude Berg's daughter on the popular radio show "The Goldbergs" and toured with Mercedes McCambridge in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and with Edward Everett Horton in "Harvey."         Her television credits included guest appearances on "Hill Street Blues," "Picket Fences," "Knot's Landing" and "L.A. Law." Among her films were "Serpico" and "Melvyn and Howard."         She is survived by her husband, Robert Kaylor; a son, Ross; two stepdaughters, Robin and Sarah, and three brothers and a sister.       
         Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, for nearly two decades the dean of New York University's School of Social Work, died yesterday at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokeswoman.         Dr. Ehrenkranz, who was credited with enhancing the school's national reputation, joined its staff in 1966 and became its dean in 1977. In her more than 17 years as dean, the school became one of the largest schools of social work in the nation, enrolling more than 1,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs.         Under her leadership, the school also pioneered the holistic approach to clinical social work and became the first institution in the New York metropolitan area to offer a doctorate in clinical social work.         In recognition of her contributions, New York University had announced that the school would be renamed the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work. Jay Oliva, president of the university, said yesterday that there would be a renaming ceremony on Sept. 19. Was a Former Caseworker         Dr. Ehrenkranz received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, master's degrees in English from Temple University, in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr College and in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.         Before joining New York University, she served as a field instructor at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work and a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Social Work. She was also a caseworker and case supervisor in agencies for families and children. She was president of the New York State Association of Deans in 1980-81 and 1988-89.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Kasoff; two daughters, Pamela Ehrenkranz of New York City and Jean LeGrand of Chicago; a sister, Babette Cohen of Rosyln Heights, L.I., and 16 grandchildren.         Correction:  August 27, 1994, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, omitted a survivor. He is her son, Dr. Joel Ehrenkranz of New Vernon, N.J.       
         Valerie Worth Bahlke, a poet and novelist for young readers, died on Sunday at her home in Clinton, N.Y. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bahlke, who wrote under her maiden name, Valerie Worth, had many interests, from astronomy to gardening to meditation, which became the subject matter she wove into her poetry. She sought to present ordinary things in a fresh way.         She was most widely known for her "small poems" for children, composed in simple free verse. The poet and teacher Myra Cohn Livingston wrote of Ms. Worth's work in The New York Times Book Review in 1988, "The treasures Ms. Worth offers do not lie in some distant, golden land but in the everyday world." For example, of a safety pin, Ms. Worth wrote:         Closed, it sleeps         On its side         Quietly,         The silver         Image         Of some         Small fish;         Opened, it snaps         Its tail out         Like a thin         Shrimp, and looks         At the sharp         Point with a         Surprised eye.         In 1991, the National Council of Teachers of English honored her with its Poetry Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children, given for a body of work.         It was only one of many such citations she garnered over the years. Since the 1950's, her poems have been included in numerous anthologies. She also wrote fiction for adults and young people. 'Small Poems' by the Volume         She was born in Philadelphia and lived in Swarthmore, Pa., Tampa, Fla., and Bangalore, India, when her father, a biologist at Swarthmore College, was asked to go to India to study malaria. She graduated from Swarthmore in 1955.         After settling in Clinton, she joined an informal writing group at Kirkland College and met Natalie Babbitt, an author and illustrator who then furnished the black-and-white drawings for her work, starting with "Small Poems" in 1972. Three more volumes followed, in 1976, 1978 and 1985, and all four appeared in a single paperback in 1987.         Her other books included "The Crone's Book of Words" (1971) and "The Crone's Book of Wisdom" (1988); "Curlicues: The Fortunes of Two Pug Dogs" (1980), and two novels for young adults, "Gypsy Gold" (1983) and "Fox Hill" (1986).         Another book of her verses for children, "At Christmastime," was published two years ago. Much of her work remains in print, and at her death she had completed two more such collections of all-new poems. They are scheduled for publication by HarperCollins in 1995 and 1996.         She is survived by her husband, George W. Bahlke; a son, Conrad D., of Hoboken, N.J.; two daughters, Catherine B. Hornstein of Brooklyn and Margaret B. Diskin of West Chester, Pa.; two brothers, Michael Worth of Swarthmore and Douglas Worth of Newton, Mass., and a granddaughter.       
         Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn, the mother of Van Cliburn and his only piano teacher until he was 17, died yesterday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth. She was 97 and lived in Fort Worth.         The cause was a stroke that occurred last Thursday, said Mary Lou Falcone, Mr. Cliburn's spokeswoman.         Mrs. Cliburn's mother was an actress and her father was a judge and adviser to state officials. She studied music from an early age in Texas, then at the Cincinnati Conservatory and at the New York School of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         She returned to Texas in the 1920's to marry Harvey Levan Cliburn, an oil-company executive. She gave piano lessons, and discovered her son's ability when at the age of 3 he went to the piano after one of her students left and played by ear the piece that had just been taught.         Mrs. Cliburn served as her son's adviser, manager and inspiration throughout his career. She was also active in the arts, and established a foundation to help young performers.         Her husband died in 1974. She is survived by her son, of Fort Worth.       
         Miriam K. Carliner, a Federal specialist on poverty and sexual bias in education, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 73.         The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.         A native of Bad Kreuznach, Germany, Mrs. Carliner migrated to the United States as a teen-ager and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1942 from George Washington University.         She dealt with problems of disadvantaged students in the District of Columbia school system and directed a study by the League of Women Voters that examined the allocation of resources among the schools of neighborhoods in the District in 1965.         In 1964 and 1965, she coordinated a conference for 27,000 people involved in Head Start, the early-education program for disadvantaged children.         As a senior program officer in the United States Office of Education, she oversaw demonstration projects aimed at the disadvantaged.         In 1980, Mrs. Carliner was appointed to direct the Woman's Action Program of the Department of Health and Human Services. She reported on sex discrimination in the department and assessed programs affecting women.         After she left the Government in 1985, she became a mediator for the District of Columbia's Superior Court and sat on the District's Civilian Complaint Review Board.         Mrs. Carliner is survived by her husband of 50 years, David; a son, Geoffrey, of West Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Deborah Carliner of Washington; a brother, Karl Kalter of Munich, and four grandchildren.       
         Edith Sherin Markson, a promoter of regional theater in the United States and the founder of an exchange program for American and Eastern European theater artists, died on Saturday during a visit to Santa Fe, N.M. She was 81 and lived in New York City.         The cause was heart failure after a stroke, said her daughter, Mary Markson Dawe.         In the 1950's Mrs. Markson was among the founders of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, and she later helped found the American Conservatory Theater in Pittsburgh before the company moved to San Francisco in 1967; until 1980, she was vice president of the theater's board.         Mrs. Markson also created the Theater International Exchange Services Foundation, an organization that arranged for collaborations, both here and abroad, between American theater artists and administrators and their counterparts in Eastern Europe.         In addition to Mrs. Dawe, of Milwaukee, she is survived by a son, Simpson Markson of New Jersey; a brother, the producer and director Edwin Sherin of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara Fassbinder, one of the first health care professionals to be infected with the AIDS virus while on the job, died on Tuesday at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. She was 40 and lived in Monona, Iowa.         The cause was complications from AIDS, the hospital said.         Mrs. Fassbinder was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1986 while helping treat a patient in the emergency room of Memorial Hospital in Prairie du Chien, Wis.         While she was pressing gauze on a needle puncture, the patient's blood apparently mingled with her blood through small cuts on her hand from gardening, she said in 1990. The young man died, and an autopsy showed he had AIDS. But it was not until January 1987, when she tried to make a blood donation, that she discovered she had been infected.         She and her family kept the infection a secret until she decided to speak out in 1990. "My biggest fear was how the community would react to me and my kids and my husband," she said at a news conference in Iowa City in which she told her story in the hope that it would warn other health-care workers. The 1,500 people of Monona, a farming community in northeastern Iowa, gave her family "nothing but support," she said at the time.         Dr. Michael Osterholm, an AIDS expert and epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health who became a friend of her family, said she "helped bridge the gap between the worlds of the health care provider and the AIDS patient in need of competent and compassionate care like no one else could."         Mrs. Fassbinder traveled extensively, talking to people about AIDS and how to prevent infection by H.I.V., Dr. Osterholm said. She testified about AIDS before Congress, and in 1992 she was recognized by the Surgeon General and the Department of Health and Human Services for her work.         A native of Marion, Ohio, she also served on the National Health Care Reform Committee set up by Hillary Rodham Clinton and was a member of the Iowa State Commission on AIDS, Dr. Osterholm said.         She is survived by her husband, David; two daughters, Eva and Emily, and a son, Joel, all of Monona; her parents, James and Ethel Herring, of Marion, Iowa; three sisters, Kathryn Fassbinder, of Elgin, Iowa, Mary Walston of Kewaunee, Wis., and Susan Valleire of Rock Island, Ill.; four brothers, J. Stephen Herring of Idaho Falls, Idaho, Edward Herring, of Rockford, Ill., Mark Herring, of Manitowoc, Wis., and John Herring of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a grandmother, Martha McElroy of Creston, Iowa.       
         Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.         The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.         Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.         Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.         Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.       
         Barbara Drew Hoffstot, an architectural and community preservationist, died on Sept. 18 at her Pittsburgh home. She was 75 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla.; New Waterford, Ohio, and County Galway, Ireland.         She died after a long illness, The Palm Beach, Fla., Post reported.         At her death, Mrs. Hoffstot was a vice president of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach and vice chairwoman of the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, two groups that she helped found. She had served as co-chairwoman of Palm Beach's first Landmarks Preservation Commission and had drafted landmarks preservation legislation for that city. She was a former trustee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.         Her writings included the book "Landmark Architecture of Palm Beach," which was published in 1974 and has been twice revised.         Mrs. Hoffstot, whose family has spent winters in Palm Beach for three generations, was born Barbara S. Drew in Pittsburgh, graduated from the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., and attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, Henry Phipps Hoffstot Jr.; a daughter, Thayer of Westlake Village, Calif.; a son, Henry Phipps 3d of Ligonier, Pa., and New York, and four grandchildren.       
         Margaret Brown Klapthor, an expert on White House history and a former department chairman at the Smithsonian Institution, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 72.         The cause was stomach cancer, said a son, Paul Edward Klapthor of Sumter, S.C.         Mrs. Klapthor retired from the Smithsonian in 1983. She first went to work there as a scientific aide in 1943, and rose through the curatorial ranks in its divisions of civil and political history, becoming curator of the Smithsonian's First Ladies collection and chairman of the institution's department of national and military history.         Among her writings is the historical text in "The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States," an illustrated volume of historical lore and recipes. It was published for Parents' Magazine Press in 1965, and went through several editions.         The book was praised by Craig Claiborne, then the food critic for The New York Times, who called it "perhaps the most comprehensive and detailed volume ever written" about "what American Presidents and their wives have dined on."         It reported, for example, that Ulysses S. Grant personally selected the wines to be served at formal dinners, "though his own glass was usually turned down"; that Chester A. Arthur was an epicure who savored fine wines, and that William McKinley's taste ran to fried potatoes, bacon and eggs, johnnycakes and cherry pie.         Mrs. Klapthor also wrote "First Ladies" (sixth edition 1990, White House Historical Society) and was a co-author, with her father, Paul D. Brown, of "The History of Charles County, Maryland," in 1958.         She gave lectures on White House history that detailed the occupants' idiosyncrasies, like Dolley Madison's conversational icebreaker of reading a passage from whatever book she was carrying at the time.         In the 1950's, when Mrs. Klapthor was in charge of the gowns of White House hostesses, she discovered Dolley Madison's inauguration gown, which had been kept by heirs. She traced it to the William Rockwell Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the gallery then sent it to the Smithsonian on indefinite loan.         As associate curator in the division of political history, Mrs. Klapthor assembled a Smithsonian collection of White House china in connection with her creation of First Ladies Hall, a modernized setting for the Smithsonian's First Ladies costume collection.         Sometimes she talked about more recent First Ladies. In 1988, commenting on reports of summit talk tiffs between Nancy Reagan and Raisa M. Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet leader, Mrs. Klapthor said in an interview in The Times, "It struck me as something that had been manufactured by the press."         Mrs. Klapthor was born in Henderson, Ky., reared in Charles County and graduated from the University of Maryland.         In the last 21 years she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and was confined to a wheelchair for the last two years. Her husband, Frank Edward Klapthor, died earlier this year.         Besides her son Paul, she is survived by another son, Carlson Brown Klapthor of Washington; a daughter, Frances Andrews of Baltimore; a sister, Mary Berry Moore of Port Tobacco, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Joy Ungerleider-Mayerson, a former director of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her son Andrew Ungerleider.         At her death, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was president of the Dorot Foundation, whose interests include biblical archeology and Jewish education. She was also the chairman of the Albright Institute for archeological research in Jerusalem and served on the boards of other cultural and educational institutions. She was the director of the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street, from 1972 to 1980, after being a curator there from 1967 to 1969.         In 1971, criticized for neglect of its Judaica collection and facing a substantial deficit, the museum's board decided that the institution should devote itself to "a commitment to the Jewish community." The museum was shut during that year, and Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson has been praised as having subsequently rescued it from its doldrums. She shifted the museum's focus from art to Jewish culture, instituting a strong education program and creating popular exhibitions on the subject of Israel and biblical archeology.         As a philanthropist, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was instrumental in providing support, through family foundations, for the New York Public Library. She was the author of one book, "Jewish Folk Art from the Biblical Period to Modern Times" (1986) and the co-author of another, "The Museums of Israel" (Abrams, 1989).         Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson, who was born in Lawrence, L.I., received a B.A. from New York University in 1942 and a master's degree in Hebrew Studies from New York University in 1971. She was married to Samuel Ungerleider in 1945; he died in 1972.         In addition to her sons Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Peter, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. Steven Ungerleider of Eugene, Ore.; three daughters, Jeane Ungerleider-Springer of Boston, Miriam Mayerson-Michael of Manhattan and Clare Benac-Mayerson of Paris; two sisters, Celeste G. Bartos of Manhattan and Miriam G. Wallach of Scarsdale, N.Y., and seven grandchildren       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Faith Cardwell Davis, who with her sisters Hope Cardwell Brock and Charity Cardwell Lawson had been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest complete set of triplets, died on Sunday at Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital in Sweetwater, Tex. She was 95.         The cause of death was believed to be a heart attack, said Dan McCoy, director of McCoy Funeral Home in Sweetwater.         The three sisters had lived together for more than a decade at a nursing home in Sweetwater, a small city on the plains of West Texas.         Several experts on multiple births said that when the Cardwell sisters turned 95 last May, they were the first set of triplets on record to reach that age.         Mrs. Davis had owned and operated the Silver Spur diner in Roby, Tex., for 25 years before moving to nearby Sweetwater in the early 1980's.         Her husband, J. P. Davis, whom she married in 1920, died in 1980, and her son, James, died in 1986. She is survived by her sisters; two granddaughters, and three great-grandsons.       
         Marcia Lawrence, who retired in January after 25 years as the director of communications for Planned Parenthood of New York City, died on Thursday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         Beginning in 1968, Ms. Lawrence served as the chief writer for the organization, producing training manuals, public-service advertising and other written materials.         Her duties included informing the public about birth control and where to find services. In 1969, she wrote a comprehensive publication on family planning, "Yes, You Can," which the city bought in bulk for general distribution when New York State rewrote its abortion law the next year. It covered information on contraception, sterilization, adoption and abortion.         In 1971, Ms. Lawrence wrote a consumer guide, "Birth Control: All the Methods That Work and the Ones That Don't," which was sold to agencies nationwide. She edited a book-length guide to legal abortion services based on Planned Parenthood services in New York. It appeared in 1973, the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion.         Ms. Lawrence also created a campaign that persuaded the Yellow Pages to mention birth-control and abortion services in her agency's display ads. Starting in the mid-1970's, she composed the texts for full-page advocacy advertisements published in national newspapers. In 1984, she successfully campaigned for an increase in state appropriations for contraceptive services and consumer education on that subject.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Barnard College. She was a vestry member of the Episcopal Church of St. Luke-in-the-Fields in Greenwich Village. She was also a trustee of St. Luke's School.         Ms. Lawrence, who used her maiden name, is survived by a daughter, Alison Collins of Kew Gardens, Queens, and a son, Charles Collins of Forest Hills, Queens.       
         Kaleria Fedicheva, a former ballerina with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad who taught and staged the classics in the United States, died on Sept. 13 in Maribor, Slovenia, where she had been seeking medical treatment. She was 58 years old and lived in Glen Cove, L.I.         Ms. Fedicheva died of cancer, said Martin Fredmann, her former husband and the artistic director of the Colorado Ballet in Denver.         Ms. Fedicheva belonged to the generation of Kirov stars, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Yuri Soloviev and Alla Sizova, who created a sensation in the West in the 1960's. After graduating from the Kirov school in 1955, Ms. Fedicheva excelled in 19th-century classics that showed off her dynamism, like "Raymonda," and she drew immediate acclaim during the Kirov's first seasons in New York in 1961 and 1964. Unlike her younger partner Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mr. Nureyev and Ms. Makarova, Ms. Fedicheva did not defect while touring abroad.         But after she married Mr. Fredmann, an American dancer studying at the Kirov, in 1974, Soviet authorities, saying she was not divorced from her first husband, blocked her exit visa to the United States for a year. Her case received international attention after she was beaten by two men outside her apartment in what was then Leningrad, in what she said was an attempt to intimidate her. The Soviet Government permitted her to leave in February 1975 with her son, Ivan.         Ms. Fedicheva and Mr. Fredmann were divorced four years later but remained good friends, and she staged an acclaimed production of "Giselle" for the Colorado Ballet last year.         Ms. Fedicheva staged other works from the Russian repertory and choreographed new ones in the United States and abroad after she opened the New Russian School in Sea Cliff, L.I., after her arrival. She also directed her students and professional guest artists in the Fedicheva Ballet Company of Glen Cove, which was founded in 1982. The group's annual production of "The Nutcracker" was seen in New York City and on Long Island.         As a dancer, Ms. Fedicheva was at her best when her technical brilliance came to the fore in ballets like "Laurencia" and "Don Quixote." Yet she also excelled in "La Bayadere" and performed regularly in classics like "Swan Lake" and in contemporary Soviet ballets.         In addition to her son, Ms. Fedicheva is survived by her mother in St. Petersburg, Russia.       
         Gertrude Russek Nemerov, whose family founded and ran the Russeks Fifth Avenue department store in Manhattan and whose children won fame in the world of arts and letters, died on Tuesday in Albuquerque, N.M. She was 93.         Mrs. Nemerov's son, the poet Howard Nemerov, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1978 and served as Poet Laureate of the United States from 1988 to 1990. He died in 1991. One of her daughters was the photographer Diane Arbus, who died in 1971.         She is survived by another daughter, Renee Nemerov Sparkia of Albuquerque, six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Helene Thurman Martin Heinemann, a retired geriatric social worker, died on Thursday at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 88 and lived in New Canaan and Washington, Conn., before moving to Crosslands in 1977.         Her death followed a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Heinemann, a native of Harrisburg, Pa., graduated from Wellesley College and the New York School of Social Work.         She is survived by a son, H. Erich Heinemann of Great Neck, L.I., chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, investment bankers; a daughter, Marianne Russo of Oxford, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.; a brother, Frederick Martin of Orono, Me.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandson.         Her husband, Hans Heinemann, an investment banker, died in 1967.       
         Lina Basquette, a star of the silent-film era who later became a professional dog breeder and handler, died on Friday at her home in Wheeling, W.Va. She was 87.         The cause was cancer, said Barry Paris, a friend.         At the height of her career, Ms. Basquette was known as much for the intrigues and dramas of her personal life as for those in which she starred on the screen. Newspapers in the 1920's and 30's carried stories of her marriages (nine in all, to seven different husbands) and divorces, as well as her affairs with the rich and famous (including Jack Dempsey, Nelson Eddy and the Metropolitan Opera baritone Lawrence Tibbett) and a rape case that ended in the conviction of an Army private.         Ms. Basquette (originally Baskette) was born in San Mateo, Calif. She was signed at the age of 9 by Universal to make a series of silent films called "Lena Baskette Featurettes." Later, she was a star dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies. Among her many film credits were "Serenade" (1927), "Rose of the Rio Grande" (1938) and "A Night for Crime" (1942). Her best-known role was as the lead in "The Godless Girl," Cecil B. DeMille's last silent movie, made in 1929.         In 1925, she was married for the first time, to Sam Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers. Their daughter, Lita, was born a year later. After his death, in 1927, a legal battle over the estate and the custody of their daughter ensued, leading to a series of much-publicized suicide attempts by Ms. Basquette.         She was an avid dog lover: from 1947 to 1974, she ran Honey Hollow Kennels in Bucks County, Pa. She became one of the best-known breeders and handlers of champion Great Danes in American dog-show history, and also wrote several books on dog breeding.         Ms. Basquette is survived by her daughter, Lita Warner Heller; a son, Edward Alvin Hayes; a half-sister, the actress and dancer Marge Champion, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Kathleen L. Schwaninger, an advocate for the disabled who played a critical role in the decade-long effort to close down the Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded on Staten Island and who went on to help found an agency to aid seriously ill children, died Sunday in a plane crash in Hyannis, Mass. She was 50 and lived in Brooklyn and East Falmouth, Mass.         Ms. Schwaninger became executive director of the Willowbrook Review Panel in 1978, three years after it was created under a Federal court order to monitor the release of residents of Willowbrook into community settings. Willowbrook was then the state's largest treatment center for the mentally retarded, and the panel was criticized for its oversight of the process, which included placing residents in smaller institutions within the community. The seven-member panel was dissolved in 1980 after Albany cut off its financing.         In 1981, she became deputy director of the Massachusetts Commission of Retardation, working to remove the retarded from institutions. From 1982 to 1987, she headed the nonprofit agency Working Organization for Retarded Citizens in Queens, which put handicapped people in group homes.         She left the agency to join SKIP, Sick Kids Need Involved People, of New York, which she helped to found. She was its chief executive director for the last six years. The agency advises more than 2,000 clients on equipment, services and benefits for people with developmental disabilities.         Born in Omaha, she received her undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Nebraska. She was involved in mental health work in Nebraska and was a former executive director of the state Office of Mental Retardation.         She is survived by a son, Jason M. Anderson of Boca Raton, Fla.; a daughter, Amy J. Anderson of East Falmouth; a stepdaughter, Sherri O'Grady of Boston; a sister, Pat Hodges of Ashland, Neb., and three grandchildren.       
         Pearl Primus, a pioneering dancer, choreographer and teacher whose anthropological work exposed Americans to the realities of black life in America and to the richness of African and Caribbean dance, died on Saturday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 74.         Miss Primus died after a brief illness, said Joyce Knight, a friend.         A powerful performer and lecturer, Miss Primus played a role similar to that of Katherine Dunham in establishing dance by and about blacks as an important part of American culture. Her belief that there was material for dance in the everyday lives of black people -- and her strong personality and early success -- had a profound influence on several generations of black choreographers and dancers, among them Donald McKayle and Alvin Ailey.         Miss Primus visited Africa for the first time in 1948, but she had begun to present carefully researched dance with African themes in 1943 and was the first American choreographer to do so. In 1974, her contributions were celebrated in a salute to her and the ballerina Janet Collins by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         But Miss Primus was equally celebrated for her depiction of American life and of the injustices inflicted on black Americans, particularly in the American South. In one of her best-known dances, "Strange Fruit," a woman reacts in horror to a lynching. "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" -- created, like "Strange Fruit," in 1943 and inspired by the Langston Hughes poem -- depicted the Mississippi and the hard lives of blacks along its shores. "Dance has been my freedom and my world," she said in 1991. "I dance not to entertain but to help people better understand each other."         An accident of fate led Miss Primus to become a dancer. Born in Trinidad, she was brought to the United States as a child by her parents. She received a bachelor's degree in biology and pre-medical sciences from Hunter College with the intention of becoming a doctor. Unable to find a laboratory job open to blacks, she applied to the National Youth Administration and was put into a dance group.         She enrolled in modern-dance classes at the New Dance Group, where she began to teach, and in 1943 gave the first performance of her own work. John Martin wrote in The New York Times that "if ever a young dancer was entitled to a company of her own and the freedom to do what she chooses with it, she is it."         A few months later, Barney Josephson invited Miss Primus to perform at his Cafe Society Downtown. Troubled by having to choose between medicine and dance, she consulted Mr. Martin. No one would ever be able to say, he told her, whether art or medicine had the greater curative power. Miss Primus remained at the nightclub for 10 months. When there was a problem with the music during her first performance there, a burly man rose from the audience and encouraged her to keep on, teasing her about having broken up his home by teaching his son the Lindy Hop. The man was Paul Robeson, one of many black cultural figures with whom Miss Primus would become friendly over the years.         Miss Primus toured with the musical "Show Boat," then founded a company and presented her work on Broadway and in national tours. On one Southern tour, she was offered a Rosenwald Foundation scholarship to study dance in Africa. Later, she worked there with local performers. She married Percival Borde, a dancer she met on a visit home to Trinidad in 1953, and they founded a popular school in New York and performed frequently together. Mr. Borde died in 1979.         Miss Primus was made director of a new performing-arts center in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1959. Two years later, she and Mr. Borde performed throughout Africa with their dancers and musicians on a tour sponsored by the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. It was not until 1978 that she completed her work for a doctorate in anthropology at New York University.         "My life has been like traveling up a river," she told an interviewer in 1979. "Every now and then I would hear singing around the bend, and so around the bend I would go and become occupied with living."         Miss Primus continued to perform until 1980, after which she was the director of the Cora P. Maloney College, a black studies school at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and was Five-College Professor of Ethnic Studies at schools in Massachusetts in the 1980's. She was an early and important participant in "The Black Tradition in American Dance," a program to revive and preserve black dance that began in 1988 at the American Dance Festival, where in 1991 she was named the first recipient of the Balasaraswati/ Joy AnnDewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching. Other honors included the National Medal of the Arts in 1991. Miss Primus continued to teach throughout the United States until her death.         She is survived by a son, Onwin Borde of Miami.       
         Shirley Chernela, a former administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in Manhattan and the first woman to be president of the National Association of Temple Administrators, died Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Janet Chernela Mount, her daughter.         Ms. Chernela became the administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in 1972 and held the job for 20 years. She was president of the national administrators' group from 1982 to 1985. In 1991, she was elected an honorary trustee.         She was the first woman to be certified a Fellow in Temple Administration in a program set up by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the National Association of Temple Administrators.         In the early 1950's, her family joined with three others to found a congregation, Temple Emanuel in Great Neck, L.I., of which she served as administrator. She then became director of personnel and building services at the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, where she remained until joining Temple Shaaray Tefila.         In addition to Ms. Chernela Mount, she is survived by another daughter, Susan Chernilo, and a son, Abbey Chernela, both of New York; a sister, Diane Graf of Southbury, Conn., and a brother, Paul Moss of Hewlett, L.I.       
         Ruth Blumka, a prominent New York dealer in medieval and Renaissance art and a donor of artworks to museums around the country, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her son, Anthony Blumka.         Among the works donated to the Metropolitan Museum by Mrs. Blumka and her husband, Leopold, were a 15th-century silver tabernacle produced for the Monastery of St. Peter at Salzburg and a rare enameled devotional cradle made in the Netherlands in the 15th century.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Blumka donated other objects, including, in 1991, a German 15th-century tapestry from the altar of a Nuremberg church.         "It's a great loss," Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said yesterday. "Ruth Blumka was really an art dealer of the old school with a tremendous knowledge of the works of art she handled and an extremely good eye. And she placed a number of great objects, both through sale and gift in the Metropolitan Museum and elsewhere."         The Blumkas also made gifts of art objects and antiques to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Gallery in Washington, the Minneapolis Museum of Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Louvre in Paris. She was a member of the National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America and a participant in the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show each year since its founding in 1989.         Mrs. Blumka, whose name was originally Ruth Zickel, was born and reared in Munich, the daughter of Nadja and Frederic Zickel, dealers in German Expressionist art. She came to New York in 1939, and in 1942 began to work for Mr. Blumka at his East 57th Street gallery.         Mr. Blumka introduced her to medieval and Renaissance art, the field in which his family had specialized in Vienna for several generations. She remained at the gallery after their marriage a decade later. The gallery is now at 101 East 81st Street.         The Blumkas counted among their clients Robert Lehman, Belle and Jack Linsky, Marjorie Merriweather Post and Anne Johnson when she was the wife of Henry Ford 2d.         In addition to her son, a New York art dealer, she is survived by three grandchildren, Kimberly and Justin Nasatir and Amanda Goldberg, and a brother, John Zickel of Carmichael, Calif.       
         Nora Jaffe, a painter and sculptor, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Lee.         A recurring theme in Mrs. Jaffe's work was the male nude, the subject of her first oil painting, when she was 12. Largely self-taught (although she studied briefly with Samuel Adler and David Hare), she began showing her art in 1960. Since then, she had been in group and solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum and galleries. Her last show was at the Virginia Lust Gallery in 1990.         She did the covers for books by the poets Adrienne Rich and Clayton Eshelman.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Joseph, and a son, Kenneth A., all of New York City, and three brothers, Jeff Miller and Jack Miller of Delphos, Ohio, and Tom Miller of Arlington, Va.       
         Katherine Elliott, an advocate for simpler and more practical methods of health care for poor people, died on Saturday at the Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth in London, where she lived. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Veronica Elliott of Washington, said.         Dr. Elliott was among those professionals in an emerging medical field in the 1950's and 60's who stressed that the technology used to meet the health care needs of any population must be appropriate to their own resources and skills.         Recognizing that diarrhea was the greatest killer of children in poor countries, for example, she aided in the development of a simple oral rehydration therapy consisting of a foiled-packet containing a powder that could be mixed with water to provide nutrients the sick child needed to survive.         In an effort to make childbirth safer, she helped to develop kits for midwives with a clean plastic sheet, cotton, soap and an antiseptic razor to cut the umblilical cord.         Dr. Elliott, whose work took her to Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Iran, also advocated greater reliance on trained medical workers to see to the health needs of people in remote areas.         She received a medical degree from the University of London's School of Medicine for Women and after World War II she joined the National Health Service. She was an assistant director at the Ciba Foundation from 1966 to 1981.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a second daughter, Rose, and a son, Tony, both of London, and six grandchildren.       
         Charlotte N. Montgomery, a pioneering consumer writer, died on Nov. 10 in Amherst Nursing Home in Amherst, Mass., where she had lived since April. She was 90 and had lived in Westfield, N.J., for most of her life.         She died of pneumonia, said her daughter, Sarah Montgomery of South Hadley, Mass.         A journalist whose career began as the country's production was shifting into new technologies and goods after World War II, she wrote about consumers' needs as well as manufacturers' responsibilities. A column she wrote, "Speaker for the House," appeared in Good Housekeeping magazine from 1955 to 1982.         She graduated from Vassar in 1927.         She is also survived by a son, Harry, of Belchertown, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Viola Spolin, who as a teacher and author was an inspiration for the improvisational theater movement, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Her sister, Beatrice Lees, said Mrs. Spolin had three strokes in recent years.         Through her theater games and her book "Improvisations for the Theater" as well as the subsequent work of her son Paul Sills at the Compass and Second City in Chicago and with Story Theater, Mrs. Spolin influenced several generations of actors and directors, including Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Severn Darden, Barbara Harris, Anthony Holland, Paul Sand and Avery Schreiber. Although she did not have a career as a professional director, her guidance as a vital and highly demonstrative teacher was to indispensable as actors increasingly responded to the idea of improv.         Various comic techniques came later, but she was a primary source of the practical mechanics of theater games, exercises designed to free actors. Explaining her approach, she once said, "My vision is a world of accessible intuition." Mr. Sills said his mother wanted "to help players hit their intuition" and become more spontaneous.         Most of Mrs. Spolin's theater work was with children. She was born in Chicago, where she trained with Neva Boyd, an educator who used games to help children adjust to life in the city. Mrs. Spolin added the idea of theater games, exercises that led to role-playing. Later she worked for the W.P.A. When Mr. Sills joined David Shepherd in creating the Compass improvisational theater, his mother's games became part of the work process.         Since 1945 Mrs. Spolin had lived in Los Angeles, where she founded the Young Actors Company, which is both a school and theater. She retired in 1980. "Improvisations for the Theater," her best-known book (published by Northwestern University Press) remains a standard theatrical text.         In addition to her sister, of New York City, and her son Paul, of Baileys Harbor, Wis., she is survived by her third husband, Robert Kolmus Greene; another son, William Sills of Oakland, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Joanne Rathgeb, an actress, director and educator who fought for greater awareness and increased resources to fight breast cancer, died of the disease on Nov. 19 at her home in Essex Junction, Vt. She was 64.         Her cancer was diagnosed nine years ago, but she continued an active life. She retired last year as a professor of fine arts and drama at St. Michael's College in Colchester after 30 years on the faculty. She was the first woman to head the fine arts department there.         Vermont has the eighth highest rate of death from breast cancer in the nation, but Mrs. Rathgeb's prominence as a campaigner against the disease extended beyond her home state. She collected about 14,000 letters that were delivered to the Congressional delegation from Vermont. The letters called for increased research and a cancer registry.         In 1992, she started a cancer registry in Vermont, and Congress passed the Cancer Registries Act, which established a national standard for the collection of cancer data.         Mrs. Rathgeb was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and earned a bachelor's degree in theater and a master's degree in English at Indiana State University. She did post-graduate work at Catholic University of America, taught in the Chicago public schools and helped to organize theaters in Terre Haute.         Early in her career, she joined National Players and took part in productions of "The Taming of the Shrew," "Twelfth Night" and "Oedipus Rex" in Europe and in this country, including a performance at the Carnegie Hall Playhouse in Manhattan. She later returned to New York to appear in Phoenix Theater productions of "Peer Gynt" and "Lysistrata."         Since 1958, she had been a producer, director, coach and actress at St. Michael's Playhouse in Vermont.         Mrs. Rathgeb is survived by her husband of 34 years, Donald Sr.; three daughters, Elizabeth Pratt of Amesbury, Mass., and Laura Rathgeb and Mary Jo Balaskas, both of Manhattan; a son, Donald Jr. of Burlington, Vt.; a sister, Laura Mae Hellrung of Alton, Ill.; a brother, Howard Ellspermann of Cape Coral, Fla., and one granddaughter.       
         Elenore Hangley, a former executive vice president of the Advertising Council, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, in Englewood, N.J. She was 63 and lived in Cliffside, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Charles.         Mrs. Hangley spent her 30-year career with the Advertising Council, which is responsible for the nation's public service advertising campaigns. At the council, she developed and managed advertising campaigns like the one involving McGruff, the dog who promoted anti-crime activities. She was also responsible for the council's overall operations.         Mrs. Hangley, a native of Union City, N.J., and a graduate of Hunter College, began work at the Advertising Council in 1951. In 1965, she left her position as a radio and television services manager to rear her son. She returned as an advertising campaign manager 12 years later and in 1980 was named director of campaign administration.         In 1982, she was appointed vice president of the council. Seven years later, she was named senior vice president of campaign administration and then, in the same year, was named executive vice president of operations. In 1993, she retired.         At the time of her death, she was the president of the board of directors of Child Find America, which tries to find runaways and missing children, and a member of the steering committee of the National Crime Prevention Council, for which the McGruff anti-crime advertisements were designed.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Charles, of Cliffside, N.J., and her sister, Norma Kramer of New York City.       
         Elinor F. Poindexter, a Manhattan dealer in contemporary art, died on Sunday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 88.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son, Joseph.         Before she became a dealer, Mrs. Poindexter collected the works of both abstract and figurative painters with her husband, George, a commodities broker. He died in 1975.         She founded the Poindexter Gallery in 1955 and showed the works of New York and California artists like Richard Diebenkorn, Al Held, Jules Olitski, Nell Blaine and Robert De Niro. The gallery closed in 1978.         Mrs. Poindexter, originally Elinor Fuller, was born in Montreal, but grew up on Staten Island. She was graduated from Finch College in Manhattan.         Earlier this year, she donated 36 acres in Easton to the Aspetuck Land Trust, the largest such gift ever to the Fairfield County Land Conservancy.         In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie of Cincinnati and Christie Dennis of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Leslie Randall of Newton, Conn., and eight grandchildren.       
         Carmen McRae, the jazz singer known for her probing interpretations of lyrics and her bruised but unbowed point of view, died on Thursday evening at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         She had fallen into a semi-coma four days earlier, a month after being hospitalized for a stroke, said her secretary, Jan March. She withdrew from public performance in May 1991 after an episode of respiratory failure only hours after she completed an engagement at the Blue Note jazz club in New York.         Although Ms. McRae never reached the heights of popularity attained by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday, she was widely regarded as their artistic equal. In a prolific recording career that spanned nearly five decades, she had only two minor hits, both in the mid-1950's. But the scores of songs on she which stamped her bittersweet, gently mocking signature included "Alfie," "The Music That Makes Me Dance," "Guess Who I Saw Today?," "Blame It on My Youth," "Yesterdays" and "Mean to Me." In January, she received a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Fellowship award for lifetime achievement.         Ms. McRae was born in Harlem on April 8, 1920, one of four children of immigrants from the West Indies. Growing up in Brooklyn, she attended Julia Richman High School in Manhattan and received her musical grounding in five years of formal piano lessons.         Like many other jazz giants of her generation, she had her first break when she won an amateur talent contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It was there that she was discovered in 1939 by Irene Kitchings, who was then married to the jazz pianist Teddy Wilson. Through Wilson, who worked with Billie Holiday, Ms. McRae met the woman who became her biggest influence and who recorded Ms. McRae's song "Dream of Life."         "If Billie Holiday had never existed," Ms. McRae later recalled, "I probably wouldn't have, either."         Ms. McRae's parents, who opposed a show-business career, persuaded their daughter to take a secretarial course, and she spent two years in Washington doing clerical work for the Government. Returning to Brooklyn in 1943, she did office work by day while performing in clubs at night. Gradually music took over, and she began substituting for other singers in bands led by Benny Carter, Count Basie and Earl (Fatha) Hines. She eventually landed an 18-month engagement with a band led by Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, and in 1946 she made her recording debut with the band, singing under the name Carmen Clarke.         In Chicago, when the Ellington band broke up, Ms. McRae remained there and embarked on a solo career. A two-week engagement in a club as a singing pianist expanded to 17 weeks, and she ended up staying in Chicago three and a half years.         Her career took off when she returned to New York and developed an act as a stand-up singer at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, receiving enough notice to be named best new female singer by Down Beatmagazine.         Ms. McRae released her first solo album for Bethlehem in 1955, the same year she made her first recordings for Decca, where she remained until 1958. From there she moved to Kapp (1958-60) and Columbia (1960-62), then jumped to several smaller labels before ending up on Atlantic for five years (1967-71). Her longest record company affiliation was with Concord Jazz (1980-88). Her last two albums, for RCA, were tributes to Thelonious Monk and Sarah Vaughan.         In these four decades as a jazz star, Ms. McRae toured constantly. Although she left New York for Southern California in the late 1960's, she appeared in New York regularly, usually at the Blue Note, where she did two engagements a year through most of the 1980's.         From the moment she made her mark, Ms. McRae was recognized as a supremely insightful interpreter of lyrics.         "Every word is very important to me," she said. "Lyrics come first, then the melody. The lyric of a song I might decide to sing must have something that I can convince you with. It's like an actress who selects a role that contains something she wants to portray."         The singer's two marriages, to the be-bop drummer Kenny Clarke and the pianist Ike Isaacs, both ended in divorce. There was no immediate word on survivors.       
         Jeanne Sumner Newman, a public health specialist who worked to improve medical services in developing countries, died on Oct. 24 at West Virginia University Hospitals in Morgantown, W.Va. She was 65 and lived in Baltimore.         She died from injuries suffered in a car accident on Oct. 7, said her daughter Katharine Newman Zohir. Dr. Newman had been traveling to an American Friends Service Committee Retreat in Charleston, W.Va., with her husband, John Brown Newman, who was also injured.         As a consultant to the United States Agency for International Development, she evaluated health care in rural clinics and recommended revisions in supervision and training. In her work, she expanded the role of nursing technicians, who often were the only health workers in isolated places.         She is also survived by another daughter, Pixie A. B. Newman of Chicago, a son, Jon of Glen Rock, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Mildred Hilson, a grande dame of New York's charity circuit who entertained royalty and heads of state in her suite at the Waldorf Towers, died yesterday morning at home. She was 96.         She had been in poor health for five years, her granddaughter, Wendy Levey, said.         Even in her later years, Mrs. Hilson possessed a certain mischievous charm. "She lived on chocolate-covered marshmallows," Mrs. Levey said. "She had them hidden all over the house. The only ones who knew where they were were she and my 5-year-old daughter, Mariel."         Mrs. Hilson was the widow of Edwin I. Hilson, an investment banker, who died in 1952. She took his seat on the board of the Hospital for Special Surgery after his death, and five years later was named vice president, a title she held until her death.         As perennial chairwoman of the hospital's annual benefit, Mrs. Hilson raised more than $15 million. The plaza of a new hospital residence was dedicated to her in 1989. That year another of her charities, the New York City division of the American Cancer Society, gave her its humanitarian award. She also received the Sarnoff Award for volunteer service from the women's division of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.         An effective fund-raiser for the Republican Party, Mrs. Hilson lent her name to a series of citizens' committees to elect or re-elect Republican candidates to state and national office.         She was a patron of the arts, serving on the board of the Museum of the City of New York and on the New York City Cultural Council. In the late 1960's she was Mayor John V. Lindsay's unsalaried representative on cultural affairs.         "Don't make me sound all good-workish," she once told an interviewer. "I really so enjoy life. I adore to entertain."         The guest lists for her parties were dazzling. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor were among those who dined in her scarlet drawing room, as were the actor Laurence Olivier, numerous United Nations ambassadors and several American presidents.         President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, who occupied a Towers suite when he was chief United States delegate to the United Nations, returned to visit their friend and neighbor after moving to the White House.         President Dwight D. Eisenhower painted a portrait of Mrs. Hilson that hangs in her study. And in 1988, former President Richard M. Nixon played "Happy Birthday" on the piano at her 90th-birthday gala at the St. Regis while 200 guests sang along.         Mrs. Hilson maintained her interest in politics throughout her life. "Only a year ago, when Mayor Giuliani and his wife, Donna, were dining at my apartment," Mrs. Levey said, "she called and asked to speak to the Mayor and gave him half an hour of her advice on running the city."         A stately, elegant woman almost 6 feet tall, Mrs. Hilson was dressed by several of the great couturiers. In 1989, although bedridden, she was still able to have a preview of the spring collection, when Hubert de Givenchy took one of his models to her apartment for a private showing.  Mrs. Hilson's daughter, Mary Wolf, died in 1987, and her son, John S., in 1991. She is survived, in addition to Mrs. Levey, by four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Mildred Orrick, a designer who gave women's fashion a natural, informal look for more than three decades, died on Dec. 9 at her home in Elliston, Va., where she had lived for the last 20 years. She was 88.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Sarah Orrick of Washington.         With the emergence of American designers as a dominant influence in the 1940's, Mrs. Orrick was one of the new generation of designers who were leading fashion toward sensible clothes at a time when the market was quickly growing.         Her earliest best-known designs, which were produced for Janice Milan Inc. in the late 1940's, represented her view of a look that was feminine but simple. But there had been a practicality and an originality to her work almost from the start.         As a costume designer in the early 40's, she put dancers' leotards in her sketches for Harper's Bazaar as a style that was suitable for wearing off the rehearsal floor. Quickly, they became part of the day's outfits.         By the 1950's, her designs were a regular part of New York fashion shows. At the same time, she was offering outfits that could be sewn at home.         In 1958, she continued her work under the label of Claire McCardell, a designer and friend of Mrs. Orrick who had died the year before. In 1963, she became a designer for Villager Clothes, a highly successful line that operated out of Philadelphia.         She retired in the mid-1970's.         Mrs. Orrick studied at the Parsons School of Design in New York and Paris. She started as a costume designer and worked for Natasha Rambova.         She also worked for Norman Bel Geddes, the stage and industrial designer, designing costumes for productions of "Lysistrata" and "Hamlet" in the 1920's and 1930's.         Her husband of 62 years, Jesse Lewis Orrick, died in 1992. She is also survived by a daughter, Martha Orrick of Colorado Springs, Colo.; a son, Nicholas, of Andover, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Anita Zahn, a longtime teacher of the technique and dances of Isadora Duncan and her sister Elizabeth Duncan, died on Nov. 3 at her home in Grants Pass, Ore. She was 91.         The Daily Courier in Grants Pass announced her death. It said Miss Zahn had moved to Oregon in 1986 from New York City, where she had begun teaching at the Isadora Duncan School of Dance in 1924.         Ms. Zahn's legacy to her American pupils was somewhat different from that handed down by Isadora Duncan's adopted daughters, known as the Isadorables. Unlike them, Ms. Zahn was a direct disciple of Elizabeth Duncan, who directed her sister's school in Grunewald, Germany, before World War I. In 1911, Elizabeth opened her own school in Darmstadt. Ms. Zahn, who was born in Baden-Baden, studied there and later followed Elizabeth to the United States.         She is survived by a son, Eddie Bauman; two granddaughters, and a great-granddaughter, all of Grants Pass.       
         Frances T. Freeman Jalet-Cruz, a legal-aid lawyer who fought for more humane conditions in the Texas prison system, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Manor in Trumbull, Conn. She was 84.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jalet (pronounced ja-LAY) was trained in international law but spent much of her career defending prisoners and the indigent. In Texas, newspapers came to label her "St. Frances of Houston" and "Portia of the Poor."         She arrived in the state in 1967 fresh from a course in poverty law at the University of Pennsylvania -- 57 years old and a white-haired mother of five grown children. Supported by a fellowship, she joined the Legal Aid and Defender Society of Travis County in Austin to defend the poor.         A newspaper article about her prompted a Mexican-American inmate and jailhouse lawyer named Fred Arispe Cruz to call her for assistance in appealing his robbery conviction. Hearing of inmates' complaints about what she considered harsh and often illegal treatment from the Texas Department of Corrections, she mounted a campaign on behalf of the prisoners.         She was in the thick of a stormy debate and bitter, costly litigation in the state's prison system in the 1960's and 1970's. She also caused a sensation in 1972 when, at the age of 61, she married Mr. Cruz, 32, after his release from prison. The marriage lasted six years.         The attention eventually led to a broader movement focusing on prison reform, and in the 1980's the Federal courts ordered sweeping changes in prisons statewide.         Her exploits and battle were chronicled in "Texas Prisons: The Walls Came Tumbling Down," by Steve J. Martin and Sheldon Ekland-Olson (Texas Monthly Press, 1987). The book's dedication cited "her unwavering belief in the rule of law."         She was born in Boston and graduated from Radcliffe College before earning advanced degrees at Columbia University Law School, Teachers College and Georgetown Law Center. She worked for the American Association of University Women and in various legal positions in Washington before moving to Texas.         Mrs. Jalet is survived by a son, Tuckerman S.

         Frances Prince Schuman, the founding chairwoman of the National Friends of Public Broadcasting and the wife of the composer William Schuman, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         She died after a brief illness, said her son, Anthony.         Mrs. Schuman was the founder and first chairwoman of the Friends of Thirteen and the National Friends of Public Broadcasting, and served for many years on the board of WNET Channel 13. With the director John Houseman she guided the development of the Acting Company, a theater group of drama graduates that her husband established when he was the president of the Juilliard School.         Mrs. Schuman, known as Frankie, was born in New York City in 1913 and graduated from Barnard College. Her early career was in social services, with a focus on people with disabilities. She was a staff member of the New York State Employment Service and a director of the Vocational Advisory Service. She was a founding director of the Cerebral Palsy Association and the Urban League of Westchester County, and at the time of her death was on the boards of the MacDowell Colony and the American Composers Orchestra.         In addition to her son, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Andrea, of Newton Highlands, Mass., and a grandson, Joshua Weiss.       
         Rose Wells Bing, a fashion consultant who was instrumental in bringing the ideas and trends of Europe to American consumers, died on Wednesday in Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her grandson, Jonathan Bing of Manhattan.         Known for an eye as sharp as her opinions, she was a front-row observer to the major fashion shows in Europe as well as in Manhattan, watching for trends that major retailers could adapt into affordable clothes.         At her death, she was a consultant for the Gap, noted for her regular patrols of its outlets to check on merchandising operations. Until the day before she died, she was reporting to work early in the morning.         She began her career at Ohrbach's, helping to incorporate European designs into the store's high-volume clothing lines. In 1959, she was elected the store's vice president, the first woman to hold that position at Ohrbach's.         She broke another barrier in 1965, when she became the first woman to be named vice president at Federated Department Stores. At Federated, she was an adviser on trends and new ideas in the industry. She joined the Gap in 1974.         Besides her grandson, she is survived by a son, Richard, of Manhattan, and three brothers, Jack Wells of Beverly Hills, Calif., Louis of San Mateo, Calif., and Irving of Long Island.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.
