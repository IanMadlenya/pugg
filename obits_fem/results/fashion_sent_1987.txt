Known for her irreverence and for fascination with society, Mrs. Dorsey frequently combined fashion and social reporting, and was in fact a member of the international social set herself.
A witty and somewhat acerbic commentator, Mrs. Dorsey was a force in fashion circles in New York and Tokyo as well as Paris.
''She had the courage to report fashion critically,'' said Bill Blass, the designer, who remembered meeting her soon after World War II in Paris with Art Buchwald and other Tribune contributors.
''She liked the social aspects of fashion and she drew the connection between the two worlds,'' he added.

        ''I think of her as the girl from Tunis who was so involved with her family,'' Mr. Lacroix said, ''not of the dragon-like editor who was so intimidating at the fashion shows.
''Hebe revolutionized fashion writing,'' said John Fairchild, chairman of Fairchild Publications.
''She invented the idea of reviewing fashion like a play and she always did it with a razor, not a knife.
'' Streak of Irreverence
        Her irreverence is illustrated by the article she wrote a few years ago after being bannned from a Christian Dior fashion show for an unfavorable review of the house's previous collection.
''She helped put fashion in the public eye,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times and co-chairman of The Herald Tribune.

'' Expanded Coverage
        As editor of women's and family/ style news from 1965 to 1974, Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received.
Joined The Times in 1961
        In 1961, she was hired by The New York Times as a fashion reporter.
She held a variety of posts besides literary editor, including society editor, fashion editor and crime reporter.
