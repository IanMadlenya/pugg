She graduated from Kings County Hospital Center School of Nursing and Boston College and earned a master's degree and a doctorate at Columbia University.         At her retirement she was the associate chief for research in the nursing service at the hospital and an assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco. She also worked in family therapy at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto.         Her first marriage, to William Chenitz, ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, Ray Manley; two daughters, Rebecca Chenitz of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Kim Manley of Greenbrae; a sister, Lucille Allison of Greenbrae, and her mother, Yvette Allison of Summerfield, Fla.       
         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.         Then she returned to the university's law school, becoming its third female graduate. She worked in her father's firm, then married Reuben Oscar Everett and worked with him. Later she was a partner in the firm of Everett and Hancock. Her practice was mostly probate, real estate and family law.         She served 20 years on the Durham City Council after being elected in nonpartisan balloting. She was active in the real estate business and was a founder of WRDC-TV in Raleigh, N.C. She was also an elder in the First Presbyterian Church.         Surviving are her son, Robinson O. Everett of Durham, retired chief judge of the United States Court of Military Appeals, and three grandsons.       
         Shirley Berman, whose daughter, born with Down Syndrome, inspired her to wage a battle for a New Jersey law requiring doctors to inform parents if their unborn child is retarded, died on Feb. 8 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 55 years old and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Berman, a social worker, began a legal battle after her daughter Sharon, now 17, was born with Down Syndrome. Mrs. Berman contended that her doctor failed to tell her she risked having a retarded child and that the fetus could have been tested for the condition.         In 1979, the New Jersey State Supreme Court ruled that doctors could be sued for "wrongful birth" if their negligence deprived a mother of her right to an abortion and a child was born with defects.         Mrs. Berman worked for the Westchester Association for Retarded Children. A native of Montreal, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree from McGill University in Canada, a master's in art therapy in 1981 from the College of New Rochelle and a master's in social work from Fordham University in 1988.         She is survived by her husband, Paul; two daughters, Sharon, at home, and Deborah, of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Jonathan, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Minnie Segal of Montreal, and two brothers, Bernard and Henry Segal, both of Montreal.       
         Angela Carter, a novelist and short-story writer, died at her home in London on Sunday. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for Farrar, Straus & Giroux, her publisher in New York.         Ms. Carter's work was widely praised in Britain, although less widely known in the United States. She was the author of more than a half-dozen macabre novels and a polemical study of the Marquis de Sade, "The Sadeian Woman."         Her novels included "The Magic Toyshop," "Several Perceptions" and "Nights of the Circus." A number of her works were regarded as fairy tales with modern morals. Wrote for Radio and Films         British critics often described Ms. Carter's writing style as "magic realism," but she believed the label was not quite accurate. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, she said: "It's more realism than not. I can't define it until after it's done except that it is definitely fiction. It's more in the genre of Latin American writers like Garcia Marquez and Borges."         Whatever the label, Ms. Carter's interest in fantasies, fairy tales and dreams was lifelong. She wrote radio scripts, short stories, children's books and screenplays, one of which became the 1984 film "The Company of Wolves." Her 1991 novel, "Wise Children," was about the illegitimate twin daughters of a celebrated Shakespearean actor.         Ms. Carter was born in 1940 in Eastbourne. She began her writing career as a journalist on a South London weekly, The Croydon Advertiser. Later, she studied English literature at the University of Bristol, then began to write cultural criticism for New Society, The New Statesman and other publications.         From 1976 to 1978, Ms. Carter was a fellow in creative writing at Sheffield University in England, and in 1980 and 1981 she was a visiting professor in the writing program at Brown University in Providence, R.I. She also taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.         She is survived by her husband, Mark Pearce, and a son, Alexander.       
         Jean R. Yawkey, the majority owner of the Red Sox, a fixture at Fenway Park for almost half a century and a major Boston philanthropist, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, six days after suffering a severe stoke. She was 83 years old.         Despite reports that she had been in failing health last year, Mrs. Yawkey had continued to attend Red Sox home games.         In addition to her active role with the Red Sox and her extensive charitable work, Mrs. Yawkey had been a director of the National Baseball Museum and Hall of Fame since 1984, when she became the first, and so far only woman elected to the board.         As the widow of Thomas A. Yawkey, the multimillionaire sportsman who bought the Red Sox for $1 million in 1933 and lost an estimated $10 million trying to build championship teams over the next 44 seasons, Mrs. Yawkey saw it as her duty to live up to his free-spending ways after his death in 1976.         For a while, however, it appeared that the team would fall into other, less generous, hands. In 1978, the Yawkey estate was on the verge of selling the team to a syndicate formed by Haywood C. Sullivan, a Red Sox executive, and the team's former trainer, Edward G. (Buddy) LeRoux Jr., with Mrs. Yawkey as a limited partner.         But the deal was so heavily leveraged that it failed to win the approval of the baseball commissioner until Mrs. Yawkey, who put up the Fenway real estate as part of her stake, agreed to join the group as the third general partner. At the time of the transaction, the club was valued at $20 million.         The arrangement proved stormy almost from the start, with Mr. LeRoux pressing for measures that would earn profits for the partnership and Mrs. Yawkey just as determined to continue operating the team in the grand Yawkey tradition. Mr. Sullivan for the most part sided with Mrs. Yawkey, and Mr. LeRoux was increasingly isolated.         By 1987, Mrs. Yawkey held a two-thirds interest to Mr. Sullivan's one-third share, and she was very much in charge from then on, relegating Mr. Sullivan to little more than a figurehead. Denied the Ultimate Goal         Although Mrs. Yawkey's business adviser and presumptive heir, John Harrington, the president of the JRY Corporation, which holds the Yawkey Red Sox shares, was often mistaken for the real power behind the franchise, those close to the club insisted that Mr. Harrington was merely the prime minister and Mrs. Yawkey was always the queen.         Like her husband, who saw his team win three pennants but never a World Series championship, Mrs. Yawkey, too, was denied the ultimate goal. During her tenure, the Red Sox won the American League East three times, but in their only World Series appearance, lost to the Mets in 1986.         Mrs. Yawkey, whose original name was Jean Remington Hollander, was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 24, 1909, and raised in Freeport, L.I.         Her first marriage apparently ended in a divorce within a short time, and from the early 1930's until the 1940's, Jean R. Hiller, as she was known, worked as a model at Jay Thorpe, a fashionable women's store on West 57th Street in Manhattan.         It was there that she supposedly met Mr. Yawkey during a visit to the store with his first wife, Elise Sparrow Yawkey. The couple, who had married in 1925, six years after Mr. Yawkey had inherited $20 million at the age of 16, divorced in November 1944, and Mr. Yawkey remarried the next month. Followed Games Closely         At Fenway, Jean and Tom Yawkey maintained his and her rooftop boxes. He liked to sit and drink with his cronies and cuss, it was once explained, while the more dignified Mrs. Yawkey sat with their wives or close friends.         Her attendance at Red Sox games was more than duty. She meticulously kept score in a custom-bound set of score cards.         Mrs. Yawkey rarely missed the annual visit to Cooperstown, N.Y., for Hall of Fame inductions. She became a major benefactor of the museum, donating two wings to the building and commissioning the famous basswood statue of Williams at work by Armand LaMontagne.         She apparently has no immediate survivors.       
         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Susan Kaplan Hopwood, a marketing and sales executive in New York City, died on Feb. 8 at her home in Newtonville, Mass. She was 55 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, her family said.         Mrs. Hopwood was advertising sales manager of Barron's, the business weekly, in the 1970's. Advertising lineage doubled in three years under her direction, and she helped initiate the overseas distribution for the publication. Moving to the parent of Barron's, Dow Jones & Company, she helped start "The Wall Street Journal Report" programs on radio and television.         From 1982 to 1988 she headed public relations for Advertising Age magazine. She ran its annual creative workshop, attracting marketing and advertising agencies from 47 countries, and helped institute annual awards for the best television commercials.         She also helped the International Advertising Association organize its annual conferences from 1986 to 1989, including its first gathering in Beijing. Recently she worked on marketing for the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Art News magazine and World Paper, an international news supplement for other publications.         For several years she worked on the board of the Manhattan Theater Club.         She was born in Brooklyn. Mrs. Hopwood was an alumna of Finch College and earned a master's degree in business from New York University.         Her marriage to Seymour N. Kaplan ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, David J. Hopwood; a daughter, Kari E. Kaplan of Manhattan; a son, Kenneth N. Kaplan of Queens; her mother, Claire Nossiter of Manhattan; a brother, Robert Singer of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and three stepchildren.       
         Frances Young Tang, a philanthropist in the field of education and a preservationist specializing in landmark buildings, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old and also had homes in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Vail, Colo.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Oscar L. Tang.         The beneficiaries of Mrs. Tang's philanthropy included the Department of East Asian Studies at Duke University, the Chinese language program at Skidmore College and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. She was a trustee of Phillips Academy at the time of her death and had been on the executive committee of the school's development board.         She was also president of Vencura Ltd., a Manhattan-based company that rehabilitates landmark buildings and has been doing work in Vail, Colo. She had also managed a Chinese catering business.         Mrs. Tang was born in Paris, the daughter of Kuangson Young, a Nationalist Chinese career diplomat who was executed during World War II by the Japanese in the Philippines. She came to the United States on an American troop ship and grew up in Manhattan.  She graduated in 1957 from Abbot Academy in Andover, Mass., which later merged with Phillips Academy, and in 1961 from Skidmore College.         She was married in 1960 to Mr. Tang, who is the president of Reich & Tang, a financial services firm with headquarters in Manhattan.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Juliana Koo of Manhattan, who is the widow of V. K. Wellington Koo, a Nationalist Chinese diplomat who was an ambassador to Washington and a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague; three daughters, Tracy Tang Limpe, Dana and Kristin, all of Manhattan; a son, Kevin, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Genevieve Young of Manhattan and Shirley Young of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Manhattan.       
         Anne Pappenheimer Forbes, a noted endocrinology researcher and clinician, died on Tuesday at her home in Milton, Mass. She was 80 years old.         She died of Hodgkin's disease, her family said.         Dr. Forbes was chosen in 1939 as the associate of Dr. Fuller Albright, the chief of endocrinology at the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.         They and their colleagues helped develop endocrinology. She participated in the identification of many diseases, including Forbes-Albright Syndrome, a pituitary gland ailment.         She became a professor at the medical school and a doctor at the hospital, where she helped create the Ovarian Dysfunction Clinic.         She worked with several hospitals in Paris in 1954 and 1955 and taught at the Pahlevi University in Shiraz, Iran, from 1967 to 1969.         After retiring in 1980, she took up gardening and raising ponies and sheep, shearing the wool herself and spinning and dyeing it by hand.         Dr. Forbes was born in New York City. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1932 and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1936 and interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1936 to 1938.         Surviving are her husband, William H.; three daughters, Beatrice F. Manz of Milton and Andrea F. Schoenfeld and Elise F. Pachter, both of Washington; two sons, Peter M. of Milton and Anthony W. of Belmont, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two brothers, Alwin M. Pappenheimer of Watertown, Mass., and John R. Pappenheimer of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Dr. Gloria Friedman Franklin, a psychoanalyst and faculty member of the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. Girard Franklin, also a psychoanalyst.         Dr. Friedman, as she was known professionally, felt it important not to hide her illness because of the effect on therapy, her husband said. When she assumed the presidency of the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society in May 1990, she gave an address titled, "Impact of a Therapist's Life -- Threatening Illness on the Therapeutic Situation." The address was published last year by the magazine Contemporary Psychoanalysis.         At the time of her death, Dr. Friedman was a training and supervising analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan besides being a member of the faculty. She was to start teaching a course on women's issues in psychoanalysis next week.         She was also a training and supervising analyst at the Institute for Psychotherapy, an attending psychologist at Roosevelt Hospital and a lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University.         She was particularly known for her work on mother-daughter relationships. In a study on raising children in The New York Times Magazine in March 1985, Dr. Friedman was quoted as saying: "The cultural expectations will always be more powerful than any biological differences. From day one, a mother treats a boy baby differently from a girl baby. Cultural imprinting is so subtle that we can't help ourselves. But it's not a bad thing. We're raising them for the culture they have to live in."         Born and raised a New Yorker, Dr. Friedman graduated from New York University, from which she also received a Ph.D. She earned a master's degree in psychology from City College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Gary, of San Francisco, and two daughters, Lisa, of Philadelphia, and Eve Lynes, of San Mateo, Calif.       
         Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn, a leading fashion model in the 1940's and 50's, died Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Huntington L.I.         She died of pneumonia, a family representative said.         An elegant blonde, the Swedish-born model posed for some of the most famous photographers of the age, including Horst P. Horst, George Hoyningen Huene and Irving Penn, whom she married in 1950. In the late 1940's, when most models were paid $10 to $25 an hour, she was earning $40 an hour. When most models's careers ended before their 30th birthdays, hers flourished until she was past 40.         She was a frequent subject of Penn's photographs for Vogue magazine, particularly his studies of French haute couture. Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of Conde Nast Publications, which publishes Vogue, said the Penns represented "an extraordinary relationship between a photographer and a model."         "She was the inspiration and subject of some of Penn's greatest photographs," Mr. Liberman said yesterday. "She epitomized a very noble period of fashion and couture. She gave a classical dignity to anything she wore." 'A Good Clothes Hanger'         Lisa Fonssagrives had a more down-to-earth attitude to her contributions as a model. She was quoted in a 1949 article in Time magazine as saying: "It is always the dress, it is never, never the girl. I'm just a good clothes hanger."         In addition to modeling, she also pursued careers as a ballet dancer, a photographer, a fashion designer and a sculptor.         She was born in Uddevalla, Sweden. Her father, a dentist who also painted, changed the family name from Anderson, which he considered too commonplace, to Bernstone. Her mother made clothes and encouraged Lisa to study art and ballet.         Lisa Bernstone went to Paris to pursue a dancing career. She met and married Fernand Fonssagrives, a dancer, there in 1935. Photographs Led to Modeling         A year later, Horst took some photographs of her that led to a modeling career. Pictures of her appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1939, she worked both as a model and as a photographer.         She continued both careers after her divorce and subsequent marriage to Penn. After she stopped modeling in the mid-50's, she designed clothes for about six years, at one point doing a collection of leisure wear for Lord & Taylor.         In the 1960's, she devoted her time to sculpturing, working in marble, bronze and fiberglass. She was represented by the Marlborough Gallery.         A book on her work as a model is scheduled for publication later this year in Germany.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer, and a son, Tom Penn, a metal designer, both of New York City; by two sisters, Lilian Bernstone and Kajsa Lundquist, both of Sweden, and by two grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Man Sarcka, a founder of Spring Lake Ranch in Vermont, one of the earliest halfway houses for the mentally ill, died on Sunday at Hampshire House, a community care home in East Montpelier, Vt. She was 98 years old and lived much of her life in Long Island City and Richmond Hill, Queens.         She died of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Sarcka and her husband, Wayne, established Spring Lake Ranch at Cuttingsville, Vt., in 1932 for people with mental and emotional problems and ran it for 30 years. Their therapeutic approach, based on the participation of both staff members and residents in ranch affairs, attracted national attention.         Retiring to the island of Jamaica in 1961, the Sarckas organized a school for adults in the mountain community of Malvern. After her husband's death in 1969, Mrs. Sarcka returned to Queens.         Active in volunteer work at the United Nations, Mrs. Sarcka was president of the Queens Chapter of the United Nations Association from 1975 to 1979. She also served as executive secretary of the League of Nations Association of Greater New York from 1927 to 1928.         A graduate of Barnard College, she was honored with the distinguished alumna award in 1983 and the Barnard Medal of Distinction in 1985.         Born in New York City, she came from a prominent New York family. Her father, Alrick H. Man, a Wall Street lawyer, developed the community of Kew Gardens in Queens, on property that had been bought by her grandfather, Alban P. Man.         She is survived by her daughter, Anne of Montpelier, Vt.; a niece, Lucy Jinishian of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a nephew, Alrick Man 3d of South Londonderry, Vt.       
         Rose Korn Hirschman, a real-estate lawyer and volunteer at the United Nations and other organizations, died Jan. 24 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver failure, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up there and in Brooklyn. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees at New York University. She began practicing law in Manhattan with her brother, Ashton Korn, and after his death worked on her own.         For nine years she represented the International Federation of Women Lawyers at United Nations commissions dealing with discrimination, minorities, women, economics, crime, commodities trade, human rights and population growth.         She was a past president of the Sisterhood of the Community Synagogue, vice president of the Congregation Emanuel Sisterhood and chairwoman of its youth activities and board member of the Young Women's Hebrew Association. She headed the Mount Vernon branch of the American Red Cross and served on the board of its Westchester County chapter. She was also on the boards of the Mount Vernon Nursing School and Mount Vernon Hospital and founded the hospital's volunteer services.         Her husband, Dr. Sol Hirschman, is dead. She is survived by two daughters, Judge Aileen Hirschman Belford of Fall River, Mass., and E. Judith Hirschman Berger of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Richard James Hirschman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Frances Adlerstein Koestler, an author and an expert on blindness, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory illness, her relatives said.         Mrs. Koestler wrote "The Unseen Minority" (McKay, 1976), a study of blindness in the United States. From 1978 to 1984 she was the editor of The Ziegler Magazine for the Blind, which selects articles from other publications for reprinting in Braille and recording on audio tape.         She also wrote freelance articles and book reviews for The New York Times, Newsday, The Washington Post, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Detroit Free Press, The Nation and American Mercury.         Her husband, Milton, who was a perfume business executive, is dead. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marjorie McKeown Clay, widow of Gen. Lucius D. Clay, commander of American forces in Europe after World War II, died of pneumonia on Saturday at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington. She was 94 years old and lived in McLean, Va.         Mrs. Clay, a graduate of Barnard College, was living with her husband in Berlin in 1948 when one of the cold war's worst crises developed. A Soviet land blockade cut off the divided city, leading to the American airlift that supplied West Berliners with food and fuel for 327 days. As part of that effort, Mrs. Clay, a longtime volunteer for children's and other charitable causes, organized Operation Vittles, in which supply planes dropped parachutes bearing packets of candy for West Berlin's children.         General Clay died in 1978.         Mrs. Clay is survived by two sons, both retired generals, Lucius D. Clay Jr. of the Air Force, a resident of Alexandria, Va., and Frank B. Clay of the Army, who lives in Chevy Chase, Md.; seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Emilia Sherman Maurer, who put the Rockettes through their paces from the gala opening of Radio City Music Hall on Dec. 27, 1932, until she retired as director of the dancers more than 40 years later, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett, L.I. She lived in Point Lookout, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Miss Sherman, who used her maiden name professionally, had kept her age a secret and left "explicit instructions" that it remain so, her son said. She died after a long illness, he said.         A close associate of Russell E. Markert, who founded the Rockettes in 1926, Miss Sherman choreographed many of the young dancers' routines. These included signature tap routines as well as her specialty, dance presentations she developed from the folk dances of many nations.         When Mr. Markert moved his troupe to Rockefeller Center in 1932, Miss Sherman became its captain as well as a dancer in the chorus line. She drilled the other dancers, showed them their steps and movements and kept them in line.         She quickly became a principal aide to Mr. Markert and, for more than 15 years, was his associate director. She became director upon his retirement in 1971. She retired in 1973.         Miss Sherman, a native of New York City, attended Professional Children's School here and later studied ballet and flamenco dancing. She made her vaudeville debut at the age of 6 and first went on a Broadway stage when she was 12 years old.         She learned her first tap steps from another dancer in Shubert Alley minutes before an audition, winning a job as a specialty act. From then on, she was known for her ability to pick up steps quickly and create new ones on her own.         This led her to choreography as a career. At Radio City, this entailed conjuring up a new spectacle with every change in the movie program, about once a month. Miss Sherman also played den mother and sergeant major to the 46 precision dancers in the troupe, any 36 of whom kicked off four times daily in a wheeling straight line nearly a city block long. In addition, she rehearsed the dancers four hours a week.         Miss Sherman is survived by her husband of 56 years, Henry S. Maurer; their son, Henry S. Jr., of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a daughter, Arnelle Liblit of Commack, L.I., and one grandson.       
         Heidi Draper, who as Heidi Vosseler was a member of George Balanchine's first American ballet company, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 74 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said her daughter, Pamela.         Miss Vosseler danced from 1935 to 1938 with the American Ballet, which was founded by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and Edward M. M. Warburg in 1934, a year after Balanchine arrived in the United States from Europe. Miss Vosseler performed in Balanchine's first American ballet, "Serenade," in his "Alma Mater," and in dances he created for two opera productions at the Metropolitan. She was featured in two Broadway musicals, "The Boys from Syracuse," choreographed by Balanchine, and "Louisiana Purchase."         Miss Vosseler married the tap dancer Paul Draper in 1941 and lived with him in Europe until returning to the United States in 1954.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, two other daughters, Susan Kosowski of Fishkill, N.Y., and Kate Draper of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.

         Shirley Ullman Wedeen, a Brooklyn College educator and past chairwoman of the City University's Faculty Senate, died on Thursday at home in Brooklyn.         She was 65 years old and died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Wedeen taught education courses at Brooklyn College since 1948 and was also assistant dean of students from 1966 to 1968.         Her academic specialty was reading skills. She created the first remedial reading program in the City University system and ran it from 1961 to 1964. She also wrote two books, "College Remedial Reader" (Putnam, 1958) and "Advanced College Reader (Putnam, 1963).         She was elected chairwoman of the Faculty Senate for the entire City University from 1986 to 1990, and in that post sat as an ex-officio member on the university's Board of Trustees. She had also served as the Senate's vice chairwoman for four years and its Governance Committee chairwoman for two years.         Dr. Wedeen graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946. At New York University she earned a master's degree in guidance counseling in 1947 and a doctorate in psychology in 1951.         Surviving are her husband, Dr. Peter Wedeen; two sons, Dr. Van Wedeen of Boston, and Dr. Glenn Wedeen of Manhattan, and her father, Hugo Ullman of Brooklyn.       
         Elinor White Montgomery, until recently the board chairwoman of the New York City School Volunteer Program, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Montgomery's volunteer work also included her serving as a trustee of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and the Thacher School in Ojai, Calif. She also served on committees of the Environmental Defense Fund.         The school volunteer program includes a reading project in which hundreds of New Yorkers, including celebrities like Mike Wallace and Christopher Reeve, read aloud to third graders to help spur their interest in reading.         She was born in Oyster Bay, L.I. She graduated from Smith College and for several years taught at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, George C., an investment banker; a daughter, Diana, of Manhattan; two sons, George, of Riverside, Conn., and Jonathan, of Manhattan; a sister, Sheila English of New Haven; a brother, Alexander White of Manhattan and Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Cecile Ruth Sands, who served for six years as the only woman on New York City's Board of Education and also worked for charitable causes, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         After her surprise appointment in 1955 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Mrs. Sands immediately became a pivotal member of the board and took controversial stands against McCarthyism and for integration.         In her first year on the board she was the sole dissenter against a measure to force school workers to inform on employees who had been Communists. Her view was vindicated when four teachers, who renounced the party but refused to inform on others, appealed to the State Education Commissioner. He overruled the board, saying, "This type of inquisition has no place in the school system."         In a 1957 talk to the Central Synagogue in Manhattan, she called for school integration to overcome the effects of racial separation in neighborhood housing patterns.         For 60 years she was on the board of the Hebrew Education Society, which ran a settlement house in Brooklyn, and was its first female president. She was an officer in the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Jewish Welfare Board.         Her husband of 36 years, Dr. Irving J. Sands, a neurologist and psychiatrist, is deceased. She is survived by two sons, Dr. William L. of Albany, N.Y., and Dr. Richard H. of Westport, Conn.; seven grandchildren; five great grandchildren, and a brother, Dr. Eugene A. Humbert of Atlantis, Fla.       
         Lettie Gay Carson, who fought to save railroad service both in New York and Pennsylvania, died on Wednesday at her home in Newtown, Pa. She was 91 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Sally Carson, said.         Mrs. Carson, who was born in Pike County, Ill., and graduated from the University of Illinois, came to New York in the early 1920's. From 1927 until 1933, she was director of the Home Institute of The New York Herald Tribune.         In 1924, she married Gerald H. Carson, an advertising executive, who later wrote several books as a social historian, including "Cornflake Crusade."         When the Carsons moved to a retirement home in Newtown, Pa., Mrs. Carson organized a group to preserve rail service in and around Philadelphia. Her husband died in 1990.         Surviving in addition to her daughter are three grandchildren.       
         Roberta Bender Grossman, the president and publisher of Zebra Books, died on March 13 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Walter Zacharius, the chairman of Kensington Publishing Corporation, which owns Zebra Books.         Mrs. Grossman was born in Brooklyn and attended New York University. When she founded Zebra Books with Mr. Zacharius in 1975, she became, at the age of 29, the youngest president of a paperback house. Over the next decade, she expanded the company's range of titles from historical romances to both paperback and hard-cover novels and general nonfiction. Authors published by the company, with whom Mrs. Grossman worked closely, included Jerzy Kosinski, Isaac Asimov and Joyce Carol Oates. In 1988, Zebra acquired Pinnacle Books, and Mrs. Grossman took on its presidency as well.         She is survived by her husband, Robin, and a daughter, Shoshanna.       
         Nancy Walker, who played Rhoda's mother, McMillan and wife's housekeeper and a paper-towel-promoting waitress in television commercials, along with a string of brassy, loudmouthed cutups on Broadway, died yesterday at her home in Studio City, Calif. She was 69 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Frank Liberman, a family spokesman.         A long-faced, red-haired, petite actress, Miss Walker said she was never able to play what she called a "gray character."         "I don't understand it myself," she said in 1976, "but I have this effect on people, so when I walk onstage, they start laughing."         That is pretty much what happened when through a case of mistaken identity she got her big break on Broadway at age 19. Her father, who was an acrobat, asked his agent to send her to see the producer George Abbott, who was auditioning actors for a new comedy, "Best Foot Forward."  Genesis of a Comedian         She was introduced as Miss Walker -- Mr. Abbott and Richard Rodgers had been expecting a singer named Helen Walker -- and began belting out a song called "Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four." Mr. Abbott built up the "blind date" role in "Best Foot Forward" from five lines to a leading role, making her an instant success.         She knew from age 10, she said, that she wanted to be a performer. But she said she did not realize that she could be a comedian until she started getting laughs in "Best Foot Forward."         "After that," she said, "people just kept writing parts for me."         But she said it was not a case of art imitating life. "Not so talkative" was how she once compared herself with the chatty characters she played onstage and on television.         "I've always thought people who are on, offstage, save very little for onstage," she said in 1976. "You can't keep the mask on all the time: it flakes."         Miss Walker, whose name originally was Anna Myrtle Swoyer, was born on May 10, 1922, in Philadelphia. Her father changed his name to Dewey Barto when he joined a vaudeville act called the Three Bartos. When Miss Walker was 3 weeks old, her mother went back on the vaudeville circuit herself, and Miss Walker slept backstage. She crawled out into the spotlight one night when she was 10 months old and stole the show.         After her success in "Best Foot Forward," M-G-M flew her to Hollywood and signed her to a seven-year contract. She appeared in the movie version of the play and in "Girl Crazy" and "Broadway Rhythm," playing variations of the blind-date character she had mastered on Broadway. She also appeared in "Lucky Me," which starred Doris Day and Robert Cummings.         On Broadway, she also starred as the jaded cabdriver Brunnhilde Esterhazy in "On the Town" in 1944 and later appeared in "Pal Joey," "Wonderful Town," "Look, Ma, I'm Dancin"' and "Do, Re, Mi," a spoof of the jukebox industry in which she played Phil Silvers's long-suffering wife. 'The Quicker Picker-Upper'         She was also the face that launched a million rolls of paper towels in television commercials beginning in the 1970's, saying: "Bounty. It's the quicker picker-upper."         She was not defensive about making commercials. "One minute's work done well is just as important as one hour," she said. "Look, if it were a bad minute, I'd feel terrible, because I get paid very well, and that would be cheating. I'm not cheating anybody. I mean, an artist is an artist no matter what he does. Besides, if I weren't doing those commercials well, I'd not have gotten on the Mary Tyler Moore show."         On "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," she played Rhoda Morgenstern's overbearing mother, and went on to a regular role when Valerie Harper, as Rhoda, got a series of her own. In 1974, when Rhoda was finally married after a long run as Miss Moore's unmarried best friend, all Rhoda and Joe wanted was a small ceremony before a justice of the peace. But as Rhoda's mother, Ida Morgenstern, Miss Walker was determined to have a slightly more elaborate ceremony in her Bronx apartment. Rhoda wanted no more than a dozen guests. Ida invited 79.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig, and their daughter, Miranda Craig who lives in Los Angeles.       
         Mary Ann Herman, a leading folk-dance teacher and an authority on folk-dance traditions, died on Monday at her home in North Babylon, L.I. She was 79 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her husband, Michael Herman.         With the idea that dancing was for everyone, Mr. and Mrs. Herman helped to introduce several generations of American students to the richness of folk dances.         "If you can walk, you can learn to dance," Mrs. Herman said in an interview in 1979.         The Hermans seemed never to tire of learning about dances from many cultures and, in their teaching, they emphasized not only the spatial patterns of dances, but also their underlying emotional significance.         Mrs. Herman, who was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, married Mr. Herman in 1930. They supervised folk dancing at the American Commons of the New York World's Fair in 1939. They taught 46 dances from 16 nations when they toured Japan for six weeks under the auspices of the State Department in 1956.         The Hermans directed their own school and dance center, Folk Dance House, from 1950 to 1970. In recent years, Mrs. Herman remained active as a teacher, using her home as headquarters, and she taught every summer at Folk Dance Camp, in Bridgton, Me.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Alexander Bodnar of Floral Park, L.I.

The show "Rhoda" ended in 1978, after a five-year run. Miss Walker also appeared in the series "McMillan and Wife" from 1971 to 1976, playing a sassy housekeeper. She was also the host of "The Nancy Walker Show," which had a brief run in 1976.         Miss Walker's most recent work was a starring role in "True Colors," a sitcom on Fox.         Miss Walker is survived by her husband, David Craig; a daughter, Miranda Craig, and a sister, Betty Lou Barto, both of Los Angeles.       
         Naome Lewis, a longtime magazine editor, died on March 18 at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         She died of bone marrow cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis began working at Trains magazine in Milwaukee before World War II. In the mid-1940's she joined McFadden Publishing in Manhattan as an articles editor at True Detective. Several years later she became an associate fiction editor at Collier's.         In 1958 she joined Good Houskeeping, where she was the fiction editor from 1960 until her retirement in 1989. At the magazines, she condensed and adapted numerous best-selling novels, including works by Erich Marie Remarque, Jessamyn West, Arthur Hailey, Pearl S. Buck, Daphne du Maurier and Virginia Holt.         Mrs. Lewis, who was born in Deerfield, Wis., was drawn to editing by her fondness for reading.         Surviving are her husband of 30 years, Robert E. Lewis, a literary agent; two daughters, Ellen J. and Sarah E., both of Manhattan; a brother, James Simonson of Minneapolis, , and a sister, Sonja Schrag of La Crosse, Wis.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M.

         Leueen MacGrath, an actress and playwright who co-wrote the 1955 Broadway musical "Silk Stockings" with her third husband, George S. Kaufman, died on Friday at her home in London. She was 77 years old.         Her stepdaughter, Anne Kaufman Schneider, said Miss MacGrath died after complications of a stroke last November.         As a playwright, Miss MacGrath collaborated on three Broadway shows with Mr. Kaufman while they were married: "The Small Hours" (1951), "Fancy Meeting You Again" (1952) and "Silk Stockings," a lampoon of life in the Soviet Union that starred Don Ameche and Hildegarde Neff. The show had music and lyrics by Cole Porter and a book by Mr. Kaufman, Miss MacGrath and Abe Burrows.         Miss MacGrath (her name was pronunced lew-EEN mac-GRAW) made her Broadway debut in 1948 in a starring role in "Edward, My Son," by Robert Morley and Noel Langley, after first performing in the play in London. She was also cast in the 1949 Hollywood movie version of the play starring Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr.         Miss MacGrath's many other New York successes included roles in "The Enchanted" (1950), "The Potting Shed" (1957), "The Love of Four Colonels" (1959), "Farewell, Farewell Eugene" (1960), "Ghosts" (1961) and "A Tribute to Lili Lamont" (1976).         Her screen credits also included "Pygmalion" and "Three Cases of Murder."         In 1976, when Miss MacGrath appeared as the grand actress Irina Arkadina in Chekhov's "Seagull" at the Manhattan Theater Club, Clive Barnes, writing in The New York Times, said her work was "one of the best individual performances on view anywhere in New York at present."         Miss MacGrath's final London appearances were in "Voyage Round My Father," opposite Alec Guinness, in 1966, and in "A Bequest to the Nation," with Zoe Caldwell, in 1970.         Miss MacGrath was born on July 3, 1914, in London. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, she made her debut in a West End production of "Beggars in Hell." During World War II she performed for the troops in an acting unit with Emlyn Williams.         She was married and divorced five times. Her husbands were Christopher Burn, Desmond Davis, Mr. Kaufman, Stephen Goodyear and Stephen Quinto.         She is survived by a sister, Eila Phillips, who lives in England, and Ms. Schneider, of New York City.       
         Mary Osborne, one of the few women to gain jazz stardom as a guitarist and the first woman to play the electric guitar professionally, died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70 years old.         She died of liver failure as a result of cancer, said her son Ralph Scaffidi Jr.         Both her parents were guitarists, and Ms. Osborne -- whose family name was Orsborn -- became fascinated by stringed instruments as a child. She began playing the ukulele when she was 4 and at 10 she joined a string band led by her father in which she played banjo. She had started playing guitar a year earlier, and while she was in grammar school she was playing jazz violin. 'The Most Startling Thing'         She sang and played guitar in her hometown, Bismarck, N.D., in her teen-age years. When she was 17 some fellow musicians urged her to hear the Al Trent Sextet, which was playing a one-night stand in Bismark. One musician played an instrument she had never seen or heard before: an electric guitar. The guitarist was Charlie Christian.         "The only electric guitar I knew of was the Hawaiian guitar," she said. "I'd listen to all the jazz guitarists of the time, but they all played acoustic. But here was Charlie Christian playing Django Reinhardt's 'St. Louis Blues' note for note but with an electric guitar. It was the most startling thing I'd ever heard."         The next day, she found a guitar like Christian's. It cost $85; for $45, a friend built an amplifier for her. From then on, she was an electric guitarist.         She went on the road with an all-female trio. When they played St. Louis, Buddy Rogers, the movie star-turned-band leader, heard them and added them to his band. The Rogers band broke up when it reached New York, but Ms. Osborne quickly got jobs at radio stations and recording studios and joined in jam sessions in clubs on West 52d Street. She eventually formed her own trio.         With her husband, Ralph Scaffidi, a trumpet player, she moved to Bakersfield in 1968 where they formed and ran the Osborne Guitar Company, which later became the Osborne Sound Laboratories, a manufacturer of amplifiers and public-address systems. She appeared at the Kool Jazz Festival in New York in 1981 and played at the Village Vanguard two years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Bakersfield, she is survived by her husband, another son, Peter, of Clovis, N.M.; a daughter, Susan Chidgey of Bakersfield; a brother, Elvy Orsborn, and a sister, Louise Orsborn.       
         Kathryn Beliveau Feuer, a scholar of Russian literature who ruffled the Soviet authorities by befriending dissident intellectuals during the cold war, died Sunday at The Cedars rehabilitation center in Charlottesville, Va. She was 65 years old and lived in Charlottesville, where she was a professor at the University of Virginia.         She died of complications after hip surgery, her family said.         Dr. Feuer published a novel at the age of 21 and, during a long career as an educator, headed the Slavic languages departments at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Toronto.         During a research visit to Russia in 1963, she brought in miniature copies of "Doctor Zhivago" and secretly passed out the contraband to dissidents. She also arranged for the manuscript of Anna Akhmatova's "The Requiem," a lengthy anti-Stalin poem, to be smuggled out of Russia, thus enabling its publication in the West.         Toward the end of Dr. Feuer's trip, she and her daughter were roughed up by Soviet agents in a sleeper compartment on a train, she later told American officials.         On another day, the police in Leningrad searched Dr. Feuer's possessions and demanded that she sign confessions of having met with dissidents. But having already memorized and destroyed her notes on those meetings, she admitted nothing and was let go.         Dr. Feuer helped Eastern European exiles settle in the West, bringing Czeslaw Milosz, the Polish poet and later a Nobel laureate, to Berkeley and Josef Skvorecky, an award-winning Czechoslovak novelist, to Toronto.         Dr. Feuer was born in Brooklyn and grew up mostly in Nutley, N.J. In 1946, she graduated from Vassar College, where she was the editor of the literary magazine. At the age of 21 she won Mademoiselle magazine's 1947 fiction award for a short story, and soon afterward Doubleday published her only novel, "Strike for the Heart," about a young woman's soul-searching.         She earned a master's degree at Columbia University in 1954 and a doctorate there in 1965 with a thesis based on research of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" manuscripts at his estate in Russia, where she stayed in 1963. That trip was her second to the country; in 1955 she was one of the first American exchange visitors permitted in the cold-war era.         Surviving are her husband, Lewis Feuer, a noted sociologist, philosopher, and social critic; a daughter, Robin F. Miller of Newton, Mass., a professor of Russian literature at Brandeis University, and three granddaughters.       
         La Lupe, a singer who was known during the late 1960's as the Queen of Latin Soul, died on Feb. 28 at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She was 53 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, a hospital spokesman said.         La Lupe had a raspy voice and an uninhibited stage presence; she shook her long hair, shimmied in low-cut dresses and tossed her beads and shoes to the crowds. A string of hits she made with the bandleader Tito Puente in the mid-1960's established her as one of the most popular performers in Latin music.         La Lupe was born Lupe Victoria Yoli in Santiago, a village in Oriente Province in Cuba. At her parents' insistence, she earned a teaching degree, but she had also been winning local singing contests, and decided to go into performing. She married a singer in the trio Los Tropicuba; after her first performance, he said he thought she was having an epileptic fit. She soon divorced him and began working on her own, and by 1960 she was a leading performer in Havana nightclubs. She bought her own club, but after difficulties with the Fidel Castro Government -- "Castro take my club, my money, my car," she told Look magazine in 1971 -- she emigrated to the United States, and settled in New York in 1962. The Making of a Star         Soon after she arrived, she began singing with orchestras led by Mongo Santamaria and Mr. Puente, with whom she recorded a number of hit singles, including "Que Te Pedi." By the end of the 1960's, she was a star in her own right, working with Mr. Puente and with other bandleaders, and touring the United States and Latin America.         In the mid-1970's, her jobs in New York City dwindled, and she moved to Puerto Rico, where she played concerts and television programs. She returned to New York, but her career had declined and her second husband's medical expenses depleted her savings. By the early 1980's she was living on welfare. In 1984, while hanging a curtain, she fell, injured her spine and was paralyzed; not long afterward, an electrical fire burned down her house. She sang with Mr. Puente for the last time in 1985, from a wheelchair, at a concert to help pay her expenses.         According to Vernon Boggs's "Salsiology," a history of salsa in New York published by Excelsior and Greenwood, La Lupe regained her ability to walk after being blessed by an evangelical Christian preacher. She began singing Christian music, performing regularly at Iglesia Pentecostal el Fin Se Acerca (Pentecostal Church: The End is Near) in the Bronx. She also recorded a series of albums in salsa and Mexican styles with devotional lyrics.         She is survived by her son, Rene Camano, and her daughter, Rainbow Garcia, both of the Bronx.       
         Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.         She died of cancer, a relative said.         Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.         Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.         Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.         She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.       
         Maria-Helena Vieira da Silva, a painter prominently associated with the School of Paris, died in Paris on March 6. The Portuguese-born artist was 83 years old and had lived in Paris since 1928.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for the French Ministry of Culture.         Although Miss Vieira da Silva had been a French citizen since 1956, she was regarded by many as Portugal's greatest contemporary artist. Her poetic canvases, vast semi-abstractions in which mosaiclike patches of color were linked by lines into labyrinthine compositions, interested artists of the American Abstract Expressionist school, who first saw her work in New York in 1946.         To observe her 80th birthday in 1988, a major Vieira da Silva retrospective was presented at the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon and the Grand Palais in Paris. Her paintings are in important museum collections throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, the Tate Gallery in London, the Stedelijk in Amsterdam, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. She was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government and France's National Arts Prize in 1966. In 1961, she won the painting prize at the prestigious Sao Paulo Bienal in Brazil. One Theme Was War         The themes of her paintings are varied: landscapes, games, city streets, atmospheric effects, the seasons, spatial arrangements. Influences on her work ranged from the winding streets of her native Lisbon and the traditional glazed tiles of Portugal to the horrors of World War II. During that period, canvases like "Le Metro" and "The Disaster" of 1942 reflected the grim scene in Europe.         Miss Vieira da Silva was born in Lisbon on June 13, 1908. At 19, she began to study sculpture in Paris with Antoine Bourdelle and Charles Despiau; later she took up painting under the tutelage of Fernand Leger and Othon Friesz. Her first show was in 1933 at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, she and her husband, Arpad Szenes, a Hungarian-born painter she married in 1930, fled to Rio de Janeiro. There she did murals for the University of Agriculture and had several solo exhibitions. The couple's home in Rio became a gathering place for emerging Brazilian artists.         Miss Vieira da Silva's first postwar exhibition was in New York in 1946 at the Marian Willard Gallery. The next year, she returned to Paris, where she exhibited regularly, working until shortly before her death. She also had a studio in Lisbon, and a former silk factory near it is now being turned into a museum of her work.         Mr. Szenes died in 1985. The couple had no children.       
         Betty Lou Haydnet Ourisman, a former board member of the Arena Stage and Ford's Theater in Washington, who was long active in philanthrophic and cultural organizations in the capital area, died yesterday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 66 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         She is survived by her husband, Mandell J. Ourisman; two sons by a previous marriage, Daniel L. Korengold, of Washington, and Thomas E. Korengold, of Chevy Chase; three stepsons, David J. Ourisman of Eatontown, N.J., John M. Ourisman of Bethesda, Md., and Robert B. Ourisman of Washington; her mother, Hannah Haydnet of Minneapolis; a sister, Patricia Chanin of New York City, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Harriet Mandelbaum, who spent decades of her life working in behalf of autistic and other mentally impaired children, died on Thursday at Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 79 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Her family said a cerebral hemorrhage caused her death.         She was active both in her community and on the national level. A member of the United States Joint Commission on Mental Health for Children, she toured the country to speak about the special needs of such children. In 1951, she helped found the League for Emotionally Disturbed Children, which was dedicated to promoting educational and therapeutic facilities.         The league became the National Organization for Mentally Ill Children in 1955, and Mrs. Mandelbaum was its first president. For many years, she was involved in the growth of the League Treatment Center, for both children and adults, in Brooklyn, and of the League School. She was the first head of the school's board after it was founded in 1953.         Mrs. Mandelbaum is survived by her husband, Dr. Joseph Mandelbaum, himself a past president of the League School; two sons, Paul Mandelbaum, of Brooklyn, and Dr. Joel Mandelbaum, of Kingston, N.Y.; a daughter, Jo Travis, of Branchville, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Quaintance Eaton, a writer of books and articles on opera, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She died of complications of a stroke, said Bill Cunningham, a longtime friend.         Miss Eaton was born in Kansas City, Mo.,and became a devotee of opera long before moving to New York City in the 1920's. She frequently wrote on the subject for Musical America, eventually becoming an associate editor, and was a contributing editor to Opera News.         In 1957, her book "Opera Caravan," an anecdotal history of the Metropolitan Opera on tour, was praised by Howard Taubman, then chief music critic of The New York Times, as "both diverting and informative."         In the 1960's, she published two histories that have become standard works: "The Boston Opera Company" (1965) and "The Miracle of the Met" (1968). She was also executive secretary of the National Federation of Music Clubs and of the New York City Opera Guild.         Her last book, published in 1987, was "Sutherland and Bonynge: An Intimate Biography," about Dame Joan Sutherland and her husband, the conductor Richard Bonynge.         Miss Eaton was known among opera audiences for the chinchilla coat she wore and for her collection of stylish hats, said to number 250.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Miriam Borgenicht Klein, the author of 17 suspense novels under the name of Miriam Borgenicht, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76 years old.         She died of lymphoma, her family said.         Mrs. Klein graduated from Barnard College in 1936 and worked for the Works Progress Administration during the Depression.         Mrs. Klein's first mystery, "Corpse in Diplomacy," was published in 1949, and her most recent, "No Duress," came out in 1991. She completed her last, yet unpublished, by dictating the conclusion to a daughter from her hospital bed.         She is survived by her husband, Milton; three daughters, Elizabeth Hersh, of Washington; Emily Abel, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Margaret Nelson of Middlebury, Vt.; two sons, James, of Takoma Park, Md., and Thomas, of New York; a sister, Joan Aron, of Washington, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Edna Simon Levine, a psychologist who founded many programs to help deaf people, died on April 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart ailment, a friend said.         Dr. Levine devoted her career to the problems of people with impaired hearing as an advocate, author, teacher, researcher, clinician and trainer of other professionals.         She organized the first comprehensive dictionary of sign language in 1964, which standardized the signs. She formed the Deaf Repertory Theater, helped create the Foundation for the Deaf and worked on adapting telephones for the deaf, including experiments with video telephones.         As a psychologist, Dr. Levine focused on helping deaf people cope with feelings of social isolation from hearing people. Directed U.N. Program         She directed a 1972 United Nations Task Force on Deafness and a 1974 national conference on training psychological workers for the deaf. She initiated the New York State Psychiatric Institute's mental health program for the deaf and founded New York University's research and training center for deafness rehabilitation, a forerunner of centers elsewhere.         Among her books were "Youth in a Soundless World" (New York University, 1956), "Psychology of Deafness" (Columbia University, 1960) and "Lisa and Her Soundless World" (Human Sciences, 1974), which was chosen as the children's book of the year by the Child Study Association of America. Her other honors included an honorary doctorate from Gallaudet University, which educates deaf students.         She was a past president of the Psychology Commission of the World Federation for the Deaf and a former board member of the American Psychological Association, the American Hearing Society, the Inter-Branch Library Association of New York and the New York League for the Hard of Hearing.         Dr. Levine, who was not deaf, was born in New York City and got started in the field after she trained as a teacher at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate in psychology at New York University, where she later taught educational psychology for 15 years. She also earned a master's in special education at Columbia.         Her husband, Dr. Matthew Levine, a psychiatrist, is deceased. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Sara Chisholm Farrington, a writer and a pioneer in international big-game fishing, died Thursday at Southhampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 84 years old.         She died of pneumonia after suffering a stroke, her family said.         Brought up in Manhattan and Long Island, she went to the Spence and Farmington schools. In 1934, she married a noted outdoorsman and author, Selwyn Kip Farrington Jr.         Mrs. Farrington, under the pen name of Chisie Farrington and as an internationally known angler with seven world records to her credit, wrote "Women Can Fish" in 1951. The book chronicled her experiences accompanying her husband on fishing trips around the world. "Women Can Fish," as well as the fishing articles she wrote in the 1930's and 40's for Harpers Bazaar, Vogue and Mademoiselle, helped to establish women as sporting participants in their own right.         The Farringtons traveled in a circle of big-game adventurers who included Ernest Hemingway and Alfred Glassell. In their company, Sara Farrington was an angler among equals: The 674-pound tuna she caught off Watch Hill, R.I., in the mid-1950's was first tuna that had ever been caught in those fishing grounds by man or woman.         She is survived by a grandniece, Patricia McCain, and a grandnephew, Charles Madeira.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

She is survived by her husband, Gabriel; a son, Jeffrey, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Jan Doughery of Sedona, Ariz; a brother, Martin Whitman of New York City; a sister, Judge Phyllis Beck of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.       
         Johnnie Lee Macfadden, an author and physical-fitness advocate, died April 6 at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A native of Fort Worth, Mrs. Macfadden had a first career as an interior designer. In 1948, she became the third wife of Bernarr Macfadden, the physical culturist and publisher who died in 1955 at the age of 87.         She was a regular monthly contributor to her husband's publications, "Physical Culture" and "Health Review," lectured on fitness, appeared on television talk shows, developed her own line of creams and lotions, and maintained a counseling service on mental and physical health in her apartment until the time of her death.         She was the author of "Barefoot in Eden: The Macfadden Plan for Health, Charm and Long-Lasting Youth," published by Prentice Hall in 1962.         Mrs. Macfadden is survived by a son, Jack of Brooklyn; a daughter, Carol Tumbridge of Denver; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.         She was also an officer of the Young Men's Christian Association, Brooklyn chapter manager for the American Red Cross and a member of the boards of the Irvington House for Children, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society and the Willoughby House Settlement.

She was 86 years old and had lived in Lawrence, L.I., since 1947.         The cause of death was cancer, according to a statement from Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Tenzer was born Florence Navor in Philadelphia. She and her husband of 62 years, former United States Representative Herbert Tenzer, took leading roles at the university for many years. Their $1 million dollar gift in 1989 endowed a Herbert and Florence Tenzer University Fellows Program to benefit outstanding students at Yeshiva's graduate schools.

         Melissa Stutsman Topping, an executive of the Henry Luce Foundation, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of complications from cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Topping was the vice president and secretary of the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan and principal staff officer of its Clare Boothe Luce Fund. She administered $21 million in grants for scholarships, fellowships and professorships for women in science, to help remedy their under-representation in that field.         She was born in St. Louis and graduated from Vassar College in 1964. After working for a law firm and Citibank, she joined the foundation in 1969, where she progressed from research assistant to program associate, program officer, associate director and vice president.         Mrs. Topping was also a trustee of Pratt Institute, manager of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York, an advisory council member of the New York Women's Foundation and a past board member of the Women's Prison Association and was also active in the Trust for Cultural Resources.

Stutsman Jr. of St. Louis; and two stepchildren, Henry J. 4th, and Samantha S. Topping, both of Manhattan.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.         She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said.         Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.         She started as a financial aide in the Ossining urban renewal agency, then worked for the New York City Office of Management and Budget. She became director of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program in Fairfield County, Conn., then was appointed the Private Industry Council's deputy director for southern Connecticut. She joined the Yonkers control board as deputy director.         Mrs. Brewster helped found Job's Refuge, a homeless shelter in Ossining.  She served on the board of the Open Door Family Health Clinic in Ossining, was a deacon for Briarcliff Congregational Church and was president of the Inter-Faith Council for Action, a housing preservation organization.         Surviving are her husband of eight years; their daughter, Catherine Eisenmann; her mother, Barbara Brewster of Ossining; and three sisters, Deborah Ferrenz of Silver Spring, Md., Abigail McGahey of Tyngsboro, Mass., and Alison Henderson of North Andover, Mass.

Mrs. Lee died of lung cancer, said Heidi Bulow, one of her grandchildren.         Mrs. Lee and her late husband, Burt Lee, had lived in White Plains from the late 1940's to 1976, when they moved to St. Thomas, V.I.

         Lydia Joel, the former editor in chief of Dance Magazine and head of the dance department at the School of Performing Arts, died on Sunday at New York Hospital She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, said her husband, Edwin Miller.         As teacher and journalist, Miss Joel helped to increase appreciation of dance as an art and to raise standards of dance writing and training. Appointed editor in chief of Dance Magazine in 1952, she began to emphasize serious criticism, essays, photographic features and foreign reports. As a result, a publication that had previously been read largely by performers and teachers came to appeal to the general dance audience.         Through her early teaching activities in Texas, she acknowledged the importance of fostering dance across America. And at the School of Performing Arts in New York, she supervised a program that prepared young people for professional careers.  Studied Two Methods         Miss Joel, whose maiden name was Tarnower, was born in New York City. She received a bachelor's degree in English from New York University and did additional graduate work at Cornell University. She studied ballet at the School of American Ballet and modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and Hanya Holm, two leaders of the German modern dance that flourished before World War II. She also attended summer sessions of the Bennington (Vt.) School of Dance, the forerunner of today's American Dance Festival.         At Bennington in 1937, Miss Joel danced in the premiere of "Trend," Miss Holm's monumentally scaled depiction of social conflicts. In New York that same year, Miss Joel appeared in Max Reinhardt's production of "The Eternal Road."         She taught in 1938 at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and from 1938 to 1944 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she headed her own company.         Her first husband was the conductor Gerhard Joel; he died in 1946 but she retained Joel as her professional name. She married Mr. Miller, the entertainment editor of Seventeen magazine, in 1953.         Miss Joel joined the staff of Dance Magazine in 1947, working in the editorial and advertising departments. When she left the publication in 1969, the staff, under her guidance, had grown from 4 to 15 people.         Miss Joel directed the dance department of the School of Performing Arts from 1973 until her retirement in 1984, producing the high school's annual concerts and arranging a performance by 12 of its students at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982.         She served on the board of directors of the American College Dance Festival, the Association of American Dance Companies and the National Association for Regional Ballet, and contributed articles to Vogue, Parents Magazine and other publications. In recent years, she lectured and wrote about Catherine de' Medici, the Renaissance monarch who influenced the development of ballet in European courts.         In addition to her husband, Miss Joel is survived by a son, Eric Miller of Manhattan, and three brothers, Irving Tarnower of Teaneck, N.J., Dr. William Tarnower of Topeka, Kans., and Gerald Tarnower of Dallas.       
         Sari Dienes, an artist whose career spanned many different media and several decades of the New York art world, died on Monday at her home in Stony Point, N.Y. She was 93 years old.         She died of cancer, said Rip Hayman, a friend and the curator of the Sari Dienes Foundation.         Mrs. Dienes, whose original name was Chylinska von Daivitz, was born in Hungary in 1898 and in her youth studied dance, music and philosophy. She was married at the age of 19 to a French mathematician, Paul Dienes, and she did not decide to become an artist until she was 29 and living in Wales with her husband. Over the next decade, she studied art in Paris and London with Ferdinand Leger, Andre Lhote and Henry Moore. Stranded in New York at the outbreak of World War II, she made the city her home, supporting herself by teaching art.  'Nothing Is So Humble'         As an artist, Mrs. Dienes had an innately experimental approach to materials and techniques and a lasting faith in the power of the found object. "Bones, lint, Styrofoam, banana skins, the squishes and squashes found on the street: nothing is so humble that it cannot be made into art," she once said, and her work tended to prove her right.         During her career she made elaborate rubbings of American Indian petroglyphs and New York City manhole covers, created assemblages out of bones and sundry other materials, painted Abstract Expressionist drip paintings and turned her studio-house in Stony Point, in Rockland County, into a walk-in art environment. When her 57th Street studio burned in 1957, Mrs. Dienes spent two years in Japan studying with a master potter, and thereafter added ceramics to her repertory.         Throughout her career, Mrs. Dienes was a more or less visible fixture on the postwar New York art scene, distinguished in later years by her round, beatific face and halo of frizzy white hair. In the 1950's she exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, a prominent showplace for the Abstract Expressionists, but her work was more in the neo-Dada spirit of younger artists like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg and the composer John Cage, who were her friends.  Influence of Encouragement         In a short reminiscence that appears in a catalogue for an exhibition of Mrs. Dienes's work that is touring Europe, the art dealer Leo Castelli says that in the 1950's, Mrs. Dienes "was very encouraging to the younger artists and gave their new work her seal of approval."         "In this way she exerted a real influence," he adds.         He also notes that Mrs. Dienes gave Mr. Rauschenberg the large stuffed eagle he used in "Canyon," one of his most famous combine paintings.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Dienes became an early member of A.I.R., the first women's cooperative art gallery in the United States. Her most recent exhibition at A.I.R., a retrospective that closed last month, included a number of Styrofoam prints and paintings that the artist made in the 1980's. In her later years she was also the principal owner of the Ear Inn, a bar on Spring Street west of SoHo known for its new music and performance programs.         Mrs. Dienes's husband died in London in 1955. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Gillian Barr Rudd, who ran a marketing firm and was a leader in national efforts to foster business ownership by women, died on Tuesday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 49 years old and lived in Washington.         She died of ovarian cancer, her company said.         Ms. Rudd was the president of the Rudd Company, a publications and marketing company in Washington.         She was the chairwoman of the National Foundation for Women Business Owners and vice president of the World Association of Women Entrepreneurs.         In 1988 she was was a lead witness at Congressional hearings that led to the Omnibus Women's Business Ownership Act of 1991. The act created the National Women's Business Council to promote businesswomen's access to contracts, purchase orders, credit, statistics and managerial and technical assistance.         Born in Forest of Dean in England, Ms. Rudd grew up there and in Sri Lanka. She emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her husband, T. James Rudd. She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.         Ms. Rudd was divorced. She is survived by her mother, Alma Lewis of Gloucestershire, England, and a brother, Frank Barr of Victoria, British Columbia.       
         Marjorie Severyns Ravenholt, an expert on Asia for government, news and non-profit organizations, died on Monday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 71 years old.         She died of complications after surgery for lung cancer, said her husband, Albert. The couple lived in Seattle and in Manila.         Mrs. Ravenholt's Asian ties began when she was an exchange student in Japan, Korea and Manchuria. In World War II, she served in India and China as an intelligence agent for the United States Office of Strategic Services, then became a correspondent in China for Life magazine.         She served as an analyst for a United States economic mission to China and later was director of education and information for the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which modernized much of Taiwan. Public Service Awards         For 30 years, Mrs. Ravenholt also helped run the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, financed by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, to honor Asians for public service and other achievement.         She was born in Sunnyside, Wash., graduated from the University of Washington and studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University. She worked briefly for the United States Board of Economic Warfare at the beginning of World War II.         She and her husband were among seven veteran journalists who returned to China in 1985 at the invitation of the Government.         Mr. Ravenholt is the only immediate survivor.       
         Joan Merrill, a nightclub singer and actress, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74 years old.         She died of a stroke, said her husband, Israel Seeger.         Miss Merrill was a featured actress and singer in several movies, among them "Time Out for Rhythm" (1941) and "Iceland" (1942), in which she introduced the song "There Will Never Be Another You," which became a pop standard.         Miss Merrill was born in Baltimore. She began her career in the 1930's on radio and later sang in nightclubs across the country, including the Copacabana in New York, the Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., and the Rio Cabana in Chicago.         She is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons, William and Michael, both of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.

         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Margaret Frankel Bornstein, a longtime leader in Jewish organizations, died on Monday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. She was 73 years old and lived in Fair Lawn, N.J.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         With her husband, Julian, Mrs. Bornstein lent support to many civic and educational centers in Fair Lawn. She was the first female president of that borough's Jewish center.         Mrs. Bornstein served as president of 14 community organizations in Fair Lawn.         In addition to her husband, who is the retired president of Jacquard Fabrics in Paterson, N.J., Mrs. Bornstein is survived by three sons, Frederic, of Buffalo Grove, Ill., Andrew, of Washington, and Steven, of Westport, Conn.; a daughter, Faye Moore of Atlanta, and eight grandchildren.       
         Minnie Mazer Nathanson, a philanthropist involved in the founding of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         She died of lymphatic cancer, said her daughter, Bobbie Abrams of Manhattan.         At the time of her death, she was a member of the boards of the Brooklyn Museum and the Jewish Museum and chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel-Jewish Association for College Youth.         She and her three brothers and a sister jointly donated the funds for the construction, in the mid-1950's, of the first dormitory at Albert Einstein College. Mrs. Nathanson and her siblings gave the Mazer Building in memory of their father, Abraham Mazer, who died in 1952. Mr. Mazer was a founder and chairman of the Hudson Pulp and Paper Company, based in New York City and later sold to Georgia-Pacific.         Over the years, Mrs. Nathanson was also a vice president and trustee of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, an officer of the Council of Jewish Federations and a member of the board of the New York Association for New Americans.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Adelphi College.         Her husband, Dr. Louis Nathanson, a radiologist and member of the Albert Einstein College faculty, died in 1968.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Dr. Noel Nathanson of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anna Lopin, and a brother, William Mazer, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Geraldine Delaney Harris, a dancer and singer who appeared in several Broadway musicals in the 1950's, died on Friday at her home in Pomona, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died after a short illness, her family said.         Mrs. Harris, who was known professionally as Geraldine Delaney, appeared in "Where's Charley?," the original production of "Guys and Dolls," "Wonderful Town" and "Silk Stockings."         She is survived by her husband, Joseph, a theatrical producer and manager; three sons, James, of Pomona, Jeremiah, of New York City, and Joseph Jr., of Teaneck, N.J., and a daughter, Jennifer, of New York City.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died on Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases, she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her consulting work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians who were prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean, the sports car designer, was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas, and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Lucretia Speziale Robertson, an interior designer, died on Monday at her home in Montclair, N.J. She was 48 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         A native of Pittsburgh, she was a principal in Lang/Robertson Ltd., a residential and commercial design firm in Montclair that she helped to establish 17 years ago.         She and her partner, Donna Lang, published a book, "Decorating With Fabrics," and were working on a book on decorating with paper, scheduled for publication next year.         Mrs. Robertson is survived by her husband, William Sterling Robertson 3d, and two sons, Evan Alexander and Ian Stewart.       
         Dr. Maria Victoria Roque Cohen, who practiced internal medicine in the Bronx for 30 years, died on Monday at her home in Harrison, N.Y.         She was 61 years old. Her family said she died of breast cancer.         A native of Argentina, Dr. Roque Cohen came to the United States after her graduation from the National University of Cordoba Medical School. She and her husband, Dr. Sol Cohen, shared a private practice in Co-Op City. She was also an attending physician at Montefiore and Misericordia medical centers.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Roque Cohen is survived by two daughters, Michele and Jennifer, both of Harrison, and a brother, Alfredo of Cordoba.       
         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Kathleen (Kitty) Godfree, a two-time Wimbledon singles champion, died today. She was 96 years old.         Her death was announced by officals of Wimbledon, the prestigious grass-court tennis tournament whose 1992 edition will start on Monday. Mrs. Godfree had been living in a nursing home in her native London for many years and died of the effects of old age, tournament officials said.         Mrs. Godfree, then Kitty McKane, was the only woman to beat Helen Wills at Wimbledon. She defeated the eight-time Wimbledon champion in the 1924 final, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. Five Doubles Titles         She married Leslie Godfree, the captain of England's Wightman Cup Team, in 1926. As Kitty Godfree, she won her second Wimbledon title in 1926, beating Lili de Alvarez of Spain, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.         Mrs. Godfree also won five Grnd Slam doubles championships, all with different partners. She won the Wimbledon mixed-doubles titles in 1924 with J. Brian Gilbert, defeating her future husband and Dorothy Shepherd Barron in the final. In 1926, she teamed with Leslie Godfree to win at Wimbledon again. She also captured three doubles titles at the United States championships, two in women's, in 1923 and 1927, and one in mixed (1925).         Mrs. Godfree was one of the first emale players to move to the net and use the volley to good advantate. An all-round athlete, she also excelled at ice skating, lacrosse, cricket and croquet.         During her tennis career, she also won five Olympic medals: one gold, two silver and two bronze. The gold medal came in women's doubles with Winifred McNair at the 1920 Summer Games in Antwerp, Belgium. Honored at Wimbledon         Mrs. Godfree was a regular visitor to Wimbledon and in 1989 became the first woman to be elected a vice president of the All England Club, where the tournament is played.         In 1986, a party to mark her 90th birthday party was held at Wimbldeon, and she was given the honor of presenting Martina Navratilova with the women's singles trophy. She also attended the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the first since 1924 to include tennis as a medal sport, as a link with past Games. She continued to play tennis into her 90's.         Leslie Godfree, who became a well-known tennis coach, writer and umpire, died in 1972.         Mrs. Godfree is survived by two sons, David and Martin.       
         Alta Jablow, professor emeritus of anthropology at Brooklyn College, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was was 72 years old.         Professor Jablow died of natural causes, said her daughter, Lisa Jablow.         Professor Jablow took particular interest in how societies used folk tales to pass their histories and customs from one generation to the next. She was the author or co-author of six books on Africa and African folk tales and of children's books. She also examined the role of women in different societies.         One of her books, "The Africa That Never Was," which was written with a Brooklyn College colleague, Dorothy Hammond, examined the British experience in Africa and was published by Twain Press in 1970. Another was "Yes and No: The Intimate Folklore on Africa," which was published in 1961 by Horizon Press.         Her interest in folklore sprang from her early interest in dance as a form of telling folk tales. In the 1940's, she was a member of the Martha Graham dance company.         Born in Weehawken, N.J., Professor Jablow earned a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1940 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1963.         She joined the Brooklyn College faculty, where her husband was also on the anthropology faculty, in 1947 as an adjunct professor and became a full-time faculty member in 1965. She retired in 1980.         Professor Jablow is survived by her husband, Joseph, and her daughter, Lisa, also of Manhattan.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died yesterday afternoon at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said. "I think it was probably the effects of the disease coupled with the fact that she was 83 years old," Ms. Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminisences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues.         While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor.         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me":         "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century."         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong docummentary by a California filmmaker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominently Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, she was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' " Lessons From the Family Cook         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer.         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers, while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may was well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941. Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         In 1943, she published "The Gastronomical Me," (Duell, Sloan & Pearce) followed by "Here Let Us Feast (Viking) in 1946. Her novel, "Not Now But Now," was published by Viking in 1947. Her translation from French of "The Physiology of Taste" was published in 1949, the same year that "An Alphabet for Gourmets" appeared.         "A Cordiall Water," a slender volume of folk cures, was published by Little, Brown in 1961. Three years later, the same publisher brought out "A Map of Another Town," a reminiscence of the years she spent in Aix-en-Provence. In 1968, Putnam published "With Bold Knife and Fork," and Mrs. Fisher joined Julia Child and Michael Field as consultants to the Time-Life book "The Cooking of Provencal France."         Throughout these decades, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Fried two years later. An Appetite for Writing         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Viking.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991.         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say," she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died on Monday at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.

While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor. Ignored for Years         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me": "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking?

'On the Outside Looking In'         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F.

A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may as well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941:         "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it." Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         She saw little room at the table for caution. In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Friede two years later.         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Knopf.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991. The Tablet of Her Mind         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say." she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren. A Delicious Meal Of a Bookish Kind         Here are nine of the better-known books written by M.F.K. Fisher over the course of six decades. She wrote a total of 15.         "The Gastronomical Me" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1943), collected essays.         "Here Let Us Feast (Viking, 1946), collected essays.         "Not Now But Now" (Viking, 1947), a novel.         "An Alphabet for Gourmets" (Viking, 1949), collected essays.         "The Physiology of Taste," (Heritage Press, 1949) an English translation of Brillat-Savarin's treatise.         "A Cordiall Water," (Little, Brown, 1961), folk cures.         "A Map of Another Town," (Little, Brown, 1964), reminiscence of years in Aix-en-Provence.         "With Bold Knife and Fork," (Putnam, 1968), collected essays.         "The Cooking of Provencal France," (Time-Life, 1968); Mrs. Fisher served as a consultant with Julia Child and Michael Field.       
         The Rev. Page E. Smith Bigelow, one of the first women to be ordained in the Episcopal Church, died Wednesday in St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 69 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.         She died of cardiac arrest after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A graduate of Wells College and the General Theological Seminary in New York City, she was ordained in January 1977 after spending two years as a deacon. She served as a priest in the city's Episcopal Church Center, then as a vicar in West Milford, N.J. For the past six years her home parish had been St. George's Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Newark.         She is survived by her husband, William S.; a daughter, Page E., also of Maplewood; two sons, John O. 3d of Maplewood and William S. Jr. of Lebanon Township, N.J.; a sister, Thalia B. Husted of Mantoloking, N.J., and one grandchild.       
         Sophie Leavitt, an author of cookbooks and, with her husband, a collector of contemporary art who contributed works to several museums throughout the country, died on June 23 in her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Leavitt died of natural causes, said Brenda Collins, a spokeswoman for Levitt-Weinstein Memorial Chapels of West Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Leavitt and her husband, Boris, both lifelong collectors of art, lent many pieces from their substantial collection for temporary or permanent exhibition. The loans went to such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Addison Museum in Andover, Mass., the Washington Museum in Hagerstown, Md., and the Norton Gallery of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla.         Jack Coward, curator of the Twentieth Century collection at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, said that during the last decade the Leavitts had contributed more than 30 works.         Mrs. Leavitt and her husband were co-founders of the direct-marketing retail division of the Horn and Hardart Company.         Mrs. Leavitt was also an accomplished cook and published several cookbooks, including Sophie Leavitt's Penny Pinchers Cookbook, published by Lancer Publishers in 1971.         The book contained many recipes Mrs. Leavitt had devised from her volunteer work showing migrant families in Florida and Pennsylvania how to prepare nutritious and tasty meals. Her work earned her commendations from the United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs and the Nixon Administration, which invited her to attend the 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health.         Mrs. Leavitt is survived by her husband; three children, Lana Rosenfeld of Manhattan, Allen J. Leavitt of Las Vegas, Nev., and David L. Leavitt of Coatesville, Pa., and five grandchildren.       
         Rebecca C. Simonson, a New York City schoolteacher active in school affairs in the 1940's and 1950's, died on Sunday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Peekskill, N.Y.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her son, David C. Simonson.         Mrs. Simonson, a native of Brooklyn and a graduate of the Columbia University teacher training program, taught sixth grade at Public School 61 in the Bronx for most of her 35-year teaching career. From 1940 to 1952, she was president of the Teachers Guild, which preceded the United Federation of Teachers.         Her husband, Simon, died in 1943.         She is survived by her son, David, of Arlington, Va.; a brother, Sidney, of Norwalk, Conn.; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Frances Brice Stark, Fanny Brice's daughter, who became a philanthropist and a well-known figure in show business circles, died on Sunday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         She died after several strokes and heart failure, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Stark was born in Huntington, L.I., the daughter of Nicky Arnstein and Miss Brice, whose radio and stage career was portrayed in "Funny Girl."         As a teen-ager, the daughter became an accomplished horsewoman, winning awards at Eastern horse shows and the National Horse Show. After graduating from the Dalton School in New York, she moved to California with her mother and often accompanied her on stage tours.         For nearly 52 years she was married to the Hollywood producer Ray Stark, who produced the movie "Funny Girl" in 1968. Together they made contributions to many charitable causes and were the hosts of many social and business events. She was a regular on lists of best-dressed women.         Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Wendy Stark Morrissey, and a brother, William Brice, both of Los Angeles, and one grandchild. A son, Peter, died in 1970.       
         Ruth Cohen Sherman, a Connecticut businesswoman, died on May 31 at Norwalk Hospital. She was 68 and lived in Westport.         Mrs. Sherman died of complications from breast cancer, said her son, Robert Cohen.         Mrs. Sherman was president of Airpot, which makes a pneumatic device of that name used to control the motion of parts in photocopiers, computers and other technological equipment. Mrs. Sherman took charge of the company when her first husband, Arthur Cohen, who founded it, died in 1974.         In 1980 Mrs. Sherman was appointed to the White House Conference on Small Business, and in 1982 she became the first Connecticut woman to receive the National Award for Small Business Person from the United States Business Administration.         Mr. Sherman was born in Charleston, W.Va. She graduated from the National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington in 1938 and from Mount Holyoke College in 1942. She interrupted her graduate studies at Columbia University in the mid-1940's to marry Mr. Cohen, who died in 1974.         In addition to her son, who lives in Philadelphia, Mrs. Sherman is survived by her second husband, Melvin Sherman, a daughter, Barbara Cohen Stanley, of San Francisco, a brother Stanley Silverstein, of Charleston, W.Va., and five grandchildren.       
         Carole Mills Weinberg, a modeling agent and executive, died on Thursday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 49 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.         She was in Little Rock for treatment for cancer at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Center, her husband said.         Mrs. Weinberg was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to the United States with her family. After attending Northwestern University, she began modeling in Chicago and then taught modeling there.         Moving to New York City in the 1960's, she worked as an agent for the Sanford Leigh modeling agency, then became director of the television division of the Ford modeling agency and later director of the casting department at the Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn advertising company. She specialized in television commercials.         She and her husband, William P. Weinberg, became half-owners of Wilhelmina International Limited, the parent company of the Wilhelmina Artists and Wilhelmina Models. He was president of the Wilhelmina organizations, and she was on the board of directors. They sold their share in the company two years ago but remained as consultants for special projects.         Her survivors include her husband and her parents, Adam and Greta Boyce of Mount Prospect, Ill.       
         Emily Sears Lodge Clark, the widow of Henry Cabot Lodge, the Senator and Republican Vice-Presidential nominee in 1960, died Saturday in her house in Beverly, Mass. She was 86 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said her son Henry Sears Lodge.         Mrs. Clark was married to Forrester A. Clark, a retired investment banker, in 1987, two years after Mr. Lodge died.         She was born in Beverly, the daughter of Henry F. Sears, a doctor, and grew up partly in France. Her schooling as a child came largely from tutors.         She met Mr. Lodge at a debutante party in Boston, and they were married in 1926. She was at his side while Mr. Lodge was a Senator from Massachusetts, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to South Vietnam and Ambassador to West Germany.         In addition to her husband, Mr. Clark, she is survived by two sons, George Cabot Lodge and Henry Sears Lodge, both of Beverly; 10 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Margaretha Ley, chief designer and co-founder of Escada AG, the German women's apparel company known for colorful, highly decorated sportswear, died last Thursday in Munich after a long illness.         Mrs. Ley lived in Munich. The company would not disclose her age or cause of death, but she underwent intestinal surgery in recent months.         Mrs. Ley and her husband, Wolfgang Ley, founded Escada in 1979 and built it into an international company that had sales topping $800 million last year. They took the name Escada, which means staircase in Portuguese, from a racehorse, believing it boded well for their future. There are 140 Escada boutiques around the world, including a six-story shop that opened on 57th Street in New York last November. The clothes are also sold in 1,200 specialty and department stores around the world.         In addition to the Escada label, the company also manufactures women's clothing under the Crisca, Laurel, Apriori and Natalie Acatrini labels, produces the Cerruti 1881 women's collection under a licensing agreement and owns a majority percentage of St. John Knits, a California knitwear concern, and Badgley-Mischka, a New York company known for evening wear. The company also makes accessories, luggage, small leather goods and a perfume called Escada. The Leys took Escada public in 1986, retaining 51 percent of the voting stock.         In recent years, Mrs. Ley directed a team of designers who turned out 1,200 styles each season under the Escada label alone. The clothes are divided into color groups, with coordinating shoes, scarfs, gloves and jewelry. New merchandise is shipped to stores every two weeks. Prices are in the upper bracket, with jackets averaging $1,000.         Born in Sweden, Mrs. Ley worked as a model in Stockholm, Vienna and Paris before turning to design. She designed for Mondi, a German sportswear manufacturer, for 10 years before founding Escada with her husband, whom she had married in 1974.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Sven Ley, of Munich, and two children from a previous marriage, Karin Srb, of Munich, and Kristian Srb, of Water Mill, N.Y.       
         Tiki Freeman, who in the early 1970's became one of the first female cantors in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Eastchester, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         Mrs. Freeman died of cancer, said her husband, Joel.         Mrs. Freeman was born in Brooklyn, to Elias Gilner, one of the founders of the Haganah, the defense force raised by Palestinian Jews during the British Mandate, and Violet Sandheim, who had been private secretary to Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization.         Mrs. Freeman's family emigrated to Palestine in the mid-1930's, returning in 1941 as war began to sweep over the area.         Mrs. Freeman graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947. While raising a family, she built a singing career and her repertory ranged from operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan to folk songs and religious music. She was also a stage manager for many productions of Gilbert & Sullivan and other light operas for the Westchester Music Conservatory Opera Company.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Gail Weed Westcott, of Simsbury, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Yonkers, and Ethan, of London and Vienna; a brother, Rabbi Herbert Gilner of Chambersburg, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Barbara Dalton Wainwright, a vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust, died on Tuesday at her home in Ossining, N.Y. She was 44 years old.         She died of complications from cancer, said her husband, Harris E. Wainwright Jr.         Mrs. Wainwright, who had been with Manufacturers since 1976, was vice president for corporate personnel. She was a trustee of Regents College in Albany, which enables adults to pursue college degrees while still working.         In 1982, she was the banking industry representative to the Council to the New York State Board of Regents National Program on Noncollegiate Sponsored Instruction. That body examined the effectiveness of college-level courses for working adults and led to the establishment of Regents College.         She is survived by her husband, Harris, and her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Loring D. Dalton of Naples, Fla.       
         Dr. Joanna Hollenberg Sher, a professor of clinical pathology at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn, died on July 4 at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 59 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Sher died of cancer, said her son, Jonathan.         Dr. Sher, who earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1952 and a medical degree from its school of medicine in 1956, was an authority on neuropathology. She published more than 60 papers and more than 40 abstracts of speeches on the human brain. With Dr. Richard Lectenberg, Dr. Sher was co-editor of a book, "AIDS in the Nervous System," published in 1988 by Churchill-Livingstone.         She joined the faculty of the SUNY Health Science Center as an instructor in 1962 and was named full professor in 1977. In 1987 she was named a distinguished service professor.         Dr. Sher was also chief of the Neuropathology Laboratory at the Kings County Hopsital Center in Brooklyn and an attending physician at other hospitals in New York City.         Dr. Sher, born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was a naturalized United States citizen.         In addition to her son, Jonathan, of Philadelphia, she is survived by her husband, Dr. Norman Sher; a daughter, Katherine, of San Francisco, and a brother, Dr. Robert Hollenberg, of Hamilton, Ontario.       
         Audrey Phipps Holden, a philanthropist long active in New York and Connecticut, died on Sunday at New York Hospital while on a visit to the area.  She was 77 years old and in recent years lived in Hobe Sound, Fla.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Holden, the daughter of Gladys Mills and Henry Carnegie Phipps, was a board member of Phipps Community Development Corporation, a foundation involved in building low-income housing in the New York area. She was a supporter of the New York Zoological Society, Planned Parenthood and Liberation Programs Inc., a drug-rehabilitation project in Stamford, Conn., among other causes.         A collector of English antiques, she was a founding partner of Philip Colleck of London Ltd., an antique dealer in New York.         Mrs. Holden's husband, Philip Dana Holden, an investment banker, died in 1973. She is survived by three daughters, Beatrice Holden Guthrie of Jackson Hole, Wyo., Audrey Holden Charlson Denegre of New Canaan, Conn., and Sonia H. Evers of San Francisco; a son, Michael H., of Greenwich, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Caroline Miller Ray, whose first novel won the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for literature, died on Sunday at her home in Waynesville, N.C. She was 88 years old.         A son, George A. Miller, said the exact cause of death was not known.         Under the name Caroline Miller, Mrs. Ray burst upon the national scene with the publication of the prize-winning book "Lamb in His Bosom," a tale, derived from the history of her extended family, about a backwoods community in pre-Civil War Georgia.  Reviewing it for The New York Times Book Review, Louis Kronenberger wrote that it had "a wonderful freshness about it; not simply the freshness of a new writer, but the freshness of a new world," and that Mrs. Ray's strength was her ability to use words to paint "a wonderful large and vital picture."         At the time, she lived in Baxley, Ga., and was married to her first husband, William D. Miller. The Millers were divorced in 1936. In 1937, she married Clyde H. Ray Jr., a businessman in Waynesville. Mr. Ray died in 1976.         She published her second and final work in 1944, a novel called "Lebanon," which described the beauty of nature and the rhythm of rural life.         In addition to her son George, of Mountain Home, N.C., she is survived by two other sons, William D. Miller Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Clyde H. Ray 3d of Cullowhee, N.C.; a daughter, Caroline Ray Morgan of Annapolis, Md.; 17 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Olga Loeb, a trustee of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center who did volunteer work for more than five decades, died on Sunday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 97 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Loeb managed her gift shop at the hospital on Friday as usual and died at Northern Dutchess Hospital of complications after an asthma attack, said a hospital spokesman. She was on a family visit when she became ill.         She was a native of Vienna who moved to the Bronx in 1911.         As a girl, she collected pennies for a new dispensary that became a forerunner of the hospital that her future husband helped to found in 1927 -- Bronx-Lebanon on the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section. A Buyer for Store Chains         She studied at Syracuse University and then built a successful career buying merchandise for department-store chains. She returned to the Bronx at the age of 40 and married Dr. Martin J. Loeb, a surgeon and philanthropist.         Mrs. Loeb became active in the hospital's Ladies' Auxiliary in 1942 and had been its president since 1953. She also served as an officer or head of various hospital committees as well as the Comprehensive Planning Board for her local health district.         After her husband's death in 1961, Mrs. Loeb persuaded the hospital board to convert part of a waiting room into a gift shop that she would run with a few volunteers. It sells flowers and teddy bears among other things and has raised more than $1 million for the hospital. Mrs. Loeb herself opened the shop every weekday at 7:30 A.M. and closed it at 5 P.M.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         May Rudin, philanthropist and matriarch of one of Manhattan's real-estate dynasties, died yesterday at her East Side home. She was 95 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         A native of New York City, she was one of seven children born to immigrant parents. May Cohen dropped out of high school at the age of 15 and enrolled in a business school to study typing, stenography, bookkeeping and commercial law. She then went to work as a bookkeeper.         In 1923, she married Samuel Rudin, who four years later founded Rudin Management, realtors and builders, whose holdings now comprise dozens of tall buildings. The buildings, assembled over 60 years, were valued at $1.5 billion by analysts two years ago.         When Mr. Rudin died in 1975, his will established the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation, of which Mrs. Rudin was the chairwoman at her death. Well into her 90's, she played an active part in its disbursements, which at last count, in 1990, came to 222 grants totaling $5.3 million. Sponsors of the Marathon         The foundation primarily supported education, social and religious welfare agencies, hospitals and health associations as well as museums and the performing arts. The money was spent mostly in Manhattan, where the Rudins' assets are concentrated.         The Rudins also were the first business sponsors of the New York City Marathon. From its inauguration in 1976 until 1990, May Rudin waited at the finish line each year to present the Samuel Rudin Trophy to the man and woman who broke the tape. Her husband, she noted, was keen on long-distance running well before it became fashionable.         Foundation beneficiaries included St. Vincent's Hospital School of Nursing, AIDS-related programs, Phoenix House and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center to public-school children, Lincoln Center and New York University, where the foundation endowed a chair in the humanities.         Mrs. Rudin is survived by her sons Jack and Lewis, respectively the chairman and the president of the family business, both residents of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Batchelor, a songwriter and radio and television reporter, died on July 23 at South Miami Hospital in Florida. She was 58 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Peter Kory.         Ms. Batchelor began her career as a songwriter, writing songs for Elvis Presley. She also wrote several musicals, including a version of "Tom Jones" for CBS-TV. In 1971, she released an album of women's liberation songs called "Reviving a Dream" on Femme Records, a company she began.         Ms. Batchelor founded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association in 1975, and was its president and executive director for three years. She was an entertainment reporter for ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and a film critic for National Public Radio.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Douglas, of Covelo, Calif.; her parents, Lil and Albert Tarshis of Las Vegas, Nev.; a sister, Lolo Berkoff, and a brother, Stanley Gordon, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
         Pola Nirenska, a noted teacher and choreographer who danced with Mary Wigman, died on Saturday after a fall from the balcony of her apartment in Bethesda, Md. She was 81 years old.         The death was ruled a suicide by the Montgomery County Medical Examiner.         Miss Nirenska was a major force in dance in Washington, as a teacher, as director of a company whose dancers included Liz Lerman and Sharon Wyrrick (later choreographers in their own right), and as a creator of impressively fashioned dances filled with often raw emotion. Her last piece, presented at Dance Place in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims she had known and was called "In Memory of Those I Loved . . . Who Are No More."  Little Early Training         "Her dances are strong and stark, like massive three-dimensional sculpture in volume and weight," George Jackson, a Washington-based dance critic, said after Miss Nirenska's death. "Her figures are larger than life, but with very distinct personalities."         Miss Nirenska, who was born in Warsaw, insisted on a dance career as a child. She had very little early training, but graduated with honors from a music and dance school in Dresden, Germany, run by Wigman, the influential German Expressionist choreographer. Miss Nirenska performed with Wigman's company during its 1932-33 tour of the United States and Germany. She then embarked on a career as a solo dancer, teacher and choreographer, working in Warsaw, Vienna and Italy. In 1934 the International Dance Congress in Vienna awarded Miss Nirenska a first prize for choreography and a second prize for performing.         At the start of World War II, Miss Nirenska, who was Jewish, immigrated to England, where she gave solo recitals, choreographed musicals and entertained the troops. She also worked there with the choreographers Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder and modeled for the sculptor Jacob Epstein.         Miss Nirenska left for the United States in 1949. She studied in New York with leading American modern-dance choreographers and teachers, among them Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon and Louis Horst. She moved to Washington in 1951 and established a career there as a teacher at local ballet and modern-dance schools and at her own studio, and as a highly regarded choreographer with a company of her own.         Her marriage to Count John Ledesma, an actor and military pilot, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Jan Karski.       
         Jean Baer Fensterheim, a writer of personal self-help books and magazine articles aimed especially at women, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Herbert Fensterheim.         A native of Chicago and a 1944 graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Baer scored her first success as an author in 1965 when Macmillan began "Follow Me!," a travel guide for single women looking for a husband abroad. At the time, she was single and the publicity director for Seventeen magazine. The book grew from her experiences during more than a dozen trips to Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.         This was followed in 1968 by "The Single Girl Goes to Town" (Macmillan). Months after its publication, she married Dr. Fensterheim, a clinical psychologist who also became her co-author. Together, they focused on psychological writings.         Their latest book was "Making Life Right When It Feels All Wrong" (Macmillan, 1988).         Outside the genre, Ms. Baer wrote "The Self-Chosen" (Arbor House, 1982), a book about what she called "the world of the Jewish elite" in the United States since World War II.         She was the secretary of the Overseas Press Club and served on its board of directors.         Ms. Baer is survived, in addition to Dr. Fensterheim, by a sister, Carol Norr of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, Robert Baer of Woodstock, N.Y.       
         Alice Bennett Dunnington, a Government intelligence official during World War II, died on Monday at Beaumont at Bryn Mawr, a retirement home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 87 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Rodger McKinney, director of the Chadwick Funeral Home in Ardmore, Pa.         During the war years Mrs. Dunnington, a 1925 graduate of Smith College, was a policy planner for the Office of Strategic Services, precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. As secretary to the service's policy planning committee, she reported to Col. Edward Buxton, Deputy Director of the O.S.S.         Mrs. Dunnington's husband, Walter, died in 1971. She is survived by three daughters, Michelle Osborn of Haverford, Pa., and Washington, Patricia Pynchon of New York and Alexandra Whalen Sears of Lima, Peru; a stepson, Walter G. Dunnington Jr. of New York and Gladstone, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Allen D. Ohstrom of The Plains, Va.; eight grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.         Correction:  July 10, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Alice Bennett Dunnington, a Government intelligence officer in World War II, identified a daughter incorrectly. She is Alexandra Whelen Sears of Lima, Peru.       
         Irene Silva de Santolalla, a Peruvian educator and author who in 1956 became the first woman in the country to be elected senator, died on Thursday at her home in Lima, the capital. She was 90 years old.         Her family said yesterday that she died after a long illness. Further details were not available.         Mrs. Santolalla was honored by many governments for her writing on children and adolescents and her efforts to raise awareness of the importance of family relations. The Union of American Women, a private group based in Washington with chapters in most Latin American countries, named her its Woman of the Americas in 1956.         The Peruvian Government honored her with its highest award, the Order of the Sun, 10 years ago.         Elected to the Senate in 1956, she served for six years and won praise as the author of a law on family education enacted in Peru in 1957.         Mrs. Santolalla also founded Government institutes for training teachers in Peruvian cities and was a sought-after lecturer throughout Europe and Latin America on family education and child development.         She wrote several books on the conditions faced by children and adolescents and served as an adviser to the United Nations and two of its agencies, Unesco and Unicef.         She is survived by her husband of 71 years, Fausto Santolalla Bernal, 101 years old; two daughters, Irene Santolalla Silva and Maria Teresa Santolalla Silva, and a son, Javier Santolalla Silva, all of Lima; nine grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Barbara Morgan, the photographer whose portraits of Martha Graham captured the essence of that choreographer's art, died on Monday night at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 92 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Morgan was best known for her photographs of American modern dancers, among them Graham, Jose Limon, Doris Humphrey, Pearl Primus, Charles Weidman, Erick Hawkins and Merce Cunningham. Her dance photographs were never intended for publicity or documentation. Instead, she said in a 1980 interview, they were metaphors, created to catch the symbolic image that epitomized the dance or dancer.         Like Graham, she believed that gestures could express profound emotional truths. Her photographs revealed, Graham wrote in 1980, "the inner landscape that is a dancer's world." Reluctant Beginnings         She said one of her earliest influences was her father's suggestion that his 5-year-old daughter "think of everything in the world as dancing atoms." But she came to photography reluctantly and then, accidentally, to dance.         Her husband, Willard D. Morgan, talked her into trying photography, although she resisted at first, calling it journalism rather than art. Mr. Morgan, whom she married in 1925 and who died in 1967, was a photojournalist who made the Leica camera popular. He was the first photography editor of Life magazine and the first director of the photography division at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.         In 1935, soon after Mrs. Morgan had begun to photograph, she saw Graham's "Primitive Mysteries" and was drawn to its treatment of ritual in the American Southwest. The two women began six years of intense collaboration on a book, "Martha Graham: 16 Dances in Photographs," which was a centerpiece of both careers and which is considered the quintessential statement on how to look at dance and record it. The two women remained lifelong friends.         After 1945, Mrs. Morgan concentrated on photographing children, trees and plants, and on designing photomontages and light drawings. Her correspondence with William Carlos Williams, Margaret Mead, Joseph Campbell and Edward Weston, an early photographic influence, is considered a rich historical resource.         Among Mrs. Morgan's other books are "Summer's Children," "Barbara Morgan" and "Barbara Morgan Photomontage," all published by Morgan & Morgan of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Her photographs were exhibited in solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution and other museums and galleries in the United States and Europe.         She is survived by her sons, Lloyd, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Douglas, of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Edith R. Peterson, a medical researcher into cell cultures at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Saturday at Horton Memorial Hospital in Middletown, N.Y. She was 78 years old and had moved to Middletown two years ago from the Bronx.         She died of a stroke, said Art Oshins, a spokesman at Albert Einstein.         Ms. Peterson, who was born in Brooklyn, had been associated with the college since 1966. She was known for several innovations in her specialty, organotypic cultures -- cultures typical of an organ -- of nerve and muscle tissues.         The college reported that one important contribution led to the recognition that myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve cells, can be grown in test tubes. The finding, which she made in 1948, aided multiple-sclerosis research, since the destruction of myelin causes that disease, the college said.         Ms. Peterson graduated from Barnard College in 1937 with a major in zoology, and earned an M.A. in that discipline at Columbia University two years later.         Ms. Peterson is survived by her husband, Charles; a son, Wesley; a daughter, Ronnie, and three grandchildren, all of Middletown.       
         Dr. Dorothy Richardson Jones, an author and professor emeritus of English at Queens College died on Friday at Rutland (Vt.) Regional Medical Center.

         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988.

         Virginia Sale, a character actress whose career in theater, film, radio and television spanned more than four decades, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 93 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Miss Sale was best known for her work in Hollywood, where by her count she played more than 300 supporting roles in films, beginning with silent comedies in 1927 and concluding with "Slither" in 1970.         She also appeared for eight years in the radio serial "Those We Love," and she wrote and starred in "The Wrens' Nest," one of television's first family comedies, which was broadcast by ABC in 1949. She was frequently seen on the Garry Moore and Kate Smith shows and in other television comedies, including "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres."         Miss Sale also won acclaim for her one-woman show, "Americana Sketches," in which she drew upon her upbringing in Urbana, Ill., to explore the foibles and humor of small town-America.         Miss Sale attended the University of Illinois for two years and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her films included the 1930 "Moby Dick," with John Barrymore, and a string of Westerns, including "Badman's Territory" and "Trail Street," with Randolph Scott.         Miss Sale's husband, Sam Wren, an actor and director, died in Hollywood in 1962.         She is survived by a daughter, Virginia Wren Moore of Lake Forest, Ill., and a son, Christopher S.

         Lillian Libman, a manager, press agent and personal representative for many leading instrumentalists, opera singers and dancers, died on Monday at her sister's home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said her sister Bernice Lewis.         From the early 1950's, when she established Lillian Libman Associates, Miss Libman represented Jan Peerce, George London, Roberta Peters, Peter Schickele, Rudolf Nureyev and many other artists. She also represented the Mannes School of Music, the Aspen Music Festival and other institutions.         Miss Libman was a personal representative for Stravinsky. Her 1972 book about the composer, "And Music at the Close: Stravinsky's Last Years," created a controversy in the music world by challenging previously published portraits of the artist. In a front-page article in The New York Times, Donal Henahan said the book called into question "Stravinsky's character, his interest in new music, his appetite for prolonging feuds with colleagues and critics, and his brilliance as a writer and polemicist." An Associate of Sol Hurok         She was born in Boston. A graduate of Wellesley College, she studied archeology in Greece and the Middle East under a Rockefeller grant. Her interests turned to the performing arts in 1952.         She was associated with the impresario Sol Hurok, acting as the press representative for many of his foreign attractions. She later became the executive producer of classical attractions for the Nederlander Organization. In 1986 she joined International Creative Management Artists as a consultant.         Miss Libman's husband, Harry A. Woodward, died in 1975.         In addition to Mrs. Lewis, she is survived by another sister, Anna Shore, of Lakeville, Mass.

         Marian A. Granowitz, a former vice chairwoman of the Republican State and Westchester County Committees, died on Thursday at Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 78 years old and a lifelong resident of Port Chester, N.Y.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         Mrs. Granowitz's unpaid party work was a labor of love. Moving steadily up the ladder of leadership in the Westchester organization in the 1970's and 1980's, she served as its vice chairwoman, then regional vice chairwoman to coordinate Republican activities in five counties. She finally became a state vice chairwoman.         Born in Port Chester, she graduated from public high school and went to work for B. Altman's White Plains store.

         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Harriet W. Sheridan, former undergraduate dean at Brown University, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 67 years old and lived in Barrington, R.I.         The cause of death was cancer, said Don DeMaio, a Brown spokesman.         Professor Sheridan was hired as dean at Brown in 1979 and remained in the post until 1987, when she resigned to return to her longtime career, the teaching of English. She later founded the Center for the Advancement of College Teaching at the university and was noted for her course on literature and medicine, which proved popular with many medical students.         She had arrived at Brown from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she had spent 26 years and had served at various times as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, chairwoman of the English department and faculty chairwoman. She was also Carleton's acting president from January to August of 1977, succeeding Howard Swearer, who had resigned to become president at Brown.         A native of Manhattan, she received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from Smith College in 1945 and a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1950.         Professor Sheridan was chairwoman of the American Association for Higher Education and a member of many educational groups, including the American Council on Education's Commission on Women in Higher Education. She was a former director of the Association of American Colleges and a former member of the Commission on Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.         She is survived by her husband, Philip; two daughters, Alison Buffum of Narrangansett, R.I., and Roo Sheridan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
         Ruth Nelson, an actress in the legendary Group Theater that transformed American acting and whose career on stage, film and television spanned nearly 70 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer complicated by a stroke and pneumonia, her family said.         Ms. Nelson began acting in the early 1920's and last appeared onstage in "Uncle Vanya" in New York last year and on film in the 1990 movie "Awakenings."         During the 1930's she was a charter member of the Group, which gave birth to modern American acting. The Group infused its work with new psychological insights, naturalistic style and political content. It produced many top actors, directors and acting teachers, including Lee J. Cobb, Morris Carnovsky, John Garfield, Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Stella Adler and Lee Strasburg, and led to new techniques, including the Method. 'They Couldn't Applaud Any More'         In a great moment of theater history, Ms. Nelson was the taxicab driver's wife in the original cast of Clifford Odets' "Waiting for Lefty." On opening night in 1935, the audience gave an extraordinary 45-minute ovation.         "When they couldn't applaud any more, they stomped their feet," she later recalled. "All I could think was, 'My God, they're going to bring the balcony down!' It was terrible, it was so beautiful."         For 33 years she was married to John Cromwell, founder of the Screen Directors Guild. Among his directing credits were "Of Human Bondage," in which Miss Nelson played the wife, "Algiers," "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" and "The Goddess."         But when Mr. Cromwell was accused of Communism in the 1950's -- a charge he denied in Congressional testimony -- his career went into a blacklisted eclipse. At the time, Ms. Nelson was offered a New York stage role as a wife in what turned out to be a monumental play, "Death of a Salesman." She turned it down to stay in Los Angeles to help her husband through his ordeal.         Mr. Cromwell died in 1979. A Nun's Encouragement         Born in Flint, Mich., Ms. Nelson grew up on the vaudeville circuit with her mother, Eva Mudge, a noted quick-change artist. Then she went to Los Angeles to study at a Roman Catholic school. Although her mother had discouraged Ms. Nelson from a show business career, a nun saw her potential and nudged her to Broadway.         Her stage performances won critical praise. Her film debut came in 1944 in four movies, and she made nine more in the next four years. Her later films included Robert Altman's "3 Women" and "Wedding" in the 1970's.         In a 1966 review in The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote that her portrayal of Mrs. Antrobus in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth" was "very easily the best" he had seen. "Miss Nelson misses no nuance of reality that the part offers, and in one moment -- when she mourns her murdered son Abel -- she touches true elegy," he wrote.         Her first marriage, to actor William Challee, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two sisters, Linda Stack of Darien, Conn., and Gay Samuelson of Los Angeles; a stepson, James Cromwell of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.

         Mary Wells Ashworth, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, died on Saturday at the Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Va. She was 89 years old and lived in Richmond.         Mrs. Ashworth died of a ruptured aorta, said her son, Osbourne Orlando Ashworth Jr. of Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Ashworth grew up in Florida and moved to Virginia with her family as a teen-ager. She graduated from Hollins College in Hollins, Va., in 1924, and later served on the college's board.         For many years, Mrs. Ashworth was a research associate of the historian Douglas Southall Freeman, the author of a multi-volume biography of George Washington. After Professor Freeman died in 1953, she and another research associate, John A. Carroll, wrote the seventh and final volume of Freeman's authoritative "George Washington, a Biography" published by Scribner's in 1957. The entire work won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1958 and Columbia University's Loubat Prize the same year.         Mrs. Ashworth also contributed to the World Book Encyclopedia and to the compendium "Notable American Women 1607-1950."         Mrs. Ashworth's husband, Dr. Osbourne O. Ashworth, a physician, died in 1945. In addition to her son Osbourne, Mrs. Ashworth is survived by another son, Dr. John Sheriden Ashworth of Richmond.       
         Amelia Lobsenz, a public-relations executive who ran her own firm in Manhattan for the last 36 years, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in Old Brookville, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Kay Abrahams.         A native of Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Lobsenz graduated from Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., and became one of the first women to rise into the executive ranks of her profession.         She formed Lobsenz Public Relations in 1956; it became Lobsenz-Stevens Inc. in 1975. At the time of her death she was board chairwoman and chief executive of the firm, which counts American Home Products, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Procter & Gamble among its clients.         Besides her daughter, a Manhattan resident, Ms. Lobsenz is survived by her husband, Dr. Harry Abrahams; a son, Michael Lobsenz of Boyds, Md., and three grandchildren.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Jenkins Kinnear, a former director of the Garden Club of America, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Ala. She was 94 years old and lived in Birmingham.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Polly Lincoln.         Mrs. Kinnear was a horticultural and artistic judge and a director of the Garden Club of America from 1977 to 1979, when she received the club's Zone Horticultural Award. A native of Butler, Pa., she graduated from Allegheny College in 1920.         Mrs. Kinnear's husband, James W. Kinnear Jr., a vice president of United States Steel, now the USX Corporation, died in 1990. She is survived by two sons, James W. 3d, of Greenwich, Conn., president and chief executive officer of Texaco Inc., and Peter, of Birmingham; a daughter, Polly Lincoln of West Hartford, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Judith N. Shklar, a professor of government at Harvard University, died Wednesday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 63 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of a heart attack, said Ariadne Valsamis, a Harvard University spokeswoman.         Professor Shklar specialized in 18th, 19th, and 20th century political and intellectual theory. From 1989 to 1990 she was president of the American Political Science Association, the first woman to head the nation's largest professional organization of political scientists.         In 1984 she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for exceptionally talented individuals.         In 1985 she was awarded the teaching prize of the Harvard University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Its citation described her as "demanding, rewarding, forthright, fair, and reasonable, a model of intellectual and human qualities rarely combined."         Born in Riga, Latvia, Professor Shklar emigrated with her family first to Sweden and then in 1941 to Canada. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill University and a doctorate in 1955 from Radcliffe College. She taught at Harvard since 1956.         Professor Shklar is survived by her husband, Gerald Shklar, a professor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine; two sons, David, of Cambridge, and Michael, of Leminister, N.H., and a daughter, Ruth, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Bernice Gera, the first female umpire in professional baseball, died of kidney cancer Wednesday in Memorial Hospital West in Pembroke Pines, Fla. She was 61 years old.         In 1972, Mrs. Gera, who fought in courtrooms for the preceding five years to achieve her goal, gained national attention when she umpired a Class A minor league game between the Geneva Rangers and the Auburn Phillies of the New York-Penn League.         Mrs. Gera resigned after the game, saying she became disenchanted with umpiring when the other umpires refused to cooperate with her on the field.         "Bernice would always say, 'I could beat them in the courts, but I can't beat them on the field,' " Steve Gera, her husband, said. No woman has ever umpired in the major leagues.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Gera is survived by two brothers and two sisters.       
         Dorothy Disney MacKaye, who chronicled marital woes and dispensed advice for 30 years through a column in The Ladies' Home Journal, "Can This Marriage Be Saved?", died on Saturday at her summer home in Guilford, Conn. She was 88 years old and lived in Guilford and Washington.         She died of a heart attack, said her son, William R. MacKaye of Washington.         Mrs. MacKaye, who wrote under the byline Dorothy Cameron Disney, was something of a pioneer both as an advice columnist and a marriage counselor, and for generations of readers her column -- entertaining, occasionally titillating, sometimes a little pedantic -- served as a spyglass into the lives of anonymous strangers.         The column, which first appeared in January 1953, continues today. In Mrs. MacKaye's hands it was devoted each month to the travails of a married couple. Based on interviews and then written largely in dialogue, as if in the voices of the troubled partners, the columns dealt with issues like jealousy, infidelity, money problems and, increasingly as time went on and moral strictures relaxed, sexual problems.         "The columns seem to represent a chronicle of the many changes in the institution of marriage -- and the fascination it holds," Mrs. MacKaye said in a retrospective essay written for the 100th anniversary issue of The Ladies' Home Journal in January 1984. Looking back on her three decades as a columnist, she concluded that of all marital problems, "the single greatest pitfall of all times" is the inability of husband and wife to communicate. " 'He (or she) never listens' is universal," she wrote.         By the time she began her career as a columnist, she was the author of nine mystery novels, and she believed she was successful as a columnist, her son said in an interview, because of her training as a storyteller. Her technique, he said, was to take her prospective subject couple out to dinner to prime and cajole them and then afterward to speak with them separately. She would also interview their marriage counselor.         In the column, the names were never divulged and identifying details were not provided. "She would always tell the couples that unless they told their friends they'd never be recognized," her son said. "Those people who told their friends were invariably recognized -- and embarrassed."         In the beginning, the column was a collaboration between Mrs. MacKaye and Dr. Paul Popenoe, the founder of the American Institute of Family Relations, a marriage counseling agency in Hollywood. Dr. Popenoe put her in touch with his patients, who then became her subjects. Later on, as the column became more well known, Mrs. MacKaye made it entirely her own, calling on counseling agencies across the country for source material.         Mrs. MacKaye was born in 1904 in Atoka, Indian Territory, part of what became the State of Oklahoma in 1907, and grew up in Muskogee. Her father, Loren G. Disney, was a lawyer and a local political figure. She attended several colleges, including George Washington University and Barnard College, but never graduated. Her son said her explanation for this was that she refused to take any science courses.         Mrs. MacKaye's marriage to Milton MacKaye, a magazine writer, endured for 50 years until his death in 1979.         In her addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter-in-law, Mary Anne MacKaye, and five grandchildren.       
         Katherine Swan Ginsburg, a doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and an instructor at the Harvard Medical School, died Friday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 34 years old and lived in Newton Centre, Mass.         The cause of death was cancer, her husband, Dr. Geoffrey Ginsburg, said.         Dr. Ginsburg, a native of Rochester, Minn., was a research fellow in rheumatology at Brigham and Women's from 1988 until this year, when she was appointed to the staff there and to the medical school faculty.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, Jeremy Swan, and stepmother, Rona Swan, both of Beverly Hills, Calif.; her mother, Pamela Swan of Long Beach, Calif.; four sisters, Elizabeth Condit of Gainesville, Fla., Caroline Swan of Los Angeles and Eleanor Donohue and Geraldine Swan, both of Long Beach; two brothers, Jeremy Swan of Studio City, Calif., and Gordon Swan of Los Angeles.       
         Eleanor H. Raynolds, an executive search consultant who was honored by the Queen of England for her work for the British-American Chamber of Commerce, died on Tuesday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 55 years old and lived in Stamford.         The cause of her death was a massive staphylococcus infection, said Penny Paul Mooney, an associate at Ward Howell, the executive search firm where she was a partner. She said the cause of the infection has not been determined.         Mrs. Raynolds joined Ward Howell in 1985. Founder of Peer Group         During the early 1980's, she served consecutive terms as president of the British-American Chamber of Commerce, for which she was made a Commander of the British Empire. She was also a founder of the Peer Group, a national association of women in management and the arts, and served as a director of the New York Mission Society, the Women's Economic Round table and Mary Baldwin College.         Together with her husband, John F. Raynolds 3d, former president of Outward Bound USA, she wrote "Beyond Success -- How Volunteer Service Can Help You Begin Making a Life Insead of Just a Living."         Mrs. Raynolds, who trekked in the Himalayas and the Andes and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had just returned from a horse-riding trip in Utah when she died.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, a son, Jayson Kuhn of Silver Spring, Md., and a daughter, Jennifer Irwin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and by two grandchildren.       
         Sayedah Khadijah Faisal, a founder of Brooklyn's first mosque who was known to hundreds of Muslims as Mother Khadijah, died Saturday at her home at the mosque in Brooklyn Heights. She was 93 years old.         Officials of the mosque, the Islamic Mission of America, said she died after a long illness, which they did not specify.         Mother Khadijah founded the mosque in 1939 with her husband, Sheik Daoud Ahmed Faisal, who served as its imam, or spiritual leader, until his death in 1980.         She and her husband worked to bring immigrant Muslims and new American converts to the faith together in one mosque. The success of their effort was evident at her funeral there yesterday, where Muslims from Pakistan and Morocco prayed shoulder to shoulder with American black converts. The mosque is situated in a former mansion at 143 State Street in Brooklyn Heights.         During noon prayers that preceded the funeral, which was attended by several hundred people, the plain pine coffin was kept in the rear of the mosque amid a large group of women who had come to mourn. Afterward, the men of the mosque brought the casket forward for a brief service in Arabic that was centered on the belief that the deceased was merely passing on to another life.         Belquis Abdur Raheem, a teacher at an Islamic elementary school, brought seven of her pupils to the funeral. "It is important for them to see an important part of Islamic history pass on," she said. "All of these children and their parents grew up with Mother Khadijah being known to them as a focal point of Islam."         In addition to being a founder of the mosque, Mother Khadijah served as its secretary and treasurer and led its Muslim Ladies Cultural Society.         For many years, the mosque was the only one in Brooklyn and, as a result, her leadership was broader than Brooklyn Heights. She also traveled around the country with her husband, addressing women's groups on Islam.         Mother Khadijah, who was born in Bermuda, is survived by her second husband, Imam Omar Bey, and by several nieces and nephews in Bermuda.       
         Anne G. Wilder, who led the expansion of Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit developmental theater in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wilder joined the Playwrights Horizons board in 1976 and was its chairwoman for the last 11 years. She helped raise money and guide the purchase of its building at 416 West 42d Street, which houses two theaters and administrative offices.         The organization sponsored many productions, some of which moved to Off Broadway, including Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," Jonathan Reynolds's "Geniuses" and Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic."         Among the writers, composers and lyricists supported by Playwrights Horizons have been Ted Tally, A. R. Gurney, Alfred Uhry, James Lapine, William Finn and Albert Innaurato.         Mrs. Wilder also produced two Off Broadway shows that received critical and popular note: "A . . . My Name Is Alice," a musical revue, and a trilogy of one-act plays, "Win/Lose/Draw."         Before her involvement in the theater, Mrs. Wilder was a volunteer, lecturer, trainer and board member of the New York City School Volunteer program.         She was born in Bayonne, N.J., and grew up in Englewood, N.J. She graduated from Connecticut College in 1950.         She is survived by her husband, Robert C. Wilder; a daughter, Rachel W. Smeragliuolo of Baltimore; two sons, Clinton D., of San Francisco, and Robert D., of Washington; a sister, Doris Gould of Atlanta, and a granddaughter.       
         Louise Field Cooper, a novelist and short-story writer, died last Friday at her home in Woodbridge, Conn. She was 87 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, said her son Peter Brintnall Cooper.         Mrs. Cooper was born in Hartford and graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. Her short stories appeared frequently in The New Yorker from 1938 to 1962. Her 10 novels included "The Lighted Box" (1942), "Summer Stranger" (1947) and "The Boys From Sharon" (1950). "Love and Admiration," a collection of her short stories, was published in 1944.         In her fiction, Mrs. Cooper stayed close to home, concocting a delicate social satire from characters and settings familiar to her. "All I write about are the things I know myself, and I've never had very much happen to me," she once said in an interview. Eudora Welty wrote that "her touch is as light as it is sure, and as revealing as it is quiet."         Mrs. Cooper's husband, James Wayne Cooper, a senior partner of the New Haven law firm of Tyler, Cooper & Alcorn, died in 1989.         In addition to her son Peter, of Woodbridge, she is survived by another son, James Nicoll Cooper of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Field McIntyre of London; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Ann F. Friedlaender, an economist who was the first woman to become an academic dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 54 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.         She died of cancer, said Charles Ball, an M.I.T. spokesman.         Professor Friedlaender, who held a joint professorship in economics and civil engineering, was dean of M.I.T.'s School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1984 to 1990. In 1983 she was named chairwoman of the economics department.         She was also a director of the Rand Corporation and of Conrail.         Professor Friedlaender is survived by her husband, Stephen Friedlaender; two sons, Lucas Friedlaender and Nathaniel Friedlaender, both of Newton, and a brother, Alexander L. Fetter, of Palo Alto, Calif.       
         Shirley Booth, an actress whose warmth and versatility brought her acclaim on stage, screen and television, died on Friday at her home in North Chatham, Mass. She was 94 years old.         She died after a brief illness, said David Hunt of the Nickerson Funeral Home in Chatham, who announced her death yesterday.         Miss Booth was celebrated for never giving a bad performance. She portrayed many quick-witted women with acerbic tongues, but gained her greatest recognition for playing an ingratiating but drab, garrulous housewife clinging to wistful illusions in "Come Back, Little Sheba."         In "Sheba," she captivated audiences as Lola Delaney opposite Sidney Blackmer in William Inge's 1950 Broadway play, and then co-starred with Burt Lancaster in the 1952 movie version. Miss Booth's portrayals of a woman struggling to cope with her husband's alcoholism and their barren life together garnered every dramatic award, including a Tony and an Oscar.  'I Like My Work'         In a lighter vein, on television, the actress played the title role of an irrepressible maid on "Hazel" from 1961 to 1966, for which she received two Emmys. When associates deplored her doing the sitcom as demeaning her talents, she gently took issue with them. "Why not enjoy Hazel's success?" she said to a colleague. "I'm as pleased as I can be. I like my work."         She said the only other work she might enjoy as much as acting was interior decorating. For many years, she enjoyed remodeling her Manhattan apartment and 1810 cottage in Cape Cod, Mass.         In 1973, Miss Booth starred in a second television sitcom as a perky widow in "A Touch of Grace." Thirty years earlier, on radio, she had been a wisecracking cashier, Miss Duffy, on "Duffy's Tavern."  In Praise of Talents         She learned her craft by performing in 600 plays in stock companies before she appeared in some 40 plays on Broadway and in a few movies. On the stage she was a gangster's moll in "Three Men on a Horse" (1935), an inquisitive photographer in "The Philadelphia Story" (1939), a caustic writer in "My Sister Eileen" (1940), an anti-fascist teacher in "Tomorrow the World" (1943) and an exuberant gossip columnist in "Hollywood Pinafore" (1945).         Also on Broadway, Miss Booth was an urbane secretary in "Goodbye My Fancy" (1948), a freewheeling aunt in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1951), a romantic tourist in "The Time of the Cuckoo" (1952) and an ingratiating researcher in "The Desk Set" (1955).         Her films included "About Mrs. Leslie" (1954), "Hot Spell" (1958) and Thornton Wilder's "Matchmaker" (1958).         In comedies and musicals as well as dramas, reviews of her performances resembled love letters. The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson, reviewing a 1954 Broadway musical, "By the Beautiful Sea," wrote that Miss Booth's acting "radiates all through a large theater and draws an audience close together."         "The stage begins to glow the moment she steps on it and the audience melts, like a crowd of children whose imagination has been captured by someone they trust," he continued. "No one else in the theater has made native decency so human, so triumphant and so captivating."         The actress was born in Manhattan to the former Virginia Wright and Albert J. Ford, a business executive. The young Thelma Booth Ford attended public schools in Brooklyn and Hartford, and dropped out at 14 to seek a stage career, despite angry opposition by her father.         She made her first professional appearance in 1921 in Hartford in a thriller, "The Cat and the Canary," and appeared in stock theater in New Haven for more than a year, under the name Shirley Booth. She made her Broadway debut in "Hell's Bells" in 1925, along with another newcomer, Humphrey Bogart, and then interspersed stock engagements with short-lived Broadway plays for a decade.  For Room and Breakfast         She gained notice in New York by appearing in skits by Dorothy Parker at the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel in return for a room and breakfast. The performances led George Abbott, the producer and playwright, to give her the ingenue's role in "Three Men on a Horse." The comedy's two-year run elevated her from stock and led Mr. Abbott to remark, "I have worked with more actresses than I can count, and to me Shirley is easily tops."         Appraising her own views on acting, Miss Booth said: "I'm lucky. I play characters, not types. I don't care what the part is as long as it's a person I'm interested in, someone I want to introduce to people."         In an interview in 1971, she said: "I'd rather have affection than admiration. Affection is warmer and it lasts longer. I love a good critic. I don't care if he pans me, if he does it elegantly."         Miss Booth was married to Ed Gardner, the Archie of "Duffy's Tavern," from 1929 until their divorce in 1942. Her second husband, William H. Baker Jr., an artist and farmer, died of heart disease in 1951.         She is survived by a sister, Jean Coe of Los Angeles.       
         Natalie deWolf Paine, a television production administrator at CBS News and at the Columbia University Seminars on Media and Society, died on Wednesday. She was 62 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.         Mrs. Paine's death was reported by her husband, Kenneth Paine, who said she died of cancer at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.         Mrs. Paine joined CBS News as a staff administrator in 1951 and served as staff administrator for the "See It Now" and "CBS Reports" programs, with Edward R. Murrow reporting and Fred W. Friendly producing.         Mr. Friendly described Mrs. Paine yesterday as "a central link, our gyroscope" in coordinating production and information gathering.         She resigned from CBS in 1964 to raise a family. In 1982 she rejoined Mr. Friendly, who was directing Columbia University's seminars on the media and society and helped to produce more than 600 of them.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Jenifer, of Boston; two stepdaughters, Emily Paine of Los Angeles and Rachel Wilson of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Janet Viertel, an underwater photographer, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco. She was 77 years old and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Newark, she attended public schools and the School of Dramatic Art, New York University. She married Joseph Viertel and lived in Stamford, Conn., where she took part in civic activities. She became water resources chairman of the Connecticut State Board of the League of Women Voters, which awakened her interest in the coastal waters and oceans.         At the age of 50, when her children had grown up, she decided to become an underwater photographer, learned to dive and moved to St. Croix with her husband. The results were three books published by Grosset & Dunlap: "Undersea Gardens of the Virgin Islands" (1969); "Blue Planet, the Ecology of the Oceans" (1973), intended for high-school students, and "Underwater Holidays" (1978), a diving-and-snorkeling guide.         Her work was exhibited in one-woman shows at the Eastman Kodak galleries and at Grand Central Terminal in New York and at colleges and galleries around the country. She showed her work on television talk shows.         She always maintained a sense of humor about her work. Asked by a television interviewer which she enjoyed more, the scuba diving or photography, she replied: "The part I like best is when I come back to the surface and have a gin and tonic."         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Viertel is survived by a daughter, Alice Krieger of Manhattan; two sons, Tom of Manhattan, and Jack of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a sister, Joy Golden of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party. But when you've read the stories, your next party might may seem to you as if Laurie Colwin had written it."         Ms. Colwin's four novels were "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 1990), "Family Happiness" (Knopf, 1982), "Happy All the Time" (Knopf, 1978) and "Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object" (Viking, 1975). A Focus on Food         Her three collections of short stories were "Another Marvelous Thing" (Knopf, 1986), "The Lone Pilgrim" (Knopf, 1981) and "Passage and Affect" (Viking, 1974). Some of her work was adapted for stage and television.         She also worked as a translator for Isaac Bashevis Singer and wrote for The New Yorker, Mademoiselle and Redbook.         In 1987 Ms. Colwin won a Guggenheim fellowship.         Food was also a focus of her life.  During the campus uprisings at Columbia University in 1968, she cooked forstudent protesters occupying buildings. Later she was a volunteer and a cook for the Coalition for the Homeless and the Antonio Olivieri Shelter for Homeless Women.         She was also a food columnist for Gourmet magazine and wrote two volumes of essays and recipes, "Home Cooking" (Knopf, 1988) and "More Home Cooking" (HarperCollins, 1990).         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton.  Then she began trying her own hand at writing and sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of the Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.       
         Louise Natale Wagner, a coloratura soprano who was a frequent soloist in choral performances in the 1950's and 60's, died on Sunday at Rahway Hospital in Rahway, N.J. She was 74 years old and lived in Rahway.         She died of a heart attack, said a spokesman for the Lehrer-Gibilisco Funeral Home.         Mrs. Wagner, who performed under her maiden name, Louise Natale, was born in Elizabeth, N.J. In the 1950's, she toured nationally as a soloist with the Robert Shaw Chorale and performed with Mr. Shaw at Carnegie Hall.         She also sang with the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the NBC Symphony. In 1976, Mrs. Wagner founded the Light Opera Theater of New Jersey.         Her husband, John O. Wagner, died in 1974.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor De Francesco of New Port Richie, Fla., and Edith Natale of Linden, N.J., and a brother, John Natale of Caldwell, N.J.       
         Laurie E. Colwin, a novelist and writer of short stories on modern urban romance and life, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 48 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Colwin's writing won praise for its intelligence, wit and style. Critics said she displayed a keen ear and eye for the ways of the middle- and upper-class New York characters she portrayed. Her stories were noted for refreshingly happy endings in tales of love, both in and outside of marriage.         A New York Times review said she "uses her elegant, delicately colored prose to explore the effects of a relationship on a psyche." The Village Voice said her work "conjures up Manet's picnic painting as it might be reinterpreted by Koren," the cartoonist.         Judith Rascoe said in Rolling Stone: "I can't give you plot summaries that you can retell at your next party.

She has one more book of fiction, "A Big Storm Knocked It Over," also being published by HarperCollins.         Born in Manhattan, Ms. Colwin grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., Chicago and Philadelphia. She attended Bard College and Columbia University.         She worked for literary agents and on publishers' editorial staffs at Viking, Putnam, Pantheon and Dutton. She began trying her own hand at writing and, at the age of 25, sold her first story to The New Yorker.         Surviving are her husband of nine years, Juris Jurjevics, the editor in chief of The Soho Press, and the couple's daughter, Rosa Audrey. She is also survived by her mother, Estelle Snellenberg, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Leslie Friedman, of Philadelphia.       
         Patricia B. Ewell, who acted in Broadway plays in the 1920's, 30's and 40's, died on Sunday at her home in Dennis, Mass. She was 93 years old.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Performing under her stage name, Patricia Barclay, Mrs. Ewell started her career with the Theater Guild. She appeared in plays with Claude Rains and Spencer Tracy, among others, and she also worked in regional theaters across the country.         The New York Sun praised "her simplicity, her natural beauty and her extraordinary talent." In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described her acting as "delightful."         Mrs. Ewell, whose maiden name was Riordan, was born in Manhattan.         Her marriage to Hardwick Nevin, a playwright, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband of 56 years, Richard Ewell, a retired actor.       
         Maggie Comer Robinson, whose efforts to overcome her own impoverished background and inspire her children to pursue higher education were recounted in a biography and in a television documentary, died Monday at St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, Ind. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Robinson died of septicemia, a blood infection, said a son, Dr. James P. Comer of North Haven, Conn.         Her five children earned a total of 13 undergraduate and graduate degrees, and all seven of her grandchildren are college graduates.         It was Dr. Comer's recounting of his mother's life in "Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family," published by New American Library in 1988, that brought her to the nation's attention. PBS Documentary         Her story was retold in a Public Broadcasting Service documentary, "The Legacy of Maggie's American Dream," which was first broadcast last month.         Mrs. Robinson, who was born in Woodland, Miss., and reared in Memphis, moved to East Chicago in 1920. She met her first husband, Hugh Comer, in the New Hope Zion Church, where he was a deacon. He died in 1955, and she later married Ervin Robinson of East Chicago. Mr. Robinson died in 1985.         She was a member of the Mothers Board of the New Ebenezer Baptist Church and a vice president of the Washington High School P.T.A. Among the many honors she received after her biography was published was an honorary doctorate awarded last year by Wheelock College in Boston.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Robinson is survived by two other sons, Dr. Norman D. Comer and Dr. Charles Comer, both of East Chicago; two daughters, Louise Comer of Eufala, Ala., and Thelma C. Morris of Gary, Ind.; two sisters, Susie Cossey and Carrie Watkins, both of East Chicago; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Sable, a longtime civic leader who fostered voter participation and recruited public officials and business leaders to debate New York City's problems and future, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         For four decades Mrs. Sable was a League of Women Voters volunteer and officer. She was the economic development director of its New York chapter and was also on the national board.         She focused on the city's government structure, financing and management, as well as its economy. In the city and state fiscal crises in the 1970's, she convened seminars for officials and others to learn about and discuss finances and charter reform.         "Edith's meetings were one of the best sources of background information," said Elizabeth Cooke, then a municipal union lobbyist and now president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. "Personal and political agendas were pretty much put aside, and thoughtful people struggled with difficult issues." Published 'They Represent You'         Mrs. Sable's later conferences examined city management in 1979, the capital budget process in 1981, infrastructure in 1983, public authorities in 1985 and contract procedures in 1989. She also organized sessions on the city's economy with officials, executives and economists speaking and touring sites from the Fresh Kills landfill to the Hunts Point market.         She started the league's popular reference booklet "They Represent You and Your Community," listing elected officials with their addresses and telephone numbers and district maps.         When the city created community boards, she produced an explanatory pamphlet. And to visualize the city's economy and financing, she created charts titled "Money Go Round."         She also worked several stints in government. She served in the city transportation agency and in public relations for Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She was also an aide to Angier Biddle Duke and Eleanor Roosevelt at the United Nations.         Mrs. Sable, whose maiden name was Berger, was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University. Her husband of 48 years, Benjamin, died in 1986. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz, a great-grandniece of Chief Sitting Bull, who devoted her life to making American Indian culture available to other Americans, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 85 years old and had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, and Douglaston, Queens, since 1928.         She died of cancer, said Marjorie Weinberg, a family friend.         As director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island from 1930 to 1950, Rosebud, as she preferred to be called, enthralled legions of visitors with information about and stories from Indian culture.         Rosebud, who was born near Rapid City, S.D., was a descendant of the Lakota-Oyate, called the Sioux by the white settlers. Through her family's prominence, she came to know many well-known figures like President Calvin Coolidge, whom she helped induct into Lakota membership in 1927; Cecil B. DeMille, who tried to persuade her to star in his films, and the planner Robert Moses, who hired her for the Jones Beach post.         Last year Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was her name that inspired Orson Welles to make "Rosebud" the last word spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of his 1941 film classic, "Citizen Kane." He based his assertion on what he said were recently discovered daily sign-in sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Mr. Welles and Rosebud worked on several dramatic shows during the late 1930's.         Mr. Welles, who died in 1985, never revealed the source for the name "Rosebud."         After leaving her post at Jones Beach in 1950, Rosebud continued to lecture and write on Indian culture. Her book, "The Album of the American Indian," was published in 1969 by Franklin Watts Inc., and a second book, "Tonewaya and the Eagles," was published in 1979 by Dial Press.         In 1989 Rosebud received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of South Dakota. She had attended the university from 1925 to 1927.         Rosebud's first husband, Arthur de Cinq-Mars, died in 1949. A sister, Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse, died in 1981.         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz is survived by her husband, Alfred Frantz; a daughter, Tachawin Moy, of Brooklyn; a granddaughter, Karen Winona Moy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Evelyn Robe Finkbeiner, of Bad Pyrmont and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.       
         Bertina Suida Manning, a scholar of Italian art and a collector of French and Italian paintings and drawings, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         She died of heart failure, said a friend, Mary Jane Harris.         Mrs. Manning was born in Vienna and was the only child of William E. Suida, an eminent Viennese art historian known for his work on Leonardo da Vinci and Genoese painting. She moved with her parents to the United States in 1939 and attended Queens College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she met her husband, Robert Lee Manning, an art collector who became director of the art gallery at Finch College in Manhattan.         With her father, she wrote a book on Luca Cambiaso, a 16th- century Genoese painter. From her father, Mrs. Manning inherited thousands of Italian and French paintings and drawings, to which she and her husband added major works. During the 1950's she advised the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. In 1962-63, she and her husband organized the first United States exhibition of Genoese painting, which traveled from Dayton, Ohio, to Sarasota, Fla., to Hartford. Since 1989 she had served as president of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College.         The Mannings were known for making their collection at their home available to students, curators and many others from around the world. Works from the Suida Manning collection have been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and the National Gallery in Washington, among other institutions. Paintings by Guercino and Mattia Preti are among the works now on loan to the Metropolitan, where they are on view in the museum's galleries of Baroque painting.         She is survived by her husband; her daughter, Sandy Manning Dolnier, and a grandson, John Robert Dylan.       
         Elinor Kridel Bernheim, a social-welfare volunteer whose widely cast interests ranged from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and Columbia University's School of Social Work to a community center she founded in the Bronx, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 85 years old.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Bernheim relentlessly made the rounds of board rooms, foundation offices and charity luncheons and dinners, starting in the 1940's. In 1975, she still sat on the boards of 11 charities. At the time, The New York Times's About New York column described her as "The Queen of Volunteers," who was "the champion volunteer worker in town."         "I love this kind of work," she said between meetings with people who held the purse strings to grants for worthy causes. Sometimes it kept her busy for 15 hours a day, she said.         "You know why we do it?" she asked. "Because it shows we're alive. So many of the younger women now want to get paid. It's a status thing with them."         "I'll tell you what I'm good at," she declared. "I'm good at finding people for boards because I know a lot of people. I'm good at organizing, fund-raising and whipping up enthusiasm.         "I don't fight with anyone unless I have to get things done -- and then I'm a dog, very mean." She also was a critic of professional social-work jargon that she said could scare otherwise interested laypeople off.         Mrs. Bernheim, whose late husband, Leonard, was a stockbroker, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1985. She recovered enough to return to the causes closest to her heart -- in a wheelchair or by telephone -- until her death.         Among those lasting interests were the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, which she began in the 1950's and presided over until 1970. It was innovative because it was affiliated with a hospital, Montefiore Medical Center. Others included the New York chapter of the National Council on Alcoholism and Young Concert Artists, which helps talented young people to start a career.         Also remaining dear to her heart was the New York School of Social Work at Columbia, a place where she did postgraduate work after her 40th birthday, in the 1947-48 academic year. She later served as a member of its advisory board and took special pride when Columbia awarded her its Bicentennial Medal in 1956. It was but one of many honors bestowed on her.         Mrs. Bernheim was born Elinor Kridel in New York City on June 26, 1907, and graduated from Vassar College in 1928. By 1941, she was a member of the board and the council of the Association for Aid for Crippled Children.         Her relationship with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies went back to her years as a young woman. She became a trustee in 1942 and two years later was co-host of a luncheon addressed by Eleanor Roosevelt.         She served as chairwoman of the women's division fund campaigns in 1943, 1944 and 1949. After that, she became a vice president of the federation and board chairwoman of the women's division.         Over the decades, Mrs. Bernheim also was an officer or otherwise involved in, among others, the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Conference for Social Welfare, an advisory committee on volunteer services for the Veterans Administration, the United Neighborhood Houses of New York City, the National Council on Social Work Education and the Associated Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations.         She was also involved with the Community Council of Greater New York, the Community Service Society, the National Homemakers Service Council and the Brookdale Institute on Aging, among others. She was a co-founder of the Florence G. Heller Research Center. She served three terms as vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York and was elected its first president in 1973.         Mrs. Bernheim's husband died in 1980. She is survived by two sons, Leonard H. Jr. and Charles A., both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.       
         Fairy D. McIntire, a religious leader and the wife of Dr. Carl McIntire, president of the International Council of Churches, died on Sept. 13 at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 85 years old and lived in Collingswood, N.J.         She died of cancer, said a daughter, Celeste M. Bashaw of Princeton, N.J.         Mrs. McIntire was deeply involved in the work of Mr. McIntire's church, the Bible Presbyterian Church, in Collingswood, and in the international council, an organization of more than 500 fundamentalist churches.         She was president of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Faith Theological Seminary in Elkins Park, Pa., and chairwoman of the auxiliary to the Christian Admiral Bible Conference and Freedom Center in Cape May, N.J.         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a son, Carl T., of Toronto; another daughter, Marianna M. Clark, of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a sister, Oleta McCarty, of Pensacola, Fla.; 13 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Gertrude Farber Koskoff, a three-term Representative in the Connecticut General Assembly and former member of the State Board of Parole, died on Thursday at her home in Plainville, Conn. She was 81 years old.         She died of complications from pancreatic cancer, said her son, David.         Active in the Republican Party, Mrs. Koskoff served as a state legislator from 1953 to 1958. She focused on civil rights, the rights of the handicapped and prison reform.         During riots at the state's prisons in the 1950's, Representative Koskoff acted as a mediator at the request of the prisoners. In 1968, she was named to the Parole Board by Gov. John Dempsey, where she served until her retirement in 1990.         Besides her son, of Plainville, she is survived by her husband, Milton M. Koskoff; a daughter, Harriet K. Ziering of San Francisco; two brothers, Alan and Daniel Farber, both of Worcester, Mass; a sister, Lillian Feinberg of New York City, and a grandson.       
         Dr. Gloria Glikin Fromm, a professor of English at the University of Illinois in Chicago, died Nov. 12 at Governors Park, a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Barrington, Ill. She was 61 years old and lived in North Barrington.         She died of complications from lung-cancer, said her husband, Harold.         Dr. Fromm specialized in biography and modernist studies, covering writers in the first half of the century, particularly T. S. Eliot. Ezra Pound and Virginia Woolf. She was the author of many essays and "Dorothy Richardson: A Biography" (University of Illinois Press, 1977), the life of the pioneering English writer of stream-of-consciousness fiction.         Born in Newark, she received her undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees from New York University. She began her academic career at Brooklyn College in 1961 and, in 1970, moved to the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, where she became a full professor in 1978.         Besides her husband, Dr. Fromm is survived by her sister, Selma Margolis, and her brother, Nathan Glikin, both of Union, N.J.       
         Janice Gilbert Fulton, a bridge expert and game-show personality in the early days of television, was presumed dead after a boating accident last week near her home about 150 miles north of Haiti, her lawyer said yesterday.         The lawyer, Ian Miller, said that Mrs. Fulton's husband, David Fulton, 70 years old, a mining engineer, was also presumed dead, as was Dan Cooper, 45, a Canadian real estate developer who was a passenger when the Fultons' 22-foot fishing boat capsized in choppy waters on Thursday morning.         Mr. Miller said he notified the authorities when the Fultons failed to return to their home, on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.         He said rescuers found two survivors, Douglas Colledi of London, Ontario, and Lucien Vixama of Providenciales, in the Fultons' righted boat on Friday. A search of the Caribbean by private planes and the Coast Guard was called off on Sunday.         Family members said Mrs. Fulton was born in New York City about 1920. She played Little Orphan Annie on radio soap operas. Later she played the Paying Teller on the television give-away show "Break the Bank" in the 1950's.         In 1955 she married Tobias Stone of Las Vegas, Nev., a champion bridge player who taught her to play the game. They won the Goldman Pairs in 1957, making them the only married couple to win in the 64-year history of the event; they also won the Master Mixed Team Championship in 1965. She won three other national titles: the Women's Teams in 1956 and 1969 and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1965.         Mr. Stone and Mrs. Fulton divorced in 1975, and in 1980 she married Mr. Fulton, who had been the chief mining engineer in the Stone family gold and silver mining business, where she worked from 1974 to 1978.         Mrs. Fulton's first husband, William Miles, lives in Los Angeles. Her second husband, William Dunlop, is deceased. She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Miles of Los Angeles, and by a daughter, Leslie Coren of Hallandale, Fla.       
         Hadassah, a pioneer of Israeli and Indian dancing in America, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Milton Epstein.         Hadassah, who was born in Jerusalem and whose original name was Hadassah Spira, became interested in Indian dancing at an early age. She studied dance in the United States and abroad, learning a wide range of Indian styles along with Javanese court dance, Japanese dance and modern dance. Her teachers included Ram Gopal and Jack Cole.         Hadassah, a performer of special eloquence, made her professional debut in 1945 and continued to perform Indian, Israeli, Javanese and Balinese dance through the mid-1970's. She appeared at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., four times in the 1950's and 60's and toured India in 1959-60.         Among Hadassah's best-known works was "Shuvi Nafshi" ("Return, Oh My Soul"), based on Psalm 116. Her "Tagore Suite," commissioned by the Tagore Centenary Committee, was performed for the first time in 1961.         Hadassah was also a popular teacher, known for her great warmth, who taught Israeli and Indian dance across the United States and abroad. She was a faculty member, board member and chairwoman of the ethnic division at the New Dance Group Studio in Manhattan and continued teaching through the mid-1980's.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Harriet Silverstein of San Diego, and three brothers, Simon, also of San Diego, Israel, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Abraham, of Yardley, Pa.

         Alice I. Bryan, a psychologist who fostered the advancement of women in her profession and who led a major study on the role of libraries, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, her relatives said. Her death was reported yesterday by Columbia University, where she had taught for 35 years.         Dr. Bryan was a founder and president of the National Council of Women Psychologists. Its first meeting was held in her apartment. She was also an officer of the American Association for Applied Psychology and the American Psychology Association.         This year she addressed the American Library Association, which honored her on the 40th anniversary of her book "The Public Librarian." Based on interviews with more than 3,000 librarians, it explored the role of libraries as centers of mass communication.         Dr. Bryan started teaching part time at Sarah Lawrence College and Pratt Institute in the 1930's, and joined Columbia's Library School in 1939 as a psychologist and teacher. She became its first female full professor and helped organize its doctoral program. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Bryan, whose family name was Bever, was born in Kearny, N.J. Her marriages to Chester Bryan and Frank Blasingame ended in divorce. Her third husband, George V. Fuller, died in 1960.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Vanessa S. Lynn, a New York gallery director who wrote about contemporary American crafts, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center. She was 42 years old and lived in Valley Stream, L.I.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lynn held a B.A. degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton and an M.A. in library science from Queens College. During the 1970's she worked as an art and architecture librarian at Pratt Institute.         She was a founder, in 1979, of the Cooper/Lynn Gallery in Manhattan, which presented works in clay, fiber and metal. She was also an advocate for removal of the distinction between crafts and fine arts, a theme that permeated her writing.         In 1985, she became the director of Gallery at Workbench, based at the chain's main store at Park Avenue and 32d Street. It showed the creations of young furniture artists. She also traveled to Workbench's other stores in the city.         She was a regular contributor to periodicals, including American Craft, American Ceramics, Metalsmith, Ornament, Glass and the German crafts magazine Art Aurea. At the time of her death, she was associate editor of American Ceramics magazine.         Mrs. Lynn is survived by her husband, Lawrence R.; her mother and stepfather, Sylvia and Ralph Lippman of Manhattan; a brother, Keith Stanger of Ypsilanti, Mich., and four stepbrothers, David Lippman of Eureka, Calif., Dr. Jay Lippman of Manhattan, Jonathan Lippman of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Leonard Lippman of West Hartford, Conn.       
         Paula Antoinette Neill, owner of And Why Not?, a clothing boutique in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, died on Friday after she was struck by a commuter train at the Baldwin Station of the Long Island Rail Road. She was 37 years old and lived in Baldwin, L.I.         Ms. Neill, a former dietitian, founded the boutique four years ago to showcase fashion and art by young black men and women. She was born in Jamaica and came to the United States in 1970.         Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for the L.I.R.R., said Ms. Neill's death was under investigation.         She is survived by her husband, Aubey Neill, of Baldwin; a sister, Myrna Shrouder; a brother, Ken Chong, and her parents, Zena and Linton Shrouder, all of the Bronx.       
         Charlotte Jones, an actress who appeared in plays and musicals on and Off Broadway and in regional theater, died on Nov. 6 at Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. She was 76 years old and lived in Toms River.         Her death was reported yesterday by her husband, Matteo Bocchino, who said she died of heart disease.         Ms. Jones, whose original name was Charlotte Nathanson, was born in Chicago on Jan. 1, 1916. She was a graduate of Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa, and attended Loyola University Medical School and Loyola University Law School in Chicago. A first marriage, to Dr. Richard Jones of Chicago, ended in divorce in 1947; subsequently Ms. Jones came to New York City to make a career as an actress and dancer, and won her first role on Broadway in 1952 in the musical "Buttrio Square," starring Billy Gilbert. In 'Camino Real'         She appeared in Elia Kazan's Broadway production of Tennessee Williams's play "Camino Real" in 1953, and acted in the play again when it was revived at Circle in the Square in 1980 under the direction of Jose Quintero.         She created the dual roles of Madame Branislowski and Mother Burnside in the 1966 Broadway production of "Mame," starring Angela Lansbury; played the Wall Street widow, Mrs. Millhauser, in the 1967 Broadway musical comedy "How Now, Dow Jones," and acted with Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in 1976 in "A Matter of Gravity." She also played the role of the Fortune Teller in Mr. Quintero's Kennedy Center revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," starring Elizabeth Ashley, which came to Broadway in 1975.         Off Broadway, Ms. Jones appeared in the 1962 production of Thornton Wilder's "Plays for Bleecker Street" at Circle in the Square, in a production directed by Mr. Quintero. She also appeared in "Serjeant Musgrave's Dance" in the 1966 production at the Theater de Lys.  Over 60 Character Roles         Her other Off Broadway credits included "Red Roses for Me," "The Girl on the Via Flaminia," "The Sign of Jonah," "The Knight From Olmedo" and "The Night Is Black Bottles."         Ms. Jones played over 60 character roles in stock theater, and performed in national tours, including that of "Come Blow Your Horn." Her Hollywood films included "Muggable Mary, Street Cop," "Lovers and Other Strangers," "The Fool Killer" and "Middle of the Night."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard David Jones of Three Rivers, Mass.; a daughter, Jeanette Jones Backs of Atlanta; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         Mrs. Furman died of complications of diabetes, said her family, which reported her death yesterday.         Mrs. Furman, who was a graduate of Finch College, had suffered from diabetes since infancy. She devoted her life to urging the public in general and those suffering from diabetes in particular to press for more research that might lead to a cure.         The foundation is the chief private financial supporter of scientific research on diabetes.         The New York Juvenile Diabetes Foundation chapter is the largest of the organization's 126 chapters in the United States and abroad. Mrs. Furman helped found the volunteer organization in the early 1970's, and served a year's term as president from 1974 to 1975. She also held several other positions with the foundation.         In 1992, Mrs. Furman received the Shining Star Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for her "longstanding commitment to find the cure for diabetes."         Mrs. Furman is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Julie Rosenthal, and two sons, Matthew and Ted, all of New York City.         Correction:  November 27, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, misstated her age. She was 52 years old.       
         Allene Z. Roach, a journalist and teacher whose struggle with Alzheimer's disease was described in a 1985 book by one of her daughters, died on Friday at the Fairfield Division of the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 65 years old.         She died of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Marion Roach Smith. Mrs. Smith wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine and a book, both titled "Another Name for Madness" (Houghton Mifflin, 1985), about her mother's ordeal.         Mrs. Roach attended Northwestern University and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1950. She began her career as a reporter and society editor of The Long Island Star-Journal, a daily newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that is defunct.         After earning a master's degree in education from the New School for Social Research in 1970, she taught at Escuela Hispana in Manhattan until her retirement in 1980.         She grew up in Douglaston Manor, Queens, and lived there until she moved into a nursing home eight years ago. Her husband, James P. Roach, who died in 1978, was the sports editor of The New York Times from 1958 to 1973.         In addition to Mrs. Smith, an author and freelance writer who lives in Petersburgh, N.Y., Mrs. Roach is survived by her daughter Margaret, the gardening editor of Newsday, who lives in Manhattan and Copake Falls, N.Y.       
         Sylvia Friedlander Robins, a theater and television producer, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74 years old.         She died of natural causes, said her husband, Sy R. Robins.         Mrs. Robins's credits include "Bathsheba," a 1947 play that featured the actor James Mason in his first Broadway appearance. From 1975 until 1989 she was the producer of the syndicated television talk show "All About TV."         Mrs. Robins was born in New York. She attended Smith College and began her career in the 1940's working with the producer David Susskind on television projects including "The Kay Kayser Show" and "The Nash Airflite Theater."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Claudia Whitman of Peaks Island, Me., and Debbie Robins of Los Angeles, and a brother, Norman Friedlander of Massapequa, L.I.       
         Regina Carrol, an actress who starred in many cult horror movies, died on Nov. 4 in St. George, Utah. She was 49 years old and had homes in St. George and in Palm Springs, Calif.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Al Adamson, a film director.         Miss Carrol, whose name was originally Regina Gelfan, was born in Boston. Her film credits included "Two Rode Together" with James Stewart, "The Slender Thread" with Sidney Poitier and "Viva Las Vegas" with Elvis Presley. She met her husband in 1969, when he was casting "Satan's Sadists," in which she starred, and appeared in many of his later films, including "The Female Bunch." Her last screen appearance was in "Carnival Magic" in 1982.         Miss Carrol also appeared on television in the "Dinah Shore Show," "Route 66" and "Ozzie and Harriet."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, Barney Gelfan, and a brother, Carl Gelfan, both of Los Angeles.       
         Barbara Kauder Cohen, the author of more than 30 books for children and young adults, died on Sunday at her home in Bridgewater, N.J. She was 60 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Cohen's first book, "The Carp in the Bathtub," was published in 1972 when she was 39 years old. It won acclaim as a modern classic, enough to encourage her to leave her teaching position and devote more of her time to writing.         The book, like many of those that came later, was published by Lothrop and remains in print.         The range of her themes was unusually wide. A 1990 novel, "The Long Way Home," tells of a family coming to terms with cancer. "Molly's Pilgrim" (1983) is the story of a Jewish immigrant girl who enhances the meaning of Thanksgiving for her entire third-grade class; a movie version won an Academy Award in 1986 in the short-subject category.         "Canterbury Tales" (1988) re-creates the flavor of the time and the spirit of Chaucer's words for young readers. Graduated With Honors         A native of Newark, Mrs. Cohen was a 1954 graduate of Barnard College (magna cum laude; Phi Beta Kappa), and earned an M.A. from Rutgers University. She started a teaching career in 1955, in public schools in New Jersey.         She was inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame last year. Four of her books are to be published posthumously.         Mrs. Cohen's husband, Eugene, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughters, Leah Cohen Chatinover of South Windsor, Conn.; Sara Cohen of Kibbutz Ketura, Israel, and Rebecca Cohen Stewart of Bridgewater, N.J.; her mother and stepfather, Florence and Ed Nash of Bridgewater; a brother, Louis Kauder of Alexandria, Va.; a sister, Susan Schwirck of Rahway, N.J.; and three grandchildren.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Kathryn Beck Kris, a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist, died Sunday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 59.         Dr. Kris died of cancer, said Harvard University, where she worked.         Dr. Kris, who received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1959, was assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the medical school and psychiatrist to the University Health Services. The major themes of her scholarly work were the emotional development of students and their interactions with teachers and counselors.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Anton O. Kris; two sons, David S. and Michael M. Kris, and a sister, Mary Ellen B. Wohl.       
         Allison Assante, a composer and songwriter and supporter of the homeless, died on Friday at her daughter Paula Blasband's home in Manhattan. She was in her early 70's and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack and stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Assante worked for Duke Ellington, and among her better-known compositions were "Goodbye, My Love," "Lonely River" and "Everywhere I Go." She was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and the Songwriters Guild.         Early in her career she studied fashion design, was a model and appeared in Vogue. She became interested in jazz in Chicago during the 1940's.         Long active in behalf of the homeless, she composed and produced a musical, "Heartbeat of the Street," to raise money.         She was also a board member of the Sarah Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem.         Mrs. Assante was born in Lafayette, Ind. Her first marriage ended in divorce. Her husband of 34 years, Mario Assante, a physician, died several years ago.         In addition to her daughter Paula Blasband, she is survived by her daughter Julia Mason of Manhattan; a brother, Arthur Mavity of Indianapolis; two sisters, Marion Greenwald of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Caraway of Watertown, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Sybil Claiborne, a novelist and short story writer, died Wednesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Hospital. She was 69.         She died of lung cancer, said Grace Paley, the writer, who was a friend.         Ms. Claiborne was active in the antiwar movement and frequently wrote in opposition to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. She was a board member of the War Resister's League for many years.         Ms. Claiborne was in her 50's when her first stories began to appear in magazines like The New Yorker and Esquire. Some of her writing was the basis for a program of comedy-dramas performed in Manhattan in 1978 at Symphony Space.         Her book "Loose Connections," a collection of short stories, was published by Academy Chicago in 1988, and a novel, "A Craving for Women," was published by Dutton in 1989.         Last year she completed "In the Garden of Dead Cars," which is to be published by Cleis in the spring. It is a work of fiction that again reflects her abhorrence of war and tyranny, Ms. Paley said.         At her death, Ms. Claiborne was chairwoman of the Women's Committee of PEN, the writers' organization. She was also a member of the National Writers' Union, of which her husband, Robert Claiborne, was an organizer and founder. He died last year. Her only son, Jan Stacey, died in 1990.         She is survived by a stepdaughter, Amanda Claiborne Shulman of Cambridge, Mass.; a stepson, Sam Claiborne of Brooklyn; a grandson, Matthew Shulman, and a brother, David Resnik of Stockbridge, Mass.         Correction:  December 20, 1992, Sunday         The headline on the obituary of a writer and antiwar campaigner yesterday rendered her last name incorrectly in some copies. She was Sybil Claiborne.       
         Clara M. Hale, who nurtured hundreds of abandoned and orphaned babies, the most fragile victims of New York City's epidemics of drug abuse and AIDS, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mother Hale, as she was known, was a pioneer in self-help efforts in poor neighborhoods and came to symbolize the untapped potential of disadvantaged groups taking care of their own. She eventually won international recognition for her efforts, and President Ronald Reagan saluted her as an "American heroine" in his 1985 State of the Union address. Battled Bureaucrats         At times she battled government bureaucrats who resisted her unorthodox methods. But public support helped her gain government grants and persuade officials to bend rules like the requirement that young children be reared in private homes instead of the group care she provided.         She started her work with babies in 1969 in her Harlem home and soon moved the program to a five-story brownstone at 145 West 122d Street. In the early days, the babies slept in cribs next to Mother Hale's bed.         As recently as a few months ago, she kept at least one child in her room, often choosing the neediest one. She expressed frustration when failing health made her too weak to hold a baby. Took in Nearly 1,000 Infants         Aided by donations, a growing staff and volunteers, Hale House took in nearly 1,000 infants, many still trembling from withdrawal pangs after becoming addicted to drugs in the womb.         With nourishment, nurture and play, most of the addicted infants recovered from the effects of fetal drugs and alcohol. But those born infected with the AIDS virus faced a drastically shortened life of suffering that Hale House tried to alleviate.         Her program especially drew attention in the 1980's, when so-called boarder babies languished for months in municipal hospitals, at a cost of several hundred dollars a day for each one. No one else wanted them, and the city's social-services agency was ill-prepared to place them.         "I'm not an American hero -- I'm simply a person who loves children," Mrs. Hale said recently. Explaining her approach to the children, she said: "We hold them and touch them. They love you to tell them how great they are, how good they are. Somehow, even at a young age, they understand that. They're happy, and they turn out well."         She said she expected to keep caring for children "until I die."         Hale House's policy is to reunite children with their families after the parents recover from their addiction, and it says it has been able to do so with about 90 percent of the children. Some children remained exceptionally close to Mother Hale, who considered them part of her own family.         Mrs. Hale's philosophy and mission were rooted in the travails of her own life.         She grew up in Philadelphia. Her father was murdered when she was a child, and her mother took in boarders and ran a lunchroom for longshoremen. Mrs. Hale credited her mother -- who died when she was just 16 -- with instilling the values on which Hale House is based.         After high school, she married Thomas Hale. They moved to New York, where he ran a floor-waxing service and studied business administration in night classes at City College. Mrs. Hale worked as a domestic and cleaned Loews theaters. Left to Rear 3 Children         Her husband died of cancer when she was 27, leaving her to rear three children, Nathan, Lorraine and Kenneth. At first she cleaned homes by day and theaters by night.         But then, reluctant to leave her youngsters, she started taking in other children for $2 a week and eventually became a licensed foster parent. She took in seven or eight children at a time. Eventually she reared 40 foster children, keeping them out of trouble and steering them from the temptations and dangers of the street. She emphasized reading and good behavior, and frequently treated them to trips to museums and other outings.         All made it through high school and many went to college, and they rewarded Mrs. Hale with 60 children of their own whom she regarded as her grandchildren.         The next phase of Mrs. Hale's life started in 1969, by chance. Her daughter, Lorraine, was driving on 146th Street when she was distressed to see a drug-addicted woman on a crate nodding off with her 2-month-old baby slipping out of her arms. 'She Says You Sent Her'         Impulsively, Miss Hale stopped, got out and admonished the woman to seek drug treatment and temporarily leave the baby with Mrs. Hale -- then 63 years old and retired.         The next morning, they later recalled, Mother Hale telephoned Lorraine to say, "There's a junkie at my door, and she says you sent her." Lorraine confirmed that she had, and Mrs. Hale took the baby. Word spread, and soon a steady stream of babies were placed with her.         Lorraine Hale went on to earn doctorates in developmental psychology and child development. In the mid-1980's, she became the executive director of Hale House and later its president. She plans to continue operating Hale House and its growing programs at other sites.         Hale House was renovated in 1975 with aid from Percy E. Sutton, then the Manhattan Borough President, with nurseries, a central kitchen and dining room, a playground, and many mirrors, placed at a toddler's eye level.         Throughout the Beame and Koch administrations, Hale House won waivers from state regulations barring group nurseries for children under the age of 5. But in 1989, saying that the crack epidemic had crested and the city was doing better in finding foster homes for children, the Dinkins administration stopped referring children to Hale House. Increased Fund-Raising         Mrs. Hale refused to give up. The flow of children continued, brought to Hale House by desperate parents, police officers, churches and other groups. To finance their care without government money, Hale House increased its private fund-raising.         Its budget last year was $3.5 million, and Hale House has been championed over the years by celebrities like Lena Horne, John Lennon and Tony Bennett.         In the last two years, Hale House has expanded its programs. They include housing and educating mothers after detoxification; apprentice training for youths who start to stray, and a home for mothers and infants infected with the AIDS virus. The organization also hopes to create Hale Haven, a larger version of the original Hale House, which will continue to house infants.         In addition to her daughter, Lorraine, Mrs. Hale's survivors include two sons, Nathan and Kenneth, and several grandchildren.         A service will be held at noon on Wednesday at the Riverside Church on Riverside Drive at 122d Street in Manhattan, with viewing from 9 to 11:20 A.M.       
         Marilyn Neufeld Bergner, a professor and researcher who helped to develop a widely used system for evaluating the medical condition of patients, died Dec. 12 at her home in Silver Spring, Md.. She was 59.         She died of ovarian cancer, her family said.         Since 1986, Dr. Bergner was a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.         In her prior teaching post at the University of Washington School of Public Health from 1972 to 1986, she was on the team that developed the Sickness Impact Profile. It measures the patient's level of functioning and monitors the progress during the course of an illness, based on periodic questionnaires filled out by the patient. The form is now widely used around the world.         Dr. Bergner was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. After earning a doctorate in socio-medical science at Columbia University in 1970, she served two years as an assistant to the first vice president at New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation.         Surviving are her husband of 39 years, Dr. Lawrence Bergner, a physician; her mother, Clara Neufeld of Brooklyn; two sons, Daniel of Manhattan, and Robert of Montreal, and a granddaughter.       
         Margaret Hockaday LaFarge, a pioneer among women in the advertising industry whose saucy, irreverent ads shook up Madison Avenue, died on Friday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 85.         She died in her sleep of heart failure, said her niece, Susan Hockaday Jones.         Miss Hockaday, who used her maiden name professionally, was founder and president of Hockaday Associates, a New York agency with a reputation for whimsy and flair. The Hockaday ads were so inventive that they were frequently reported on in the general press and the trade magazines.         She made her first big splash in 1953 with Dunbar furniture, picturing sofas, armchairs and beds in treehouses, on city streets, in green fields -- everywhere but in their normal setting.         Then followed the Capezio campaign, starting in 1956, in which the shoe company was presented as a state of mind, with shoes not even mentioned in the ads for several years. Her "Capezio people" appeared everywhere; some critics complained that the ads did not picture the product, but they sold shoes.         Her most quoted slogans were for swimwear and Scotch: "Just wear a smile and a Jantzen," and, "As long as you're up, get me a Grant's."         Under her direction Hockaday Associates, which had started out in 1949 in a converted barber shop on 58th Street, moved to 575 Madison Avenue. Her list of accounts grew to include Fuller Fabrics, Crane stationery, Health-tex clothing for children, Elizabeth Arden, Reed & Barton silver, Royal Worcester Porcelain.         Her husband, L. Bancel LaFarge, an architect, died in 1989. Besides her niece, Susan, of Princeton, N.J., she is survived by two nephews, Peter Hockaday of San Francisco and John Hockaday of Alexandria, Va.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Barbara Rollock, an authority on children's literature who worked for 32 years with the New York Public Library, died on Sunday at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 70 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of colon cancer, said her son David.         Joining the Public Library as a clerk at the Aguilar Branch Library in Harlem in 1945, Mrs. Rollock rose to become coordinator of Children's Services in 1974, a post she held until retirement.         For nearly a decade, she moderated the weekly show, "World of Children's Literature," on WNYC public radio, receiving the International Reading Association's media award for radio in 1982.         Mrs. Rollock was former president of the New York Black Librarians Caucas and a past president of the children's divisions of the American Library Association and the New York Library Association.         She was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in Library Science from Columbia University.         She is the author of two books, "Black Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books," published in 1992 by Garland Publishing, and "Public Library Services for Children," published in 1988 by Library Professional Publications. She also edited the 1974, 1979 and 1984 editions of "The Black Experience in Children's Literature," a bibliography, published by the New York Public Library.         Besides her son David, of Zionsville, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Howard, and another son, Phillip Theodore, also of Brooklyn.       
         Carol Bondhus Fitzgerald, head of readers' services at the Mina Rees Library of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Tuesday in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 51 and lived in Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Professor Fitzgerald died of cancer at Northern Westchester Hospital Center, said Christy DeBoe Hicks, a City University spokeswoman.         A specialist in American Presidential bibliographies, Professor Fitzgerald was the series editor of three continuing multivolume bibliographies: Bibliographies of the American Presidents, Bibliographies of the United States, and Bibliographies of American Notables. She had been editor of American History: A Bibliographic Review from 1985 to 1991, and history editor of the Bulletin of Bibliography from 1981 to 1990.         She was born in New York City. She graduated from Rosary College in River Forest, Ill., and earned master's degrees at New York University and Columbia University. She joined the Rees Library in 1969.         She is survived by her husband, Kevin; a son, Matthew; three daughters, Anna, Katherine and Margaret, all of Bedford Hills; her mother, Anna Bondhus; her brother, Nelson, of Farmington, Conn., and a sister, Diana Bortolin, of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Mary Green, a dancer, an actress, a writer and a longtime assistant to Agnes de Mille, died on Dec. 16 at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. She was 82 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, said Miss de Mille, who announced the death yesterday.         Mrs. Green was trained at the Lester Horton school in Los Angeles and performed with the Lester Horton Dance Theater. Her film and theater roles included the player queen in the stage production of "Hamlet" starring Leslie Howard, and she played the dancer in a film version of "Romeo and Juliet" that starred Norma Shearer. With her husband, the late Dennis Green, she served as scriptwriter for "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," starring Basil Rathbone.         Mrs. Green was managing director of the Agnes de Mille Dance Theater from the 1960's through the early 70's, and she assisted Miss de Mille in her lecture appearances.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Maria Teresa Herrera-Uslar, the Dowager Marquesa de Torre Casa, who was a society figure, philanthropist and author, died on Saturday at the Caracas Medical Center in Venezuela. She was 78 and lived in Caracas.         The Marquesa, who was widely known as Mimi Herrera, died of heart failure due to complications from cancer, said her son, Reinaldo Herrera, whose wife is the fashion designer Caroline Herrera.         The objects of the Marquesa's philanthropy included the Venezuelan Red Cross, of which she was chairman for many years, and the National Gallery in Caracas. She was also active in the affairs of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. For more than 40 years, she maintained an apartment in Manhattan.         She was born Maria Teresa Ladron de Guevara in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, and was educated by tutors. Her writings include a book-length collection of her short stories in Spanish, titled "Sad Tales," which was published in Venezuela and Spain, and a Spanish translation of "The Rubaiyat" of Omar Khayyam that came out in Venezuela and is to have a new edition there next year.         Her husband of 30 years, Reinaldo Herrera-Uslar, the Marques de Torre Casa, who owned sugar cane plantations, died in 1962. She is survived by two sons, Reinaldo Herrera of Manhattan and Caracas, who is an editor of Vanity Fair magazine, and Luis Felipe Herrera-Guevara of Caracas, and nine grandchildren.       
         Judge Frances Williamson Lehrich, a lawyer and former New York City magistrate, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Jacqueline L. Becker of Boca Raton, Fla.         Judge Lehrich, who was born in Brooklyn, forged a distinguished legal career at a time when such opportunities were all but closed to women.         A graduate of Girls High School in Brooklyn and Barnard College, Judge Lehrich attended Yale Law School, where she was the first woman to become a member of the Yale Law Journal. She graduated from Yale in 1922 and joined the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.         In 1935, she was appointed an assistant corporation counsel of New York City during the term of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. In 1938 he appointed her secretary to the Board of Estimate and, in 1941, to a 10-year term as a City Magistrate. Judge Lehrich was the third woman in the city's history to be appointed to the bench.         After leaving the bench in 1951, Judge Lehrich continued to practice law and to be active in civic affairs. During the 1960's and 1970's she was a member and chairman of the Arbitration Association of America.         Judge Lehrich's husband, Henry, a lawyer, died in 1966.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a grandson, a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Helene Wallace Toolan, a cancer researcher, died on Sunday at Southwestern Vermont Hospital Center in Bennington. She was 80 years old and lived in Old Bennington, Vt.         She died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her family said.         Dr. Toolan, a native of Chicago, graduated with honors from the University of Chicago at the age of 17 and received a Ph.D. in pathology from Cornell Medical Center. She was on the staff of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York from 1950 until 1964.         Dr. Toolan did basic research on the transplantation of human tumors and tissues into laboratory animals. In 1955 she received the Sloan Award for her work. Linked Cancers to Virus         She also studied the relationship between viruses and human cancer cells, leading a team of researchers that succeeded in linking viruses to eight types of human cancer in 1960. Previously only leukemia, a cancer affecting the blood, had been linked to a virus.         In 1964 Dr. Toolan moved to Bennington to direct the newly established Putnam Memorial Institute for Medical Research. In 1987 the institute was renamed the Helene W. Toolan Institute for Medical Research. She became director emeritus and senior scientist of the institute in 1978 and director emeritus and trustee in 1985.         Dr. Toolan was also an avid gardener, horticulturist and ornithologist, and participated in a project to beautify downtown Bennington in the early 1970's. The Garden Club of America gave her its Horticulural Award in 1982.         Her first husband, Dr. Edward Wallace, died in 1943. She later married Dr. James M. Toolan, who survives her. Also surviving are two sons, Robin Wallace of Gainesville, Fla., and Alan Wallace of Las Vegas, Nev.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Boyle, a short-story writer and novelist renowned for her deft and powerful style and her keen insights into human nature, died on Sunday night at the Redwoods, a retirement community in Mill Valley, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived at the Redwoods, where she had moved from San Francisco several years ago.         She had been in declining health for a year, said her son, Ian von Franckenstein of Kentland, Calif.         Miss Boyle wrote four dozen books, including many works of fiction, seven books of poetry and four books for children. But it was for her short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, Harper's and elsewhere, that she was particularly acclaimed. Some critics have called "The White Horses of Vienna" (1936) an especially fine collection of her stories.         She won two O. Henry Memorial Awards for short-story writing, one for the title story of that 1936 collection and one for "Defeat" in 1941. She also won a Guggenhiem Fellowship in 1934. The Lady as Radical         The writer Stephen Vincent Benet once described Miss Boyle's style as being "as bright as an icicle and light as the bones of a bird." And the critic Louis Kronenberger once contended that the fineness of her insights was "such as no other writer of our time, in English at least, can match."         Her work, which also included essays and translations, commanded admiration from critics for more than half a century. It was colored by years of living in different parts of Europe -- she moved to Brittany in 1923, then lived in Paris and elsewhere -- and by social and political concerns. Her 1936 novel "Death of a Man" contained material from her life in Austria in the mid-1930's.         Late in her life, Miss Boyle wrote that she saw herself "as a dangerous 'radical' cleverly disguised as a perfect lady." She reported that she could not remember a time beyond the age of 6 when she had not been committed in favor of, or opposed to, something. Her activities ranged from helping the families of conscientious objectors in World War I to supporting human-rights causes and demonstrating against United States involvement in Vietnam. But she also had passionate and abiding literary concerns.         Reviewing a 1988 collection of her short stories, "Life Being the Best & Other Stories," edited by Sandra Whipple (New Directions), Ann Hornaday wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book celebrated her "enduring artistic discipline.' At Home in Europe         "Unlike some of her better-known peers," Ms. Hornaday wrote, Miss Boyle "survived the halcyon days of Paris in the 1920's," and although she "is not as notorious as some of the other Moderns -- those intrepid expatriate writers who set out to change language, mesh literature and social context and expose the dissonance of contemporary life -- she evokes these tensions with a gossamer fineness."         Miss Boyle was born in St. Paul on Feb. 19, 1902, the daughter of Howard P. Boyle and the former Katharine Evans. She spent much of her childhood in Europe and then returned to the United States, where she attended school in Washington for a time.         After financial problems, the family moved to Cincinnati. Miss Boyle took violin lessons at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and attended the Ohio Mechanics Institute from 1917 to 1919, intending to go into architecture.         With her first husband, Richard Brault, a French engineer whom she had met in Cincinnati and married in 1923, Miss Boyle briefly lived in New York City, where she attended Columbia University. The couple then went to Europe, where Miss Boyle stayed for almost 20 years, living in England as well as France and Austria, and taking a fellow American expatriate, Laurence Vail, as her second husband in 1931 after she was divorced from her first.         In that period, she looked more kindly on Europeans than on her compatriots and on many of her fellow female writers. "I like to be with people who work -- English, French, or any foreign working people," she wrote, but "I am ill at ease with Americans."         She observed that most women "do not write simply or violently enough for my taste." She added, "I should like my prose to be lucid, direct and lean." A Poet in Later Years         Miss Boyle and Mr. Vail returned to the United States in 1941. They later divorced, and in 1943 she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein.After World War II she was a correspondent in Europe for The New Yorker for a time. She went on to become a professor of English and creative writing at San Francisco State University from 1963 to 1979.         Her son said her last new book to be published was was "Words That Must Somehow Be Said: Selected Essays of Kay Boyle" (North Point Press, 1985).         Reviewing "50 Stories," a collection of her work published in 1980, Vance Bourjaily wrote in The New York Times that the stories included such techniques as "literary simplification, rhythmic repetition, the mixing in of vernacular, stream of consciousness, density of impressions, radical imagery and experiments with surrealism." The collection was republished this year by New Directions Books.         Mr. Von Franckenstein said Miss Boyle had continued to write and that most of her recent work was poetry, some of which had been published.         In addition to her son, an actor whose stage name is Ian Swift, she is survived by a sister, Joan Detweiler of Sarasota, Fla.; four daughters, Sharon Cowling of Vezenobres, France; Kathe Vail, who lives outside Paris; Clover Vail of New York City, and Faith Gude of Boston; 17 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Antoinette Deland Carter, a travel writer, died on Friday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 53 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Carter died of cancer, said her husband, Stephen Carter.         Known professionally as Antoinette Deland, she wrote three popular travel guides: Fielding's Worldwide Cruises, which she began writing in 1985 and wrote for five revised editions; Fielding's Far East, which she wrote in 1983, 1987, and 1990, and Fodor's Bermuda, which she wrote from 1979 through 1987.         Mrs. Carter was a native of Rochester.         She studied at Bryn Mawr College and received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley.         In addition to her husband, Stephen, an architect and photographer who contributed to her articles, Mrs. Carter is survived by two brothers, Dr. Thomas Killip, of Manhattan, and Colbeth Killip, of Ogonquit, Me., and an aunt, Priscilla Balaban, of Wilmington, N.C.       
         Estelle Bauer, who practiced law for more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         She died of pneumonia, said her daughter, Dr. Joyce Brothers, the psychologist and television personality.         Mrs. Bauer and her husband were partners in the Manhattan law firm that carried his name, Morris K. Bauer. She retired after his death in 1979.         Besides their law practice, the Bauers were associate producers with Alexander H. Cohen and Joseph Kipness of several Broadway productions in the 1950's.         Mrs. Bauer, a native New Yorker, graduated from Brooklyn Law School.         Besides her daughter Joyce, Mrs. Bauer is survived by another daughter, Elaine Goldsmith of Somerset, N.J.; a brother, Irving Rapaport of Los Angeles; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Jennie Resnick Bernstein, the mother of Leonard Bernstein, who contributed lyrics for a segment of his last musical work, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 94 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.         The family said she died after a stroke.         Mrs. Bernstein collaborated with her son on "Arias and Barcarolles," a song cycle that received a Grammy Award in 1991 for best contemporary composition.         Leonard Bernstein died in 1990. Mrs. Bernstein's husband, Samuel, died in 1969.         Mrs. Bernstein is survived by a daughter, Shirley Anne Bernstein of New York, a son, Burton Bernstein of Bridgewater, Conn., and five grandchildren.       
         Emily Martenet Gnichtel, who was active in New York philanthropic organizations, died Tuesday evening at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 56 and lived in Madison, N.J., and at the Onteora Club in Hunter Township, N.Y.         She died of heart failure after a short illness, said her husband, William Van Orden Gnichtel.         Over the years, Mrs. Gnichtel, whose surname is pronounced NICK-tell, was a member of the board of the Sheltering Arms Children's Service and the Katherine Herbert Fund, a foundation aiding people with lung ailments, and did volunteer work on behalf of the Welfare Trust Fund of the Junior League.         She also did volunteer fund-raising for educational institutions, including Smith College.         Mrs. Gnichtel was a horsewoman and served on committees of the National Horse Show Association.

         Ruth Lynch Saunders, a psychoanalyst and a former magazine editor, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and also lived in Siasconset, Mass.

Mrs. Saunders received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1949, a master's degree from Columbia University School of Social Work in 1976, and a certificate in psycholanalytic training from the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy in 1979.

         Helen Callaghan Candaele St. Aubin, the speedy outfielder whose swing won one batting title and inspired two movies about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died Tuesday night at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., at age 69. She died of breast cancer, according to her son Kelly Candaele, whose 1988 documentary about his mother's career, "A League of Their Own," inspired last summer's movie of the same name.         During her four seasons in the women's league that was formed in 1943 as a wartime alternative to the talent-depleted men's league, Mrs. St. Aubin, who played under her original name, Helen Callaghan, batted .257 and stole 354 bases in 388 games.         Mrs. St. Aubin was a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, who had been recruited at a Canadian softball tournament. Accompanied by her sister, Margie, who was sent by their father to keep an eye on her, she broke in with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes in 1944 and was an immediate star. She stole 112 bases in 111 games, and her .287 batting average was the league's second highest.         In 1945, when the team moved to Indiana and became the Fort Wayne Daisies, Mrs. St. Aubin, a left-handed batter, led the league with a .299 average and in extra-base hits (24), doubles (17) and home runs (3).         She became ill in 1946 and sat out the 1947 season before returning for part of the 1948 season, her last, and she was never again as sharp at the plate. But she stole 114 bases in 111 games in 1946.         Her former teammate Dottie Collins recalled yesterday how deceptive her appearance was on the field.         "When she was playing -- running or throwing -- she looked so dainty, that's the only word for it," said Mrs. Collins, who recalled the 5-foot-1 1/4-inch, 115-pound outfielder as a "tiny" woman who was "strong."         According to Mrs. Collins, the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, Mrs. St. Aubin's stance and swing are almost perfectly preserved in her son Casey Candaele, a switch-hitting infielder for the Houston Astros.         She married Bobby Candaele during her career and gave birth to the first of their five sons before the 1948 season. They settled in Lompoc, Calif., where she became a cleaning staff supervisor at a local hospital. She and Mr. Candaele were eventually divorced, and she later married Ronald J. St. Aubin.         The documentary Kelly Candaele and his friend Kim Wilson made in 1988 led directly to the movie starring Geena Davis and directed by Penny Marshall.         In addition to her husband, her sister, who is now Margaret Maxwell of Vancouver, and her sons Kelly and Casey, Mrs. St. Aubin is survived by a brother, Lou; two other sisters, Pearl McInnis and Kay Morrison; three other sons, Ricky, the former head football coach at the University of California at Santa Barbara; Rocky, a telephone company employee, and Kelly's twin brother, Kerry, a Richard Hofstadter fellow in history at Columbia University, plus three grandchildren.
