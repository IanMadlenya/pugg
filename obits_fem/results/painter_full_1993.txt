         Julia Jones-Pugliese, who took up fencing as a New York University student in 1927 and five years later began a 60-year career as one the nation's premier coaches, died on Saturday after coaching Hunter College's men's team at a meet at St. John's.         She was 84, and according to her family, she suffered a heart attack at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan.         The first woman to coach a collegiate fencing team, Mrs. Jones-Pugliese led N.Y.U. to national championships in 1933 and 1938 and coached the Hunter team to a national title in 1970. She had been the Hunter coach since 1956.         For Mrs. Jones-Pugliese, stature was athletic destiny. Deciding she was too short to join the N.Y.U. basketball team, she took up fencing and helped found the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association. The association, whose membership grew from 4 to more than 70 colleges, conducts what is considered the oldest collegiate championship for women in any sport.         Mrs. Jones-Pugliese's husband, Anthony Pugliese, a painter and sculptor, died in 1953. She is survived by a sister, Erma Stim of Plainview, L.I.; a daughter, Penelope Shaw, an instructor in modern dance and Yoga at Hunter; two sons, Patri, who teaches physics at Harvard, and Paul, a cartographer for Time magazine; six grandchildren, and one great grandson.       
         Judith Rothschild, an abstract painter whose works were shown internationally and who left a multi-million-dollar estate to support contemporary American artists, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan and in Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Ms. Rothschild painted for 55 years, beginning as a teen-ager. Her works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery in Washington and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., among others.         Her works were exhibited in many group shows and in several one-woman shows, including the first devoted to an American artist by the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, in 1991. Legacy to Museums and Artists         Ms. Rothschild left a collection that included her paintings and major works by Mondrian, Matisse, Brancusi, Gris and Picasso. The estate could bring up to $40 million, said its executor, Erik Stapper, and Harvey Miller, the trustee of the Judith Rothschild Foundation.         Under her will, the proceeds are to be used to foster art by helping public galleries and museums buy works of contemporary American artists over the next 25 years.         Ms. Rothschild was a founder and president of the American Abstract Artists Association. She also served on the boards of the American Federation of Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the New York Studio School and the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center.         A longtime colleague of Robert Motherwell, she joined him and a few other artists in forming a cooperative, the Long Point Gallery, in Provincetown on Cape Cod. A Youthful Talent         Ms. Rothschild displayed a flair for art as a youngster. Because of her interests, her parents began collecting art, including some of the major pieces now part of her estate. Her father, Herbert, owned a furniture manufacturing company.         Ms. Rothschild was born in New York City and graduated from Wellesley College. She studied painting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, and with Karl Knaths and Hans Hofmann.         She worked in oils and did many collages. Her style ranged from Cubist imagery to symbolic use of astrology charts, timetables, stamps and railroad tickets.         Her 23-year marriage to Anton Myrer, a novelist, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Manhattan, and a sister, Barbara Michaels of Ossining, N.Y.       
         Ethel Magafan, a muralist and painter of semi-abstract Western landscapes, died on Saturday at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 76.         The cause was a series of strokes, said her husband, Bruce Currie.         Ms. Magafan was born in Chicago and grew up in Colorado Springs, Colo. She and her twin sister, Jenne, an artist who died in 1952, studied with Boardman Robinson and the muralist Frank Mechau at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. In the late 1930's and the 40's, she painted Government-sponsored murals in post offices in Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado and Arkansas, as well as in two Federal office buildings in Washington and the chamber of the United States Senate.         Her last mural, "Grant in the Wilderness," was installed in 1979 in the Chancellorsville Visitors Center at the Fredericksburg National Military Park in Virginia.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Jenne Magafan Currie of Manhattan.

         Mary Spencer Nay, a painter and retired art professor, died on Saturday at her home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was gastrointestinal illness, said her daughter Malu Nay Block of Provincetown.         Ms. Nay was born in Crestwood, Ky., and graduated from the University of Louisville with a master's degree. She began teaching art at the university in 1942 and was a professor of art education when she retired in 1979.         She settled in Provincetown, where she had spent summers since 1937. She was active in the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, the Heritage Museum, the Historical Association and the Visual Artists Cooperative.         Her paintings, mainly abstractions inspired by Provincetown and her travels in Mexico, hang in numerous museums and private collections. The J. B. Speed Art Museum in Louisville presented a retrospective of her work in 1976.         In addition to her daughter Malu, she is survived by another daughter, Fayette Block, also of Provincetown; a sister, Dorothy Nay Carter of Vine Grove, Ky.; a brother, Benjamin Franklin Nay of Bremerton, Wash., and two grandchildren.       
         Dame Freya Stark, a resourceful and scholarly travel writer who was the first Westerner to journey through many regions of the Middle East, died on Sunday at her home in Asolo in northeast Italy. She was 100..         Dame Freya, who was born in Paris and grew up in several homes in England and Italy, wrote 24 travel books and autobiographies and eight volumes of letters from the 1930's to the 1980's. Many of the books have been reprinted several times, recently by Transatlantic Arts and Overlook Press, among other houses, and were based on often hazardous journeys by vehicle, camel and donkey.         Dame Freya's books about the Middle East and nearby countries were called lucid, spontaneous and elegant and were lauded for imparting an inspired sense of both history and people. The consensus of reviewers was that she wrote with spirit, authority and humor and that she was a consummate traveler because of her fearlessness, candor, charm, idealism and streak of naivete.         In a foreword to "The Journey's Echo: Selections From Freya Stark" (1964), the writer Lawrence Durrell praised her as a "poet of travel" and "one of the most remarkable women of our age." Many Languages and Dialects         Dame Freya was essentially self-taught. In her youth, she became fluent in Arabic and Turkish, and over the years she mastered other languages and many dialects. It was a talent that served her well in the course of a venturesome life as reflected in the titles of her books: "Baghdad Sketches" (1933 and 1937), "The Valleys of the Assassins and Other Persian Travels" (1934, 1972 and 1978), "The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut" (1936 and 1972), "A Winter in Arabia" (1940, 1972 and 1987), "Letters From Syria" (1942), "The Freya Stark Story" (1953), "Alexander's Path" (1958 and 1988) and "Gateways and Caravans: A Portrait of Turkey" (1971).         Freya Madeline Stark was born in Paris on Jan. 31, 1893, to Robert Stark, a British sculptor, and Flora Stark, a painter and pianist. Her parents separated in her childhood, and her formal education was mainly at the University of London and the nearby School of Oriental and African Studies.         In World War I she was a nurse in Italy, and in World War II she worked for the British Information Ministry, earning prominence and honors for enhancing British influence and countering Axis propaganda in Aden, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and India. In Cairo, she founded the Brotherhood of Freedom, a democratic anti-Fascist movement.         Years later, she observed that Britain eventually lost India and prestige throughout the Middle East because of "a lack of clearness and faith in our own values." Honors and Godchildren         She was awarded a Cross of the British Empire in 1953 and was named a Dame of the British Empire in 1972.         In 1947, when she was 54, she married Stewart Perowne, a diplomat and historian. They separated in 1952 but did not divorce. Mr. Perowne died in 1989. They had no children, but Dame Freya had many godchildren, in many countries.         One godson, Malise Ruthven, wrote a 144-page tribute, "Traveler Through Time: A Photographic Journey With Freya Stark," which was published in 1986. In the book, he observed: "Freya never lost her passion for acquiring fresh knowledge and new skills. Writing, like travel, she saw as the pursuit of truth."         At 93, as she was planning a trip to Spain, Dame Freya was asked about death. She replied, "I feel about it as about the first ball, or the first meet of hounds, anxious as to whether one will get it right, and timid and inexperienced -- all the feelings of youth."       
         Vera, the artist and designer whose name has been emblazoned on brightly printed scarves, bed and table linens, draperies and sportswear for nearly 50 years, died on Tuesday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.         The cause was cardiac arrest after surgery, said Tom Costello, a friend and business associate.         Vera Neumann, who used only her first name professionally, was a painter whose work was exhibited in many countries, and her designs typically began as paintings. For motifs, she preferred flowers, leaves, ferns, grass, vegetables, the sun and ladybugs. A "ladybug means good luck in every language," she said.         She introduced the first signature scarf in the late 1940's. Another trend she started was to offer collections saluting the countries she visited in her frequent travels, including Brazil, Denmark, Finland, India and Portugal. A Taste for Purity         Vera's style could be realistic or abstract. Her penchant for purity could mean a scarf or place mat printed in one color at a time when other designers might have used a dozen.         "If you have too many colors," she explained, "you could easily get tied down to just one color scheme that can't be changed." A shy, private person, she did not like to make speeches. "Color is the language I speak best," she said.         Vera was born in Stamford, Conn., and took night classes at Cooper Union, which honored her with its Outstanding Alumna Award. She was a designer of children's furniture and murals when she met and married George Neumann. They and a third partner, F. Werner Hamm, each risked $1,000 in 1946 to start a business. Its first order, from B. Altman, was for three place mats, made of parachute silk and hand-delivered by Mr. Hamm.         The enterprise prospered. By 1977, Vera designs were sold in more than 1,200 stores, with sales of more than $100 million. The company had been bought 10 years earlier for $5 million by Manhattan Industries and has been a division of Salant Corporation since 1988. Vera Companies -- Scarves by Vera and Linens by Vera -- has showrooms on Fifth Avenue, and Vera herself continued to supply designs until several months ago.         Vera's husband died in 1960. She is survived by her daughter, Evelyn Fyler of Ossining; her son, John Neumann of Carmel, N.Y, and four grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Tobey, a painter known for her covers for The New Yorker, died on June 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was in her mid-80's.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her son, David.         Mrs. Tobey, whose original name was Beatrice Szanton, was born in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Vienna. While attending Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, she landed the part of an ingenue in a Broadway show. After the show closed, she went to Hollywood to pursue an acting career, but she returned to New York a year later.         In 1928, she married one of her former high school classmates, Barney Tobey, a cartoonist whose work would appear regularly in The New Yorker for the next five decades, until his death in 1989.         Mrs. Tobey attended the Art Students League, where she studied with Yasuo Kuniyoshi. She developed an Expressionist style, and her work was exhibited in galleries in New York. Between 1959 and 1969, she contributed 11 covers to The New Yorker, signed B. Szanton to distinguish them from the cartoons and covers of her husband, who signed his work B. Tobey.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Natasha Tubelskaya, of Rome.       
         Ruth Krauss, the author of "The Carrot Seed," "A Hole Is to Dig: A First Book of First Definitions" and other books for children, died on Saturday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 91.         Ms. Krauss was born in Baltimore, where she attended the Peabody Institute of Music. She received a bachelor's degree from the Parsons School of Fine and Applied Art in New York City.         Her first book, "A Good Man and His Good Wife," with illustrations by the abstract painter Ad Reinhardt, was published in 1944. Over the next four decades, she wrote 34 more books for children, many of them illustrated by her husband, David Johnson Leisk, who wrote children's books under the pen name Crockett Johnson. He died in 1975. Eight of Ms. Krauss's books were illustrated by Maurice Sendak, beginning in 1952 with "A Hole Is to Dig."         At a time when children's books tended to be didactic, with lots of text, Ms. Krauss pioneered the use of minimal text, concentrating on precise language and working closely with an illustrator.         In addition to children's books, Ms. Krauss wrote verse plays and poetry for adults.         She was awarded the Caldecott Medal for "The Happy Day" (1950) and "A Very Special House" (1954).       
         Vivian E. Browne, a professor of art at Rutgers University and a painter whose work linked abstraction to nature, died on July 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was bladder cancer, said her mother, Odessa Browne.         Ms. Browne joined the Rutgers faculty at Newark in 1970 as an instructor in the art and design department. She headed the department from 1975 to 1978, becoming a full professor in 1985. She taught contemporary black and Hispanic art, painting and other courses.         She was a founder of SoHo 20, a Broome Street gallery, established in 1973, that was one of the first women's art cooperatives in Manhattan. There she had several solo exhibitions, most recently in 1989, when she presented her oil and acrylic landscapes of towers and power lines superimposed on trees.         Her paintings are in many private, corporate and public collections.         Ms. Browne was born in Laurel, Fla. She graduated from Hunter College, earned a Master of Fine Arts degree, and studied for a time in Nigeria. Before joining Rutgers, she taught in high schools and colleges in New York and New Jersey.         She is survived, in addition to her mother, by two sisters, Lenice Pannell and Yvonne Allison, of Wheaton, Md.       
         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.         She played a key role in Womanspace, a program devoted to women's support services at Columbia University. An amateur painter, she served as administrator of the art school at the Museum at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970's and held private art classes for children.         Born in Brooklyn, she graduated from Adelphi College and earned a master's degree in comparative literature at Columbia University.         Mrs. Cooper's husband, Rudolf, a high school teacher, died in 1968.         She is survived by a daughter, Constance Cooper Batuscheck of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Kenneth, of Manhattan; a brother, David Buxbaum of Milwaukee, and a grandson.       
         Irene Sharaff, who designed costumes for Hollywood and Broadway, winning five Academy Awards and a Tony, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The immediate cause was congestive heart failure, said Jean B. Angell, a close friend who was also her lawyer. Ms. Angell said Ms. Sharaff had had emphysema.         In a career of more than half a century, Ms. Sharaff designed costumes for actors including Yul Brynner, Gertrude Lawrence, Gypsy Rose Lee, Judy Garland, Mary Astor, Pearl Bailey, Anouk Aimee, Gene Kelly, Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis Jr., Elizabeth Taylor and Rex Harrison. 60 Shows, 40 Films         She also worked in television, ballet, nightclubs and fashion illustration.         Her last Broadway show was "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," a 1989 musical that won six Tonys. She recreated costumes for several scenes from "The King and I" and "West Side Story."         Ms. Sharaff (pronounced SHAR-eff) designed costumes for more than 60 stage productions, including "As Thousands Cheer," "Lady in the Dark," "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" and "Idiot's Delight." Sometimes she designed the sets as well. She won two Donaldson Awards and a Tony.         She also worked on 40 films and received 15 Oscar nominations. She often designed clothes for both stage and screen productions of the same work, as with "Funny Girl," "Flower Drum Song," "West Side Story" and "The King and I."         Her sumptuous array of vibrant Thai silk costumes for "The King and I" in 1951 created a sensation in the world of high fashion and interior decoration, and she won her Tony for her designs. Within a few years of the show, silk became Thailand's best-known export. Seeing Blocks of Color         Ms. Sharaff, who once wanted to be a painter, said she saw everything in blocks of color, "rather like painting a picture." Speaking of her work, Ms. Sharaff said in a 1970 interview, "If I have a leitmotif, a logo, I suspect it is associated with the colors I prefer -- reds, pinks, oranges -- and with a certain cut which seems to reappear in many of the shows and films I've worked on."         "You can acquire chic and elegance, but style itself is a rare thing," Ms. Sharaff said in a 1967 interview. "The only theater people I can think of who have it are Audrey Hepburn and Betty Bacall. The one who had it to the greatest degree was Gertie Lawrence. She could make a sackcloth tied with a belt look stylish."         She first attracted attention in 1932, as designer of scenery and costumes for Eva Le Gallienne's "Alice in Wonderland." Two years later, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo shattered its nationalist tradition by hiring her to design the scenery and costumes for "Union Pacific" and Stravinsky's "Poker Game." She also designed costumes for American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet.         Her first Oscar honored her scenery and costumes in the ballet sequence in M-G-M's 1951 production of "An American in Paris." In 1956, she won another for her work on Samuel Goldwyn's 1956 film of "The King and I."         Her other Oscars were for "West Side Story" in 1961, "Cleopatra" in 1963 and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in 1966. She also worked on "Madame Curie," "The Best Years of Our Lives," "Meet Me in St. Louis," "Guys and Dolls," "Brigadoon," "Justine," "Porgy and Bess" and "Hello, Dolly!" Began as Fashion Illustrator         Ms. Sharaff was born in Boston and studied at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, the Arts Students League and the Grande Chaumiere in Paris. For a time she did fashion illustrations for American Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines.         After her debut with "Alice in Wonderland," she was regularly represented on Broadway with one or more productions a season until 1972. In 1976, she designed the costumes and scenery for a new production of "Fanfare" by the New York City Ballet. Her last films were "The Other Side of Midnight" (1977) and "Mommie Dearest" (1981).       
         Reva Clamage Shwayder, an artist who was the subject of a documentary film that won an Academy Award, died at her home in Franklin, Mich., on Thursday. She was 91.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Shwayder was married for 62 years to Benjamin Shwayder, who with his four brothers founded the Samsonite Corporation.         She took an interest in the business and sat in on family discussions guiding the growth of the company, said her grandson, Mark Shwayder.         Samsonite developed and became the world's largest manufacturer of hard-sided luggage, then expanded into the production of folding chairs and tables. Mr. Shwayder, who invented devices for the company, was its president.         Starting in 1950, Mrs. Shwayder became a painter, doing large worksin acrylics and water colors that featured bright flowers and landscapes in an abstract style.         When she retired two years ago, she had produced hundreds of paintings and had held many exhibits. She sold her works to private collectors and corporate clients including Ford, Chrysler, I.B.M. and Kresge, as well as to the Detroit Institute of Arts and Pennsylvania Academy of Arts.         Her husband died in 1981, and five years later she married Louis Gothelf, a painter, but she retained her original married name.         Mr. Gothelf's daughter, Sue Marx, joined Pamela Conn in directing "Young at Heart," which was shown at the New York Film Festival and won the Academy Award in the short subject category in 1988.         The movie focused on Mrs. Shwayder's career and remarriage late in life, and how she coped with the losses of her first husband and sons Warren, who died in a scuba diving accident, and Richard, who died of cancer soon after.         Mrs. Shwayder was born in Chicago and studied at the University of Chicago.         Her survivors include her husband; a sister, Anne Klein of Laguna Beach, Calif.; six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

         Bessie Boris, a painter of landscapes and portraits known for their rich colors and expressive distortions, died on Thursday at her home in Lee, Mass. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Rachel Klein, of La Jolla, Calif.         Miss Boris, who was born in Johnstown, Pa., studied at the Art Students League in the early 1930's and worked for the Works Progress Administration, teaching classes in a settlement house. Although she spent most of her life in New York City and Massachusetts, she had her first one-woman exhibition in 1949 at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., where her husband, George Klein, worked briefly as a psychologist at the Menninger Clinic.         Miss Boris specialized in a seemingly naive style that placed great emphasis on color and psychologically charged distortions of form. Throughout the 1960's, she was represented by the Cober Gallery in Manhattan; in the late 1980's and early 90's, she exhibited at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery in SoHo. In 1987, she had a retrospective at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass.         Her work is represented in the collections of the Denver Art Museum, the Newark Art Museum, the Smith College Museum in Northhampton, Mass., and the Berkshire Museum.         Miss Boris's husband died in 1971. She is survived by her daughter and a grandson.       
         Jennifer Howard Coleman, a painter and former actress, died on Tuesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 68.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Coleman's parents were Sidney Howard, who wrote the screenplay for "Gone With the Wind," and the actress Clare Eames. Mrs. Coleman had several Broadway stage and Hollywood film credits in the 1940's.         In 1950 she married Samuel Goldwyn Jr., a film producer. They were divorced in 1966, and in 1971 she married John E. Coleman, a painter, who died before her. Mrs. Coleman's watercolors and acrylics were on display at galleries in Santa Monica, Calif.         She is survived by three sons: Francis Goldwyn of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., John Goldwyn of Los Angeles, and Tony Goldwyn, the actor, of Hoboken, N.J., and a daughter, Catherine Goldwyn of Boston.       
         Dolli Tingle Brackett, an artist and designer of Christmas stamps for the Postal Service, died on Dec. 11 in Norwalk Hospital, Norwalk, Conn. She was 82.         The cause of death was respiratory failure, her son, Gordon Brackett, said.         Mrs. Brackett lived in Westport, Conn., for 47 years, and also had a winter residence and studio in Sarasota, Fla. Known professionally as Dolli Tingle, she exhibited her oils and watercolors in many museums and galleries on the East Coast.         In 1973, using needlepoint, she designed one of most popular stamps issued by the Postal Service, a depiction of a Christmas tree decorated with traditional ornaments, which drew upon memories of her childhood in Chicago. It took her 10 days to complete her needlepoint design using two strands of wool.         For her work on the Christmas stamp she was voted Woman of the Year by the American Needlepoint Guild.
