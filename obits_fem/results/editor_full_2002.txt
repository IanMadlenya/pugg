         Janice Farrar Thaddeus, a scholar, poet, editor and former Harvard lecturer in English, died on Dec. 23 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 68.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Patrick Thaddeus.         In ''When Women Look at Men'' (Harper & Row), the feminist anthology Dr. Thaddeus edited in 1963 with John A. Kouwenhoven, she and her co-editor provided an answer to the question why women do not achieve as much as men in the professions: ''They have no wives.''         Dr. Thaddeus also wrote scholarly articles on Jonathan Swift, Richard Wright and Anthony Burgess.         She wrote a biography, ''Frances Burney: A Literary Life'' (St. Martin's, 2000), about a writer who had been considered a minor novelist of manners even though she was admired by Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Jane Austen and Edward Gibbon.         Janice Farrar Thaddeus was born in New York City on July 20, 1933, into a family immersed in the literary world. Her father, John Chipman Farrar, was editor of The Bookman in the 1920's and a founder in 1946 with Roger Straus Jr. of the publishing house Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Her mother, Margaret Petherbridge Farrar, was the first crossword puzzle editor of The New York Times.         Dr. Thaddeus received a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1955 and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1965. In 1986 she became a lecturer in history and literature at Harvard. She retired in 1999.         In addition to her husband, an astrophysicist at Harvard and at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Dr. Thaddeus is survived by a daughter, Eva Thaddeus of Albuquerque; a son, Michael Thaddeus of Manhattan; a sister, Alison Wilson of Palo Alto, Calif.; and a brother, Curtis Farrar of Washington.       
         Naomi Bliven, a writer at The New Yorker for more than 40 years, died on Monday in New York, where she lived. She was 76.         She had lymphoma and had recently had a stroke. Ms. Bliven, who had been contributing to The New Yorker since the late 1950's and became a staff writer in 1961, wrote feature articles and ''Talk of the Town'' items, but she is best remembered as a perceptive and prolific book critic. She wrote more than 200 long reviews and thousands of shorter items for the magazine's ''Briefly Noted'' column.         Alice Truax, her most recent editor, said that at her peak Ms. Bliven wrote four reviews a week and probably contributed more than 2,000 reviews to the magazine. She said Ms. Bliven hungrily went through the weekly stack of books that the magazine sent her and if she was not satisfied with them, she went to a bookstore over the weekend to get more.         She remained productive to the end of her life. Her last review, of Beryl Bainbridge's ''According to Queeney,'' a historical novel about the circle surrounding Samuel Johnson, was published in the magazine's July 30, 2001, issue.         Ms. Bliven was born Naomi Horowitz in New York and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College. She worked at Random House, and her first credited article in The New Yorker ran in 1958.         She also wrote a novel, ''On Her Own,'' which was published by Grove Press in 1989.         From 1978 to 1996, Ms. Bliven held various offices, including secretary and vice president, at PEN, the national organization of writers and editors.         She was married to Bruce Bliven Jr., a writer and historian, who died on Jan. 2.         She is survived by a son, Frederic, of Manahattan; a brother, Daniel Horowitz, of Washington; and two nieces.       
         Elizabeth Mildred Riley, a prominent children's book editor, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 and lived on the Upper East Side.         Her publishing career was spent at the Thomas Y. Crowell Company, now merged into HarperCollins. She joined the company in 1938, rose to senior vice president in 1959 and retired about 30 years ago.         Ms. Riley built the children's division of Crowell and was especially noted for creating the ''Let's Read and Find Out'' series of science primers, started more than 40 years ago. She founded it with Dr. Franklyn Mansfield Branley, a science writer and teacher, as an introduction to a wide range of scientific subjects, attractively put together with pictures and plainly written texts. The books, designed for children from preschool through the early grades, counted well-known science writers among their authors. They have remained a pre-eminent series for decades, used in schools and libraries across the country.         Now the series is known as the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science Books. More than 100 have been published, with about 80 still in print and 6 new ones released each year by HarperCollins.         Elizabeth Riley, born on the West Side of Manhattan, graduated from New York University in 1928 and received a master's degree from Columbia University two years later. Her first job was selling books at department stores, including Macy's.         Munro Leaf -- a friend who was the creator of ''The Story of Ferdinand,'' the classic children's book about the bull who preferred smelling flowers to fighting other bulls -- recommended her to Crowell, where she started as a general editor. At the time, the publisher offered college textbooks but had nothing in print for young readers.         Ms. Riley was entrusted with creating the publishing house's children's book department, and she built it into one of the best. Many of the books she published won prizes, among them several Newbery medals as well as a Caldecott.         She retired when Crowell was bought by Dun & Bradstreet. From the time she joined Crowell, she had accepted stock options as bonuses; the takeover made her a well-to-do woman. But its terms also barred her from working any longer in children's books; she became a volunteer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, working in textile conservation and helping to organize files and photographs.         For many years Ms. Riley also did volunteer work for the Grolier Club, Unicef, the Hroswitha Society of book collectors, and the Pierpont Morgan Library, where she served on the board for 24 years.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Inge Morath, a photographer who brought a whimsical, lyrical touch to her images from travelogues to reportage to portraits, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Roxbury, Conn.         Arthur Miller, her husband, said the cause of death was lymphoma.         ''She made poetry out of people and their places over half a century,'' Mr. Miller said.         Her work included striking portraits of both posed celebrities and fleeting images of anonymous passers-by. Her feeling for places as reflected in images of Boris Pasternak's home, Chekhov's house and Mao Zedong's bedroom was so sensitive that some viewers insisted they could see invisible people.         But many critics said the pictures spoke eloquently for themselves.         ''Inge Morath possesses the priceless quality of making the world look as though it had been discovered only this morning and she was present with her lens to record its bright freshness,'' Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the couple's book ''In Russia'' (Viking, 1969).         In the later phases of her long career, Ms. Morath produced books with her husband: he provided words and she the pictures. Beyond their respective artistic talents, the books were enhanced by his easy access to top figures in culture and other fields and her great facility with languages. For example, she spent years learning Chinese before the couple tackled China.         In an essay in The New York Times concerning their book ''In the Country'' (Viking, 1977), Mr. Miller suggested such collaborations allowed the two to play with notions of time. ''As always, the camera sees the past -- all it can see -- and here it speaks of a symmetry of action and thought and a revolution based on empirical common sense, when in truth these people watch the television news for the event on Wall Street, in Washington or Korea that will affect the price of fertilizer and crops,'' he wrote. ''The surreal emerges from the fragility of what camera and mind can grasp as real.''         Inge MÃ¶rath (with umlaut over the o) was born on May 27, 1923, in Graz, Austria. (She lost the umlaut somewhere in her international career.) Her parents, both scientists, were well off and brought her up in their liberal Protestant tradition. They moved frequently, and were living in Berlin at the outbreak of World War II.         She was drafted to work in an airplane factory with Ukrainian prisoners of war after she declined to be a Nazi supporter. The factory was regularly bombed; after one bombing, she remembered running through the streets of the devastated city holding a bouquet of lilacs above her head. In an interview with Joyce Wadler that appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1998, she recalled walking through the countryside and witnessing the horror of war.         ''Everyone was dead or half dead,'' she said. ''I walked by dead horses, by women with dead babies in their arms. I can't photograph war for this reason.''         After the war, she used the language expertise she had honed at the University of Berlin to translate for occupying Americans, and then to work as Austrian editor of an American government-controlled magazine. She began to write articles to accompany the photographs of Ernst Haas, and was invited to Paris by Robert Capa with Mr. Haas to serve as an editor of the just-founded Magnum agency.         She began photographing in London in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson as a researcher in 1953 and 1954. In 1955, after working two years as a photographer, she became a member of Magnum, which functions as a cooperative.         Her many foreign assignments included a trip to Iran for Holiday magazine in 1956; there she wore the traditional chador and traveled alone most of the time.         In the late 1950's she saved Audie Murphy, the actor and war hero, from drowning when he was in Mexico making a movie ''The Unforgiven.'' Ms. Morath jumped into a cold mountain lake in her underwear, swam a half-mile and dragged Mr. Murphy back by her bra strap -- at least in her telling.         Other notable assignments included shooting the stills in London for John Huston's film ''Moulin Rouge'' (1952), in which she had to make do with three rolls of color film because it was so scarce at the time. She developed a lifelong friendship with Mr. Huston, something she often did with her subjects. ''Photography is essentially a personal matter, a search for inner truth,'' she said.         In 1960, she was photographing the filming of ''The Misfits'' in Reno, Nev. One of the stars was Marilyn Monroe, who was accompanied by her husband at that time, Mr. Miller. She took a famous image of the two together: Mr. Miller, with his cigarette, Monroe leaning out the window with her back turned.         But she said that it was difficult to get them close enough together to photograph. The marriage soon broke up; Ms. Morath married Mr. Miller in 1962, and they had one child, Rebecca, who lives in Manhattan. Rebecca has one son.         Ms. Morath -- who practiced yoga, swam daily and was a vegetarian -- continued to photograph until two weeks ago. Elliott Erwitt, a veteran photographer for Magnum, remembered her as a wonderful hostess. ''It was kind of a permanent salon that she managed beautifully,'' he said. ''She was at ease in any situation.''       
         Julia Phillips, the Hollywood producer who turned her rage at the stars and power brokers into the best-selling chronicle ''You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,'' died Tuesday at her apartment in West Hollywood. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Kate Phillips, said.         Julia Phillips was a producer of classics including ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' The 1973 film ''The Sting,'' which she produced with her husband at the time, Michael Phillips, and Tony Bill, won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. She was the first woman to produce a film that won the best-picture Oscar.         But Ms. Phillips's film career was dwarfed by her angry 1991 book about Hollywood and what Ms. Phillips viewed as the mendacity, selfishness, greed and hypocrisy of the town. She skewered numerous famous people, including Steven Spielberg, David Geffen, Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn. One producer described the book as ''the longest suicide note in history.''         But Ms. Phillips was far more brutal about herself than about any of the people she scorned. She detailed her descent into drugs, which almost killed her. She wrote that on Oscar night for ''The Sting'' in 1974, she took ''a diet pill, a small amount of coke, two joints, six halves of Valium, which make three, and a glass and a half of wine.'' The index listing of her name at the end of her book seemed to sum up her personal life: ''depressions of . . . drug wanderings of . . . pregnancies of . . . loneliness of . . . suicidal behavior of . . .''         As Ms. Phillips said in an interview several days before she died: ''I knew that if this book was going to be commercially viable, I would have to spill my guts. I knew I would have to be as honest as possible about myself as I was about all the others.''         To critics who termed the book cruel, she replied: ''We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints.'' She added, ''Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about.''         Ms. Phillips was feisty, funny and blunt, and never stopped loving the movies. In the days before she died, she sat in her apartment overlooking Los Angeles and talked about them; she asked friends to bring her a tape of ''Ocean's Eleven'' because she adored George Clooney.         ''I couldn't have made it today in the movies,'' she said at one point. ''In the 70's people were making some great films. Look what they're making now.''         In the last decade, Ms. Phillips struggled in vain to write another best seller. In 1995 she wrote ''Driving Under the Affluence,'' a sometimes surreal personal examination of her problems with the Internal Revenue Service, the 1992 Los Angeles riots and 1994 earthquake, the impact of AIDS and the death of her father. In 2000 she helped Matt Drudge, the internet commentator, write his book ''Drudge Manifesto.''         In recent years, Ms. Phillips, who was constantly battling financial problems, said she had considered trying to return to the movies. But her few meetings with younger executives left her despondent. ''Did I really want to be patronized once more as a woman?'' she said recently. ''Did I really want to be told what a major motion picture was?''         Ms. Phillips was born in New York City on April 7, 1944. Her father, Adolph Miller, was a chemical engineer. Her mother, Tanya, was, in Ms. Phillips's words, a difficult and depressive woman who drove her daughter to intellectual pursuits.         Ms. Phillips grew up in Brooklyn; Great Neck, N.Y.; and Milwaukee and attended Mount Holyoke, where she won awards for creative writing.         She married Michael Phillips, a Dartmouth graduate, shortly after their graduations. Mr. Phillips became an investment banker and producer. They were divorced months after ''The Sting'' won its Oscars.         Ms. Phillips worked at Ladies' Home Journal and McCall's and then became a story editor in the New York offices of Paramount Pictures. Her career started moving quickly when she was hired to find material for Barbra Streisand, among other jobs. Ms. Phillips helped get the rights to ''Yentl'' years before it was made.         In her mid-20's Ms. Phillips and her husband met the actor-producer Tony Bill, and the three optioned ''The Sting'' and ''Steelyard Blues,'' which became a film starring Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland and was made with the support of Richard Zanuck and David Brown.         The Phillipses moved to Los Angeles and soon became the nucleus of a group of young, dynamic filmmakers who were, essentially, taking over Hollywood in the 1970's, a time when the studio system was crumbling. Their friends included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, John Milius, Paul Schrader and others. It was also a time when drugs proliferated in Hollywood.         The high point of her career was Oscar night in 1974. Upon being handed the Academy Award for best picture by Elizabeth Taylor, Ms. Phillips said, ''You can't imagine what a trip it is for a nice Jewish girl from Great Neck to win an Academy Award and meet Elizabeth Taylor in the same night.''         The breakup of her marriage, drugs and a series of sour relationships with men, along with being elbowed out of the power loop in the making of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' pushed her over the edge. At one point, after a 30-day rehabilitation stay at the Mayo Clinic, Ms. Phillips said she had spent more than $120,000 on cocaine. By the early 1980's, Ms. Phillips said, she had turned her back on drugs with the help of various therapies.         Ms. Phillips recalled that she began writing her book because she was running out of money and felt a deep grievance against many in Hollywood. The book took several years to write and 14 months for Random House lawyers to clear.         Its publication turned her into an outcast among many of the Hollywood elite.         ''At first it bothered me because I really didn't expect that kind of reaction,'' she said. ''I thought people had a sense of humor. I really did.         ''Understand, I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother,'' she said. ''I was a pariah because I lit them with a harsh fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are.''         The book was criticized because Ms. Phillips recalled conversations from years before without the benefit of notes; she replied that she had a photographic memory. A harsher criticism was that the book discussed physical flaws of numerous people. Ms. Phillips said later that she had only one regret: referring to one woman as ''a city of flesh.''         In later years, Ms. Phillips said, she sometimes went to restaurants and accidentally met some of the people she had written about. She said they were polite, even friendly.         Ms. Phillips is survived by her daughter, of Los Angeles; her brother, Matthew Miller of Weston, Conn.; and her son-in-law, Modi Wiczyk of Los Angeles.         Her first book led Morton's, a popular movie industry hangout, to tell Ms. Phillips that she was unwelcome. But the restaurant soon rescinded its ban. Shortly before she died, Ms. Phillips recalled with a laugh that she had her daughter's 1999 wedding-rehearsal dinner at -- where else? -- Morton's. ''They had no problem taking my money,'' she said. ''That's Hollywood.''       
         Jane Montant, a former editor in chief of Gourmet magazine who prized passionate writing, died on Jan. 1 in her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         She had Parkinson's disease, emphysema and liver cancer, her son, Jon Carson of Boston, said.         She was editor in chief from 1980 to 1991, when she retired. During her tenure, Gourmet's circulation rose to 895,000 from 671,000.         At that time, Gourmet was the acknowledged leader among food magazines, but considered itself a lifestyle magazine for the affluent rather than just a food publication. For example, the number of articles about foreign travel grew steeply while she was in charge, along with revenue from travel advertisements. She found veteran cooks who could create and test recipes. She also had a knack for learning about and attracting talented writers and photographers to the magazine.         She began at Gourmet in 1953, answering mail from readers, and rose to be the magazine's executive editor from the early 1960's to 1980. For years, beginning in the 1960's, she largely set the magazine's look, style and content. The writers she attracted included James Beard, Joseph Wechsberg and Richard Condon.         ''Finding writers was easy,'' she told an interviewer once. ''I always looked for people who had passion. In the end it's the only thing that matters.''         She was born Jane Smallwood in Boston and grew up mostly in Manhattan. She graduated from the Todhunter School, a private school for girls in Manhattan.         Her 1945 marriage to Phil Montant ended in divorce.       
         Jean Patchett, a leading fashion model of the 1950's whose face was one of the signatures of a highly glamorous era, died on Jan. 22 at her home in La Quinta, Calif. She was 75.         The cause was emphysema, her husband, Louis Auer, said.         In a photograph in profile by Erwin Blumenfeld for the famous Jan. 1, 1950, cover of Vogue, Ms. Patchett's immaculate red mouth, penciled left eye and natural beauty mark became shorthand for an entire decade.         Although she worked frequently with the photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe and John Rawlings, Ms. Patchett was most frequently associated with Irving Penn, especially after a 1949 photograph he took of her chewing pensively on a string of pearls as she sat in a cafe, a picture that came about spontaneously. In later sessions, Mr. Penn would give her the suggestion of a story -- meeting a beau in a crowded theater, perhaps -- and as Ms. Patchett stretched her neck longer and longer in search of the imaginary boyfriend, he would click off image after image.         She was ''a young American goddess in Paris couture,'' Mr. Penn said on Monday. Ms. Patchett was among a handful of photographic models who dominated that era, a sorority that included Dovima, Dorian Leigh, Suzy Parker, Evelyn Tripp and Lisa Fonssagrives, who was married to Mr. Penn.         Ms. Patchett arrived in New York in 1948 from her family's home in Preston, Md., on the Eastern Shore. As she told the writer Michael Gross for his book ''Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women'' (Morrow, 1995), she moved into a Methodist rooming house for women, for $13.50 a week, and signed with Harry Conover's agency. Within a month, however, she had left for the new Ford modeling agency. That September she had her first Vogue cover.         By the time she retired in the early 1960's to raise a family, Ms. Patchett had appeared on more than 40 magazine covers, Eileen Ford said.         In a period when models could be deliciously snooty, Ms. Patchett was more modest: not the girl-next-door type, but not as sophisticated as Ms. Parker, either. She was punctual and polite, often saying ''yes, ma'am'' and ''no, sir.'' When she introduced herself to an editor or a photographer, she said: ''I'm Jean Patchett. You don't darn it. You patch it.''         Asked how Ms. Patchett dressed in that period, Mrs. Ford said, with some pride, ''We all shopped at Loehmann's.''         Ms. Patchett was pursued by many men, many of them wealthy. She was seen frequently at the Stork Club and was a regular at the Friday lunch that the club's owner, Sherman Billingsley, gave for models.         When Mr. Auer, a banker, met Ms. Patchett in 1948, he was living at the Yale Club. ''A couple of models I knew who lived at the Barbizon said, 'We've got a girl for you,' '' Mr. Auer recalled. ''We met at a luncheonette near the old DuMont studios.'' Soon after they started going out, Mr. Auer gave Ms. Patchett the nickname Pancho, which stuck. They married in 1951.         Ms. Patchett continued to model regularly until 1963. In the early 1980's, she and her husband moved to La Quinta.         In addition to Mr. Auer, Ms. Patchett is survived by their daughter, Amy Auer of Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; a sister, Mrs. J. Fred King; and a brother, Frank Patchet.       
         Virginia Hamilton, an internationally recognized writer for children whose work celebrated the African-American experience as an essential component of American life, died yesterday in Dayton, Ohio. She was 65 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.         The cause was breast cancer, said Kris Moran, director of publicity for Scholastic, Ms. Hamilton's publisher.         Ms. Hamilton, known privately by her married name, Virginia Hamilton Adoff, wrote more than 35 books in many genres that spanned picture books and folk stories, mysteries and science fiction, realistic novels and biography. Among her best-known works are ''The People Could Fly'' (1985), ''The Planet of Junior Brown'' (1971) and ''Many Thousand Gone: African Americans From Slavery to Freedom'' (1993).         She won a National Book Award in 1975 for her novel ''M. C. Higgins, the Great''; the book also received a Newbery award, the first to a black writer. In 1995 she became the first children's author to receive a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant.         Woven into her books is a deep concern with memory, tradition and generational legacy, especially as they helped define the lives of American blacks from the days of slavery onward. Ms. Hamilton described her work as ''liberation literature.''         Virginia Esther Hamilton was born March 12, 1936. She grew up on the small farm in Yellow Springs that had been her family's since the 1850's;  she later returned there with her husband and children.         She came from a family of storytellers. Ms. Hamilton's grandfather Levi Perry was born a slave in Virginia and crossed the Ohio River to freedom. Once a year, she wrote, he gathered his children around him. ''Set down,'' he would say, ''and I will tell you about slavery and why I ran, so that it will never happen to you.'' Ms. Hamilton was named Virginia in remembrance of his flight.         After attending Antioch College and Ohio State University -- she lacked the money to complete her studies -- Ms. Hamilton moved to New York. There, while studying writing at the New School for Social Research, she met the poet Arnold Adoff, whom she married in 1960. Mr. Adoff survives her, as do two sisters, Nina Anthony, of Columbus, Ohio, and Barbara Davis, of Los Angeles; two brothers, William Hamilton, of Englewood, N.J., and Kenneth James Hamilton Jr., of Chula Vista, Calif.; a daughter, Leigh Hamilton Adoff, of Berlin, and a son, Jaime Levi Adoff, of Manhattan.         Ms. Hamilton's first book, ''Zeely,'' appeared in 1967. At the time the few children's books about black people were mainly ''problem'' novels, which threw into sharp relief issues like segregation and poverty.         ''Zeely'' was a radical departure. It was not that race was absent, but that it was so completely, unremarkably present. Ms. Hamilton forsook gritty urban drama for a pastoral tale of enchantment whose characters happened to be black. The novel told the story of a girl who, during a summer on her uncle's farm, is captivated by an enigmatic local woman she believes is a Watusi queen.         Among Ms. Hamilton's many honors were an Edgar Allan Poe Award, a Coretta Scott King Award, a Hans Christian Andersen Medal and an honorary doctorate from Ohio State.         Many of her recent books were devoted to the black oral tradition; she combed dusty archives for early manuscripts with long-forgotten songs, riddles and stories.         The fruits of her travels included ''The People Could Fly,'' which retells slaves' traditional tales in an accessible vernacular, without the ugly misspellings historically used to render black dialect. The title story recounts: ''The one called Driver cracked his whip over the slow ones to make them move faster. That whip was a slice-open cut of pain. So they did move faster. Had to.''         The book's carefully worded subtitle, ''American Black Folktales,'' was itself a political statement, Ms. Hamilton later recalled. Her editor had urged on her the more conventional  ''Black American Folktales.''         ''No,'' Ms. Hamilton replied. ''They're American first and black second.''       
         Peggy Durdin, a foreign correspondent and writer who in the course of four decades covered almost every country in Asia, died on Feb. 12 in Encinitas, Calif. She was 92.         Ms. Durdin, who began writing in 1938 after marrying Tillman Durdin, a longtime foreign correspondent for The New York Times, almost immediately delved into areas that at the time were rarely covered by women.         Her articles in the early 1950's included profiles of Ramon Magsaysay, the president of the Philippines who was emerging as a new Asian leader, and Ho Chi Minh, who even then was a household word to millions of Vietnamese. She also wrote a detailed survey of Singapore, described as a ''bizarre, booming anachronism.''         In the 60's and early 70's, her dispatches had datelines that included Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, Thailand and Tonga.         Early in her career, she was based in New Delhi as the India-Burma correspondent for Time magazine. She later contributed freelance articles to The New York Times Magazine, Life, Look, Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and The Saturday Review. She also wrote many book reviews, primarily on books about Asia, for The Times.         Margaret Armstrong, known all her life as Peggy, was born in China, where her parents, Oscar V. and Lena Stutzman Armstrong, were Presbyterian missionaries. Her parents and their missionary friends took over her early education, and she went on to the Shanghai American School. She went to Agnes Scott College in Atlanta, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After graduation, she returned to the American School in Shanghai as head of the English department and remained there until her wedding, which was in Shanghai, then occupied by the Japanese. The couple moved to the Chinese wartime capital, Chungking, where their first house was bombed. When Mr. Durdin was covering Guadalcanal and New Guinea, Ms. Durdin was removed to Australia and worked in American Red Cross hostels there and in New Zealand. From 1943 to 1945, she was a political adviser to Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell.         She returned to China for three years, from 1945 to 1948. Moving to Hong Kong, she became active in China watching, as reporting on the closed Communist country from afar was known. In 1958, she was co-editor of The Atlantic magazine's special edition on Communist China and wrote a booklet on China for the Foreign Policy Association.         The Durdins spent time in Honolulu before returning to the mainland United States in the 70's. They were longtime residents of San Diego. Mr. Durdin died in 1998.         Ms. Durdin is survived by her brother, Oscar V. Armstrong of Mitchellville, Md., and Edward Chen of Hong Kong, whom the Durdins informally adopted.         Seymour Topping, a former Southeast Asia correspondent of The Times, said Ms. Durdin, with her language skills and experience, was a mentor to younger journalists like him and Theodore White.         Mr. Topping, later the foreign editor and the managing editor of The Times and now the administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and a professor of international journalism at Columbia University, noted in his 1972 book ''Journey Between Two Chinas'' that Ms. Durdin spoke colloquial Chinese and that she was especially unhappy when she later returned to China that the ordinary Chinese had grown afraid to talk to her.       
         Annalee Whitmore Fadiman, a screenwriter, World War II correspondent and the author, with Theodore H. White, of the best seller ''Thunder Out of China,'' died yesterday in Captiva, Fla. She was 85.         Mrs. Fadiman, who as a member of the Hemlock Society supported a right to suicide, took her own life, said her daughter, Anne. Mrs. Fadiman had been suffering from breast cancer and Parkinson's disease.         A woman successful in several careers, Mrs. Fadiman spent much of her life defying the conventions of professions dominated by men. Nancy Sorel, in her book ''The Women Who Wrote the War,'' called Mrs. Fadiman's career ''a real-life movie.'' Sidney Skolsky, the 1940's Hollywood columnist, called her ''the girl reporter of this war.''         Annalee Whitmore was born on May 27, 1916, on the kitchen table of her family's home in Price, Utah, the eldest of four children born to Leland Whitmore, a bank president who built and flew airplanes as a hobby, and Anne Sharp Whitmore, who later became a librarian at the main branch of the New York Public Library.         When Mr. Whitmore lost his job during the Depression, the family  moved to California and struggled to make ends meet. Ms. Whitmore attended Piedmont High School and was admitted to Stanford University in 1933 after scoring highest in the state on a college entrance exam.  She graduated in 1937, having served as the first woman to be managing editor of the Stanford Daily newspaper.         She took a $75-a-month secretarial job at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in San Francisco, but quit after a year when her boss asked her to type part of the manuscript of a memoir he had written.         In 1938, she moved to Los Angeles and joined the secretarial pool at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When she heard that MGM needed a film to occupy Judy Garland between ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms,'' she wrote a treatment in a single weekend and became the co-writer of ''Andy Hardy Meets Debutante''(1940), with Garland and Mickey Rooney.         With several more screenplay credits, she was offered a seven-year contract by MGM, but she dreamed of reporting in China, where war was already raging. The War Department allowed no female correspondents in China at that time, so in 1941 she landed a job as the Far East representative of a relief agency. Once in Chungking, writing speeches for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, she won a reporting job with Liberty magazine.         She married Melville Jacoby, a Time magazine correspondent she had first met when they were both Stanford undergraduates. Keeping barely a step ahead of the advancing Japanese forces after Pearl Harbor, they eventually withdrew to Brisbane, Australia. Mr. Jacoby was killed at 25 in an airfield accident near Darwin.         In 1944, Theodore H. White, the Time correspondent (he had been a close friend of Mr. Jacoby), finally persuaded his boss, Henry Luce, to seek War Department accreditation for Ms. Whitmore, so that she could join Mr. White in Chungking. She collaborated with him on ''Thunder Out of China,'' about China's role in the war, the strengths and weaknesses of the Kuomintang and the Communists, and the country's future. The book is still in print.         After the war, Ms. Whitmore wrote articles, lectured widely and appeared on the radio quiz show ''Information Please,'' where she met her second husband, Clifton Fadiman, the program's M.C. and the book reviewer for The New Yorker.         They were married in 1950, and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, of Massachusetts; a son, Kim, of Wyoming; a sister, Carol Whitmore of California; and two grandchildren. Mr. Fadiman died in 1999.       
         Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a multifaceted writer, defender of marine resources and founder of the International Oceans Institute based in Malta, died on Feb. 8 while on vacation in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 83 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.         Professor Borgese was the last surviving child of Thomas Mann. She was a pianist by training, a multilingual political scientist and a writer of fiction and of oceanic yearbooks.         She helped organize the international Peace in the Oceans Conference of 1970, the first of 30 such meetings worldwide. She was an enduring presence at those gatherings, which brought about the United Nations Law of the Seas treaty in 1982.         Elisabeth Mann was born in Munich, the second youngest of three girls and three boys of Thomas and Katia Pringsheim Mann. (W. H. Auden became her brother-in-law when the poet married her sister Erika to provide her with a British passport.)         Hoping to become a musician, Elisabeth studied the piano and cello, receiving a diploma from the Conservatory of Music in Zurich in 1938.         The Mann family had left Germany after Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland and, in 1938, to the United States. In 1939, Elisabeth married Giuseppe A. Borgese, a professor 36 years her senior who had fled Fascist Italy; he died in 1952.         She became a United States citizen in 1941 but took Canadian citizenship in 1983. She worked as an editor and researcher in Chicago, including two years as executive secretary of the board of the Encyclopedia Britannica in the mid-1960's.         She served as a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif., before joining the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1979, first as a political science professor and later as an adjunct law professor.         In the 1970's, Professor Borgese formed the International Oceans Institute, which has since grown to 20 centers.         She is survived by two daughters, Angelica Borgese of Manhattan and Turkey, and Dr. Domenica Borgese of Milan; a son, Marcel Deschamps of Halifax; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Eda J. LeShan, a psychologist and family counselor who brought psychoanalytic insights and common sense to two dozen books meant to guide people through life's challenges, died on March 2 at her home in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was kidney failure, said a nephew, Bruce LeShan.         Ms. LeShan was known for the motherly warmth she brought to books like ''The Conspiracy Against Childhood'' (Atheneum, 1967), her best-known work on raising children; her radio commentaries on CBS; and her show on PBS, ''How Do Your Children Grow?''         Her message to harried parents was to ease off on the pressure, and sometimes allow children to just daydream. She thought that the discussion of love was central to sex education, and that spanking could only make the child feel as bad as the angry parent.         She said every parent should have a sampler on the wall that says, ''I'm only human.'' Raising a child, she said, is like gardening, because each flower develops differently.         A reviewer in Publishers Weekly in 1978 wrote, ''Adults and young people have benefited from LeShan's fluent, sympathetic writing in books addressed to those in trouble.''         Eda Joan Grossman was born in Manhattan on June 6, 1922. Her mother, Jean Schick Grossman, was a parent educator, and her father, Max Grossman, was a lawyer and president of the Ethical Culture Society of New York.         She graduated from the Fieldston School in Riverdale, and received a degree in early childhood education from Teachers College at Columbia University. She earned a master's degree in child psychology from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.         Her life amounted to personal testimony to her message that people could continue to grow throughout their lives.         She wrote her first book when she was 43, began to appear regularly on a television show when she was 46 and got her own program on educational television when she was 48.         In addition to her books, which have been translated into nine languages, and her television and radio shows, she wrote a regular column for Newsday for years and was a contributing editor of Parents magazine. Her articles appeared in many magazines, including The New York Times Magazine in the 1960's. For nine years, she wrote the ''Talking It Over'' column for Woman's Day.         As she aged, she wrote more about older people. Her books include ''The Wonderful Crisis of Middle Age: Some Personal Reflections'' (McKay, 1973), ''Oh, to Be Fifty Again!'' (Random House, 1986) and ''Grandparents: A Special Kind of Love'' (Macmillan, 1984).         ''I used to be a child psychologist and I love children and I kind of miss that part of my life,'' she said in an interview on ''CBS This Morning'' in 1990. ''But I try to write the same way when I'm writing for older people, where I share my vulnerabilities and my aches and pains and my mood swings and so forth.''         She wrote a play in her 70's. It was called ''The Lobster Reef,'' in reference to the vulnerability lobsters experience when they shed their shells and are completely naked until they grow a new one. It told the story of a woman battling to rid herself of literal and figurative cancers.         When the one-woman play opened in 1995 on Ms. LeShan's 73rd birthday, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times that it was ''a striking creation'' that brought to life four generations. He wrote that it would be interesting to see what she could do if she put more than one character on stage.         She is survived by her husband, Lawrence LeShan, and their daughter, Wendy, who also lives in Riverdale.       
         Eileen Farrell, the American dramatic soprano who built a devoted following among the public through her frequent television appearances and was credited with the first successful crossover album, ''I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues,'' in 1960, died on Saturday in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 82.         She lived in Cliffside Park, N.J., but was taken to a nursing home in Park Ridge last week as circulatory ailments worsened.         From the start, Ms. Farrell was determined to have a singing career on her own terms. Her attitude exasperated many opera buffs, particularly Wagner fans, who heard in her enormous voice the Isolde and BrÃ¼nnhilde of the future. She sang those roles tantalizingly in excerpted concert performances of ''Tristan und Isolde'' and ''GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung'' with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein, but never sang them in the opera house.         Ms. Farrell's belated debut in opera came in 1956, when she appeared as Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' in Tampa, Fla. For her long-awaited Metropolitan Opera debut in 1960 she sang the title role of Gluck's ''Alceste'' in a new production. The ovation she received, with 22 curtain calls, created an ''ear-splitting din,'' said an account in The Saturday Review. But her association with the Met lasted only five years, and she was underutilized.         The problems stemmed partly from her chilly relationship with Rudolf Bing, the Met's autocratic general manager. Bing, who was never comfortable with easygoing American personalities, found Ms. Farrell's irreverence hard to deal with. Down-to-earth and plain-spoken, she liked hanging out with the stagehands and was fond of trading off-color jokes. She did not help herself by publicly dismissing the genre of opera in several interviews, once describing Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' as ''a real nothing.''         Tough and stout of frame, Ms. Farrell was comfortable with herself and confident onstage. But she was impatient with the pretentiousness of the opera world and never embraced it fully. Her work in popular music, radio and television also tainted her in the eyes of many impresarios, though today a singer with such media appeal would be prized by any opera company.         If Ms. Farrell never fulfilled her potential in opera, she had an important career as a recitalist and vocal soloist with orchestras. One of her lasting contributions to opera is the recording of a now-historic 1951 Carnegie Hall concert performance of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos, with Ms. Farrell as a searing Marie and Mack Harrell in the title role.         Ms. Farrell was renowned for the sheer size of her voice. Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times once remarked that Ms. Farrell, singing in Carnegie Hall, could probably be heard in downtown Newark. In his book ''The American Opera Singer,'' the critic Peter G. Davis recounts a story of Ms. Farrell's first performances with the powerhouse tenor Franco Corelli in ''La Forza del Destino'' in Philadelphia. After one duet, Mr. Corelli raced offstage shouting in Italian: ''Who is this woman? She has made me deaf!''         Though at full volume Ms. Farrell's voice could fill any opera house, her sound was never strident or forced. She could modulate her voice beautifully to float lovely pianissimos that still had a penetrating warmth and vibrancy. Her vocal technique was solid, complete with quite passable coloratura agility for bel canto roles like Queen Elizabeth in Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda,'' which she sings memorably opposite Beverly Sills in the title role on a recently reissued 1971 recording. When Ms. Farrell sang pop and jazz standards, she deftly adapted her voice, dipping into a contraltolike low register and bending phrases with smoky lyricism and clear, natural diction.         Ms. Farrell was born on Feb. 13, 1920, in Willimantic, Conn. Her parents were vaudeville performers, Catherine and Michael, the Singing O'Farrells, as they often called themselves. From them Ms. Farrell received her early musical training. Later she studied in New York with Merle Alcock, a Met contralto, and Eleanor McLellan, a vocal and opera coach. Her career began in 1940 when, just 20, she had her own weekly CBS radio program, ''Eileen Farrell Presents,'' in which she offered listeners a populist repertory of arias and light classical works with Irish ballads and Broadway standards mixed in.         The program lasted seven years, by which time Ms. Farrell's voice was one of the most recognized in the United States. All her life she prized a tape recording she had of herself and Frank Sinatra, in a guest appearance on her show, singing ''People Will Say We're in Love.''         In 1946 she married a New York police officer, Robert Reagan. He died in 1986. She is survived by their children, Robert Jr., of Boynton Beach, Fla., and Kathleen Reagan of Washington Township, N.J.; and her brother, John, of Newburyport, Mass.         The conductor Leopold Stokowski gave a boost to Ms. Farrell's classical career when, having heard her sing on radio, he invited her to record Wagner's ''Wesendonk'' lieder with him. Stokowski was on the podium when Ms. Farrell made her New York Philharmonic debut in 1949. In 1950 Mitropoulos, eager to reach audiences beyond Carnegie Hall, asked Ms. Farrell to join him for some concerts at the Roxy Theater, an old vaudeville house that had become a movie palace, singing programs of light classics and arias.         In the 1950's, when Ms. Farrell had all the concert engagements she could possibly want and was enjoying her regular work with the Bach Aria Group, a respected New York ensemble, she stumbled into one of her greatest popular successes: providing the singing voice for the actress Eleanor Parker in the 1955 film ''Interrupted Melody,'' the story of Marjorie Lawrence, the opera star, and her battle with cancer. The soundtrack covered repertory from Isolde's ''Liebestod'' to Butterfly's ''Un bel dÃ¬'' to ''Waltzing Matilda.'' A subsequent recording was a top seller.         The same year as her 1956 opera debut in Tampa, Ms. Farrell made her San Francisco Opera debut in ''Il Trovatore'' with Jussi Bjorling, returning in 1958 as Cherubini's ''Medea,'' a landmark performance of a work then little-known. After her Met debut she returned in ''La Gioconda,'' ''La Forza del Destino,'' ''Cavalleria'' and ''Andrea ChÃ©nier,'' the last with Mr. Corelli and Robert Merrill, one of Ms. Farrell's best pals at the Met, she used to say.         During these years, though, she continued to appear frequently on the television variety shows of Garry Moore, Jonathan Winters and Carol Burnett, among others. She would sing, chat and take part in sketches.         In the mid-1970's Ms. Farrell cut back on performing and began teaching classical and popular voice at Indiana State University.         Reflecting on her work in her 1999 autobiography, ''Can't Help Singing,'' written with Brian Kellow, a critic and the features editor of Opera News, Ms. Farrell wrote: ''In some ways I'm not sure I was suited to the career I had -- nothing in my background had really prepared me for how to handle it. I'm so grateful that most of the time I was able to keep it at arm's length.''         Correction:  March 26, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary of the dramatic soprano Eileen Farrell yesterday misidentified the university where she taught voice in the 1970's. It was Indiana University at Bloomington, not Indiana State.         The obituary also misstated the illness central to the plot of the film ''Interrupted Melody,'' in which Ms. Farrell provided the singing voice for the actress Eleanor Parker, as the soprano Marjorie Lawrence. The film depicted Ms. Lawrence's battle with polio, not cancer.         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of the dramatic soprano Eileen Farrell on Monday misstated the origin of the old Roxy Theater in New York, where she gave some concerts in 1950. It was built as a movie palace; it had not been a vaudeville house.       
         Marion Countess DÃ¶nhoff, an architect of German postwar journalism, over which she still towered as joint publisher of the liberal weekly Die Zeit, died yesterday. She was 92 and lived in Hamburg, where the highly influential intellectual newspaper is published.         She was born into Prussian nobility and was one of the last prominent survivors of the German resistance to Hitler, whose executioners decimated the circle of her friends.         Dr. DÃ¶nhoff -- the countess, as she was known in and out of the office -- was a best-selling author whose essays and commentary were respected well beyond Germany, where she made her mark after Nazism collapsed in defeat in 1945.         In 1946, she joined the political staff of the fledgling Die Zeit, newly licensed by the British occupation authority. Its editors had noted her reports on the Nuremberg trials of Hitler's helpmates and her attempts to show the Allies that there had, in fact, been a German resistance to the Nazi dictator.         In 1955, she was promoted to head the political department of the weekly, which is noted as much for its coverage of culture and the economy as for its scrutiny of government. She also became an assistant editor in chief.         She was named editor in chief in 1968, then a rare distinction for a woman in journalism, particularly in West Germany. Four years later, she rose to publisher, a position she shared with Helmut Schmidt, the former chancellor, among others.         Dr. DÃ¶nhoff was a liberal in the European tradition, a conservative who believed that capitalism needed to be ''civilized'' by a social conscience. She was a force for German reunification and, as someone with roots in the German lands to the east lost after 1945, a strong supporter of Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik of rapprochement with the country's neighbors to the east.         Yet she raised an early voice for Germany's acceptance of its truncated eastern borders when most Germans had yet to reconcile themselves to them. Her stand was especially remarkable in light of her personal history.         Marion Hedda Ilse GrÃ¤fin DÃ¶nhoff was born on a large estate, an heiress to Schloss Friedrichstein, one of the finest castles in East Prussia. Her forebears had settled there in 1633 as noblemen owing fealty to the German emperor, and her ancestors included diplomats and soldiers.         The young Marion DÃ¶nhoff studied economics in Frankfurt-on-Main, where Nazi sympathizers called her the red countess because of her defiance once they gained power in 1933. She left for Switzerland to earn her doctorate in Basel in 1935 and traveled abroad until called home in 1937 to help administer the family estates.         She led a double life with other titled members of the resistance. She herself was interrogated by the Gestapo and released.         As East Prussia was overrun by the Soviet Army, Schloss Friedrichstein was destroyed, and the countess undertook a grueling flight on horseback to Hamburg.         Most of East Prussia was incorporated into the Soviet Union and made a prohibited military zone. It was only in 1989, with the Soviet empire crumbling, that the countess was able to return to her birthplace.         She was the author of many books, some of which appeared in foreign translations. They included ''Before the Storm: Memories of my Youth in Old Prussia,'' published by Knopf in New York in 1990.         The countess, who never married, left no immediate survivors.         ''It's a lost world,'' she said of her journey home. ''I had the intention of never going back there, because it was a terribly beautiful place, a very beautiful manor, from a wonderful period, and I didn't want to see all that destroyed and gone.''       
         Terry Ferrer, a former education editor at Newsweek magazine and The New York Herald Tribune, died on Feb. 12 in Charlottesville, Va., where she lived in retirement. She was 82.         The cause was a thoracic aneurysm, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Miss Ferrer attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart and the Brearley School before graduating cum laude in medieval Latin from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in 1940. After graduation, she was a Latin tutor at Brearley while studying music.         She joined the staff of Newsweek as an office girl in 1942 but soon became a researcher; during World War II, she began to receive writing assignments.         In 1945, Miss Ferrer was named Newsweek's religion editor. She kept that position while also serving as education editor beginning in 1947. In 1957, The Herald Tribune appointed her education editor.         As an editor at the weekly magazine and then at the daily paper she wrote and lectured widely on religion and education.         After The Herald Tribune ceased publication in 1966, she lived in semiretirement but also did occasional consulting work on education for various organizations.         Miss Ferrer is survived by a sister, Dr. M. Irene Ferrer of Manhattan; and a brother, Mel Ferrer, the actor, film director and producer, of Carpinteria, Calif.       
         Indra Devi, the daughter of European nobility who introduced the ancient discipline of yoga to the Kremlin leadership, Hollywood stars like Gloria Swanson and even students in India, died on Thursday in Buenos Aires. She was 102.         In Buenos Aires, where she had lived for several years, she formed a yoga foundation that was named after her.         Known to her followers as Mataji, which means mother, she was a student of Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, the legendary guru who gained worldwide attention for stopping his heartbeat for two minutes. At a time when yoga was almost an exclusively masculine pursuit, she was his first female student.         Like two of his other students, B.K.S. Ayengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, both men, she took his essential teachings and built a style of yoga accessible to Westerners. It was characterized by gentleness.         ''She herself became a kind of seminal figure,'' said Phil Catalto, a senior editor of Yoga Journal. ''She was an ambassador of yoga.''         She was born Eugenie Peterson in Riga, Latvia, on May 12, 1899. Her father was a Swedish bank director, and her mother was a Russian noblewoman. She attended drama school in Moscow as a girl, and escaped to Berlin with her mother when the Communists came to power in 1917.         In Berlin, she became an actress and dancer. Her fascination with India began at 15, when she read a book by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, then some books on yoga. In 1927, she sailed for India.         Under the stage name Indra Devi, she became a rising star in Indian films. In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, commercial attachÃ© to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Bombay. Through him, she met the Maharaja and Maharini of Mysore, who maintained a yoga school in their palace where Sri Krishnamacharya taught.         She asked the master for a lesson. He refused, on the grounds that she was a Westerner and a woman. But she persuaded the royal couple to prevail upon the guru, and he reluctantly consented, said Fernando Pages Ruiz, a freelance writer who interviewed her.         Rather than the cursory lessons he had at first intended, Sri Krishnamacharya taught her for a year. When he learned that her husband was to be transferred to China, he trained her to be a yoga teacher.         In Shanghai, she taught what was thought to be the first yoga class in modern China, Mr. Ruiz said. Her husband, she said in a 1996 interview in Yoga Journal, was ''dead set against'' her yoga courses. It was also the time of the Japanese occupation.         For a time she held five classes of 25 students a day in the bedroom of Madame Chiang Kaishek, wife of the nationalist leader and a new yoga enthusiast.         After the war, she returned to India and wrote her first book, believed to be the first book on yoga written by a Westerner to be published in India. She also became known as the first Westerner to teach yoga there.         Her husband, meanwhile, had been ordered back to Czechoslovakia, where he died in 1946.         She returned to Shanghai to recover their belongings and was unsure whether to go to India or the United States. She bought tickets for both destinations and resolved to take whichever ship sailed first. America won.         She found her way to Hollywood, arriving in January 1947. She discovered ready students among movie stars, who found yoga's breathing and relaxation techniques useful to their work. Her students included Miss Swanson, to whom she dedicated one of her 12 books, Robert Ryan, Greta Garbo, Jennifer Jones and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin.         She taught yoga for at Elizabeth Arden's spas in Maine and Arizona, but refused to join the staff.         In 1953, she married Dr. Siegrid Knauer, who preferred preventive medicine to antibiotics. After becoming an American citizen, she legally changed her name to Indra Devi.         Dr. Knauer bought her a 24-room estate in Tecate, Mexico, at which to give training courses for yoga teachers. He died in 1977.         In 1960, India's ambassador to Moscow arranged for her to meet the top Soviet leaders, including Aleksei Kosygin, the premier, Andrei Gromyko, the foreign minister, and Anastas Mikoyan, chairman of the Supreme Soviet. After she spoke to them of the benefits of yoga, it was legalized in Russia.         In 1966, she became captivated by the teachings of the guru Satya Sai Baba. This resulted in a new form of yoga that she called Sai Yoga.         She traveled and taught around the world. In 1982, she visited Argentina, where her popularity snowballed after a single television appearance. She formed a foundation to spread her yoga methods. At the time of her death, it operated six studios.         ''She was like a national treasure,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''It wasn't just yoga, she was known by the population at large.''         She had no children by either marriage. A woman at her foundation who identified herself only as Anna said that she had an adopted daughter named Rosita.       
         Nancy White, the white-gloved editor of Harper's Bazaar during the 1960's, when it captured the spirit of the decade with evocative photographs of models in bikinis, boots and big watches, not to mention spacesuits, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Miss White edited Harper's from 1958 to 1971, at a time when there were only two major women's fashion magazines in America. The other, Vogue, was headed by Diana Vreeland, a far more visible personality.         Her magazine reflected the cultural upheavals of the 1960's, as did she, up to a point: through her three marriages, she insisted on being called Miss White, reflecting the stylishly independent image she strove to project.         ''There were not a lot of female businesspeople then,'' said Katharine Delahaye Paine, her daughter. ''She felt it was important to create the right image.''         When she assumed the top editorial job at Harper's Bazaar in 1958, Miss White jotted down the words she hoped would describe her magazine. As given in the book ''Harper's Bazaar: 100 Years of the American Female'' (Random House, 1967), they were: ''authority, awareness, wit, spirit, surprise, curiosity, intelligence, timing, food for thought, vitality, balance and youth.''         She emphasized photographs -- many by Richard Avedon and Hiro -- that told the story of a new era. They varied from a model posed in front of a missile at Cape Canaveral, to an ethereal picture of a woman in a gown floating in a glass ball, to a model in a shimmering body stocking. Suzy Parker posed in one of the first fashion layouts featuring the bikini.         ''She was one of the grandes dames of her era,'' the designer John Weitz said yesterday. ''She brought taste, charm and a sense of proportion to the game.''         Nancy White was born in Brooklyn on July 25, 1916. Her father was in publishing and became general manager of Hearst magazines.         She attended the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., where she and Katharine Graham, who was to become publisher of The Washington Post, became lifelong friends.         She left Madeira to work during the Depression, her daughter said. At 15, she worked as an errand girl with a magazine, according to an interview with her in The New York Mirror in 1957. (She did not name the magazine.)         She returned to the boarding school, and after graduation became an editorial assistant, or ''glorified errand girl,'' in her words, with the magazine Pictorial Review. Her next job, which lasted 16 years, was with Good Housekeeping magazine, where she started as an assistant in the fashion department and left as fashion editor.         She joined Harper's as an assistant editor in 1957 and was appointed editor at the beginning of 1958. She was chosen by the previous editor, Carmel Snow, who happened to be her aunt. Diana Vreeland had been another candidate for the top job; she promptly quit. In 1962, Mrs. Vreeland joined Vogue, becoming a legend in the fashion world, and not incidentally Miss White's principal competitor.         Under Miss White, Harper's was aimed at stylish women in Des Moines and Omaha as well as in New York and San Francisco. In one issue, 14 pages by Hiro showed models' bodies seeming to disintegrate beneath colorful prints. Yet in the same issue, there was page after black-and-white page of elegantly understated suits and coats.         Her comments on pantsuits in a 1964 interview in The New York Times reflected the balance she sought between modernity and moderation. Although she would not wear one to the office herself, she said, pantsuits would be all right for her staff members if they wore ''perfect accessories.''         Miss White resigned in 1971 after James W. Brady, formerly publisher of Women's Wear Daily, was appointed publisher and editorial director of Harper's. Mr. Brady said it was Hearst's decision for him to modernize the magazine.         ''In all candor, I don't think Nancy White was as significant as Vreeland,'' said Mr. Brady, the author and columnist, who succeeded Miss White as editor of Harper's. ''She always seemed to be wearing white gloves with her hat firmly in place.''         After her resignation, Miss White advised Bergdorf Goodman on fashion for two years and devoted much of the rest of her life to charities, including Lighthouse for the Blind and the public television station WNET.         She was first married to Clarence Dauphinot, founder of Deltec International, then to Ralph D. Paine Jr., publisher of Fortune magazine, and then George K. Thompson, her high school sweetheart. The first two marriages ended in divorce, and Mr. Thompson died in 1996.         She is survived by two daughters, Ms. Paine of Durham, N.H., and Gillette Piper of Coral Gables, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Mimi Thompson of Manhattan; a sister, Carmel Eitt of King George, Va.; a brother, John Michael White of Delray Beach, Fla.; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 1972, Miss White said she did not own a little black dress. But she had a color scheme for each of her four homes.         ''In Manhattan, I'm sort of white and beige,'' she said. ''In Connecticut, I'm yellow and orange and bright green. In New Hampshire, I'm red and white and navy. In Vermont, I'm beige and red.''       
         Mildred Wirt Benson, who wrote 23 of the first 30 Nancy Drew novels -- those spine-chilling tales of the fearless teenage sleuth who motored about in a blue roadster solving crimes -- died on Tuesday in Toledo, Ohio. She was 96.         Nancy Drew, seldom just Nancy, inspired readers, many of them envious girls, to scoop up more than 80 million copies of the books in the series. Here was a heroine who could survive being beaten, choked and tossed into car trunks; escape spiders and snakes -- and then retire at night in her four-poster bed in a golden bedroom. She dated the athletic Ned and basked in the attentions of her doting, widowed father, the distinguished lawyer Carson Drew. And she had no mother to interfere with her adventures.         Mrs. Benson, her anonymous ghostwriter, took a title and few sentences of outline and turned them into 200-page novels, once churning out 13 in one year, when she was also working full time as a newspaper reporter. She generally got $125 a book, plus Christmas bonuses, and signed away all rights to royalties and personal recognition.         To her readers, she was Carolyn Keene, one of at least two and perhaps as many as six writers who used that pseudonym for the original 56 Nancy Drew Mystery Stories; some of the originals are still in print, republished by Applewood Books. But as the author of the very first one, ''The Secret of the Old Clock'' (Grosset & Dunlap, 1930), it was she who defined the character.         In an interview with Salon, an online magazine, in 1999, she described Nancy as a person who believed in her own freedom. ''The girls were ripe for a change in literature,'' she said. ''They were way overdue for a good, entertaining story that broke away from the old style of writing. I think Nancy was the character the girls were waiting for.''         In 1993, the University of Iowa, where Mrs. Benson in 1927 was the first person to earn a master's in journalism, held a symposium to discuss the importance of Nancy Drew. Catharine R. Stimpson, a professor at Rutgers, said then in an interview with The New York Times that what matters in the books ''is not her sex appeal but how tough and smart and adventurous she is.'' She continued: ''It means something that mothers and aunts give books to their nieces and daughters. She's a legacy, a spiritual treasure passed on.''         Mildred Augustine was born on July 10, 1905, in Ladora, Iowa. The daughter of a doctor, she detested dolls, and her earliest ambition was to be a writer.         After graduating from the University of Iowa in 1925, she worked for a year for a newspaper in Clinton, Iowa. She then went to New York City, where she met Edward Stratemeyer, a book packager who employed a stable of anonymous writers called the Stratemeyer Syndicate to produce series of fiction books, which he would sell to publishers. Among the series his book factory produced were the ''Bobbsey Twins,'' ''Tom Swift'' and the ''Hardy Boys.'' She left a writing sample and returned to the University of Iowa for graduate work. Stratemeyer wrote to offer her a chance to write for his faltering ''Ruth Fielding'' series.         She was then offered a chance to write the first Nancy Drew book. In a biographical essay, she said it was harder than it seemed, even if she did not have to come up with the plot.         ''The plots provided me were brief, yet certain hackneyed names and situations could not be bypassed,'' she wrote. ''Therefore I concentrated upon Nancy, trying to make her a departure from the stereotyped heroine commonly encountered in the series books of the day.''         She wrote that Mr. Stratemeyer was bitterly disappointed with the first one, saying the heroine was ''too flip.'' But it and the next two books were huge financial successes; she wrote two more by the end of the year.         Mrs. Benson worked on several other projects for the syndicate. She published several other books under her own pseudonyms, as well as many books under her real name. Sometimes she imagined things that became part of her own life later on. Except for one bumpy ride with a barnstormer, she had never flown when she wrote the ''Ruth Darrow Flying Stories.'' She later took flying lessons and became a commercial pilot and aviation columnist.         She was introduced to journalism through her first husband, Asa Wirt, who worked for The Associated Press. In 1944, she began working at The Toledo Times and later moved to The Toledo Blade. Mr. Wirt died in 1947, and three years later she married George Benson, editor of The Toledo Times, who died in 1959. Her only survivor is her daughter, Margaret Wirt of Logansport, Ind.         She covered city hall and the courts, among other beats. She worked until the day she died, being taken to the hospital from her desk, where she had been working on her monthly column about older people.         Her fiction writing slowed to a halt in the mid-1960's. She rejected a request to bring her Nancy Drew style to bear on drug abuse and other social problems.         But Mrs. Benson could not escape Nancy Drew, even when others took the credit. Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, the daughter of the syndicate's founder, for years said that she alone was the author of Nancy Drew. Her plausible argument was that she had outlined the plot ideas, and then edited Mrs. Benson's manuscripts with a thoroughness that sometimes angered the author. There are experts on both sides of this question.         Literary scholars have also delved into Nancy Drew, finding racism, class snobbery and, most surprising to the author, lesbianism. ''This is the silliest, most out-of-the-picture thing I've ever heard,'' Mrs. Benson said of that idea. ''I'd like to blow a cork!''         As the author confided to a reporter from The New York Times on the way to the Iowa conference, it can all sometimes add up to being a bit much. ''I'm so sick of Nancy Drew I could vomit,'' Mrs. Benson said.       
         Lois Gould, a best-selling novelist, essayist and memoirist known for her acutely observed portrayals of the emotional complexities of women's lives, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         She had fought cancer for some time, said her son, Anthony C. Gould.         Ms. Gould was perhaps best known for her debut novel, ''Such Good Friends'' (1970, Random House). Partly autobiographical, the book is about a woman who learns of her husband's wide-ranging infidelities only as he is dying in a hospital. It spent seven weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and was released as a film the next year.         Most recently, Ms. Gould published a critically praised memoir, ''Mommy Dressing: A Love Story, After a Fashion'' (Anchor/Doubleday, 1998), a cleareyed recollection of life with her glamorous, remote mother, the fashion designer Jo Copeland. Reviewing the memoir in The New York Times Book Review, Margo Jefferson wrote that ''dispassionate compassion is a very moving quality, and it marks 'Mommy Dressing' from beginning to end.''         As an essayist and critic, Ms. Gould was a frequent contributor to The Times, writing the inaugural Hers column in 1977 and many thereafter. Her subjects included sexual politics, family and the seemingly unbridgeable gulf between men's and women's attitudes toward emotionally laden topics like adultery, eroticism and divorce.         Ms. Gould was born Lois Regensburg to parents ensconced in the Stork Club set of Manhattan. Her father, Edward J. Regensburg Jr., a debonair cigar manufacturer, left the family, ''whistling,'' she would write, when Lois was 3. Her mother, whose designs were prized by the social lights of New York, Hollywood and Europe, was consumed by her passion for her work and her distaste for her children.         As parties rustled silkenly in Jo Copeland's Park Avenue living room -- guests might include Joan Crawford or Tyrone Power -- Lois and her brother were expected to remain in their rooms with their supper trays, blissfully unseen and unheard.         After graduating from Wellesley, Ms. Gould reported on the criminal courts for The Long Island Star-Journal, a newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that has since folded. She became an editor on several national magazines and served as executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal. She married Philip Benjamin, a novelist and a reporter for The Times, in 1955.         In 1966 her husband died suddenly after surgery, leaving her with two boys. Among her husband's papers, Ms. Gould found a diary written in code. She cracked the code and discovered a catalog of his extramarital liaisons, many with her friends. The experience provided a foundation for her first novel.         In ''Such Good Friends,'' Julie Messinger, a young mother, uncovers a similar diary as her husband lies dying. Ms. Gould's novel offered a raw, darkly comic portrait of Julie's emotional life -- her grief, rage, amphetamine popping and suicidal depression -- along with frank depictions of her sexual life, which ran the gamut from quiet marital frustration to ardent masturbation.         The book caused a sensation in 1970, when Americans were still struggling to comprehend the social upheavals set in motion by the women's movement.         Likening Julie to a female Alex Portnoy, Saturday Review said: ''What some men find offensive in 'Such Good Friends' is just this kind of intimate disclosure'': the passage under critical scrutiny involved reading Krafft-Ebing in bed while eating Sara Lee fudge cake. The review continued, ''Women aren't supposed to have equal sexual and human rights -- and talk about them as openly as men.''         In 1967 Ms. Gould married the psychiatrist Robert E. Gould. (Her sons, whom Dr. Gould adopted, took his surname.) Dr. Gould died n 1998; Ms. Gould's son Roger V. Gould, a sociologist at Yale University, died of leukemia at 39 on April 29. Ms. Gould is survived by her son Anthony, of Manhattan, and her brother, Anthony Regensburg, of Camden, Me., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Among Ms. Gould's other books are the novels ''Necessary Objects'' (1972), ''Final Analysis'' (1974), ''A Sea Change'' (1976) and ''La Presidenta'' (1981) and the essay collection ''Not Responsible for Personal Articles'' (1978).         If Ms. Gould was known primarily for her knife-edged fictional depictions of marriage and its discontents, she was an equally incisive observer of human connection -- and disconnection -- in her nonfiction.         In an evocative passage about her mother, she recalled a bittersweet childhood ritual: watching Jo Copeland at her vanity table as she prepared for an evening out.         ''It seemed to me an ark of some covenant, with hidden doors that swung open to reveal fragrant jars and beautiful bottles, each of which held other secrets,'' she wrote.         ''Everything I knew about my mother, Jo Copeland, happened right there,'' Ms. Gould continued. ''For what I knew about her was only the dressing. Nothing of the rest of her life was visible to me. Unless the dressing was, in fact, the life.''       
         Sharon Anne Hogan, a Chicago university librarian who helped usher the country's libraries into the electronic age, died on April 27 while convalescing with friends in Paradise Valley, Ariz. She was 57 and lived in suburban Oak Brook.         The cause was cancer, said the University of Illinois, where she had been a librarian since 1990. Ms. Hogan left Chicago on Feb. 14 to attend a conference and was stopping over in Arizona on her way back when she fell ill, the university reported.         Ms. Hogan was a national leader in getting libraries to function as information retrieval systems. To that end she devised a system to teach library users the basics of the Internet so they could perform some of their own research.         ''Sharon Hogan was a pivotal figure in the rebirth of the modern library in the digital age,'' said the university chancellor, Sylvia Manning.         In legislative hearings and other forums she championed copyright, free speech and privacy rights. She testified before Congress on technology and access issues.         The Illinois Library Association gave her its Intellectual Freedom Award for opposing Internet filters and state legislation that would have left obscenity standards to individual counties. Such laws, she argued, would hamper libraries in lending materials across county lines.         The national Association of College and Research Libraries named her its Academic/Research Librarian of the Year in 2000. She was co-author of a textbook, ''Learning the Library'' (Bowker, 1982), and the founding editor of the journal Research Strategies.         Sharon Hogan grew up in Cherokee, Iowa, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the College of William and Mary in 1967. She then received an advanced degree in library science at the University of Michigan.         She held positions there, at Temple University and at Louisiana State University, where she became director of libraries. The University of Illinois recruited her in 1990 with the additional title of vice provost for information management, dealing with computing, telecommunications and information systems.         Ms. Hogan is survived by her mother, Elta Hogan of Cherokee. Her husband, Theodore J. Martineau, died in 2000.         ''Libraries,'' she said when she received her Intellectual Freedom Award, ''play a very important role in safeguarding every citizen's right to read or hear diverse viewpoints and to make up his or her own mind about issues.''       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancÃ©e jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Zena Sutherland, the most prominent reviewer of American children's books for nearly three decades and the author of five editions of ''Children and Books,'' the classic textbook on the subject, died on June 12 in Chicago. She was 86.         As the editor and reviewer of The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, essentially a one-woman operation, she concisely assessed about 30,000 titles, more than 100 a month, from 1958 to 1985. The Bulletin is directed to librarians, but her words were also taken seriously by editors, publishers, writers and illustrators.         ''No other individual's views had such an impact on children's books then or now,'' said Roger Sutton, the editor of The Horn Book magazine and one of her many protÃ©gÃ©s.         Mrs. Sutherland led the way in the critical rather than sugary descriptive reviewing that accompanied the flourishing of American children's books. She explained the great change in the field of children's books that paralleled her career as the lifting of taboos, most of which reflected a sincere wish to protect children. She accepted children as real and aware individuals and their books as real literature, and she was a stalwart supporter of books that addressed a range of problems and issues that some still find shocking.         In 1963 the psychologically incisive picture book ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' by Maurice Sendak, was controversial in the way it depicted a child's temper tantrum. Mrs. Sutherland found it ''most imaginative and unusual.'' Her 1970 review of Mr. Sendak's ''In the Night Kitchen'' serenely sailed past little Mickey's brief nudity, which so disturbed other reviewers, and described the book as an ''engaging fantasy.''         Mr. Sendak remembered both her criticism and her friendship as ''a magnifying glass.'' He added, ''You couldn't lie or be sappy or ridiculous.''         Of John Donovan's ''I'll Get There. It Better Be Worth the Trip,'' a 1969 novel for young adults that introduced homosexuality as a theme, she said, ''It is not the crux of the story, and it is handled with dignity.'' Similarly, in 1974 she identified Robert Cormier's first novel, ''The Chocolate War,'' now considered a classic, as ''a sobering, dramatic and timeless story.''         Zena Karras was born in Winthrop, Mass., in 1915 and moved with her mother to Chicago after her parents divorced. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1937, married Roland Bailey the same year and had three children. In 1956 she began course work at the Graduate Library School with the vague intention of becoming a medical librarian, took a children's literature course on a whim and was soon asked to take over The Bulletin temporarily.         Mrs. Sutherland also reviewed children's books for The Saturday Review from 1966 to 1972 and for The Chicago Tribune from 1972 to 1984. She taught at the Library School from 1972 to 1986 and served on all the important library and children's book committees, including those for the Newbery and Caldecott Awards.         She succeeded May Hill Arbuthnot as the author of ''Children and Books,'' the basic college text on children's literature, in 1972, and revised it regularly, most recently in 1996.         Her friendship with Scott O'Dell, the author of ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' and other historical novels for children, led to the establishment in 1981 of the $5,000 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, of which she was the permanent chairwoman.         In 1983 a collection of articles in her honor, ''Celebrating Children's Books,'' generated royalties that were used to establish the Zena Sutherland lecture series, now run by the Chicago Public Library and the University of Chicago Lab School.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1961. In 1964 she married Alec Sutherland, a Scot who was then director of broadcasting at the University of Chicago. He died in 1990.         Her survivors include a daughter, Katherine Linehan, a professor of English at Oberlin College; two sons, Stephen Bailey, associate dean and professor of history at Knox College, and Thomas Bailey, a teacher in Hellenbaek, Denmark; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         ''I love reading and I love reviewing,'' Mrs. Sutherland once said in an interview. ''Opening every single package was like Christmas. I have been known to stop in the middle of unpacking a load of books and sit down with one.''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancÃ©'s father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago.

Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of good will to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going. ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own. A 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         While her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-protection organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research. ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955. ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' she said in 1990. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancÃ©e jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Caroline Knapp, a writer and columnist whose memoir ''Drinking: A Love Story'' vividly chronicled her struggle to overcome alcoholism, died yesterday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 42 and lived in Cambridge.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         In ''Drinking'' Ms. Knapp wrote about the disturbing incongruities of her life as what she called a ''high-functioning alcoholic'': she was an award-winning journalist, an Ivy League graduate from a well-to-do New England family and by all appearances a happy, healthy and successful young woman. But drinking had slowly taken hold of her life, and she was desperate to conceal its effects.         She was, she wrote, ''smooth and ordered on the outside; roiling and chaotic and desperately secretive underneath, but not noticeably so, never noticeably so.''         The book, published by Dial Press in 1996, was praised by critics for its painful honestly in describing the grip of addiction and the difficulty of overcoming it. In a review in The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called it ''a remarkable exercise in self-discovery.'' The book remained on The New York Times best-seller list for several weeks in both hardcover and paperback editions.         In ''Drinking'' Ms. Knapp characterized her addiction as a bad love affair. In her next book, she found a healthier relationship. ''I am in love with my dog,'' she wrote near the beginning of ''Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs'' (Dial Press, 1998).         ''I'm 38 and I'm single,'' she continued, ''and I'm having my most intense and gratifying relationship with a dog. But we all learn about love in different ways, and this way happens to be mine.''         ''Pack of Two'' was also a best-seller and, like ''Drinking,'' it commingled autobiography with nonfiction in its passages on dog rearing and pet-inspired self-analysis like ''I understand the impulse to romanticize the dog; I struggle with it myself.''         Ms. Knapp developed her style in her years as a columnist at The Boston Phoenix, an alternative weekly newspaper where she worked from 1988 to 1995 and to which she continued to contribute until 1999. Her ''Out There'' column, in which she often wrote about the travails in life and love of a semifictional 30-something single woman named Alice K. -- ''not her real initial'' -- was one of the paper's most popular features and won her an Alternative Newsweekly Award in 1996. She was often light and humorous in the paper, but could be poignantly confessional, as in a memorable column about her struggles with anorexia.         Her columns, were collected in 1994 in the book ''Alice K.'s Guide to Life: One Woman's Quest for Survival, Sanity and the Perfect New Shoes'' (Dutton/Plume).         Ms. Knapp graduated with honors from Brown University and worked as a reporter for The Boston Business Journal before joining at The Phoenix, where she was a features writer and later the lifestyle editor.         Her lung cancer was diagnosed in mid-April, and on May 11 she married Mark Morelli. She had recently completed work on a book about women's appetites.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Rebecca, of West Boylston, Mass.; and a brother, Andrew, of Salem, Mass.       
         Charlotte Schuchardt Read, the former director of the Institute of General Semantics, an educational center and publisher in Brooklyn, died on July 25 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. She was 92.         General semantics, a branch of linguistics founded by Alfred Korzybski in the 1930's and popularized by S. I. Hayakawa in his book ''Language in Action'' (1941), theorizes that words are abstractions that draw attention away from the particularity of the things they represent. It advocates a critical awareness of language, a process that can lead to a rejection of stereotypes and a deeper experience of reality, and has been adopted as a technique by a number of psychological movements.         Ms. Read joined the institute in 1939 when it was based in Chicago, and was executive secretary to Mr. Korzybski before his death in 1950. In 1953, she married Allen Walker Read, a linguist who is now professor emeritus of English at Columbia University, and moved the institute to New York.         In addition to her duties as director, she was editor of and a contributor to the General Semantics Bulletin. She was also a director and president of the Sensory Awareness Foundation of Mill Valley, Calif.         Ms. Read was born on Dec. 7, 1909, in Belleville, Ill. She studied biology at the University of Wisconsin and received a master's degree in modern dance from the University of Illinois.       
         Emily Genauer, an art critic who championed 20th-century painting and sculpture over the course of a four-decade newspaper career and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, died on Friday after a long illness. She was 91.         Starting out as the critic for The New York World in the 1930's, Ms. Genauer made it her mission to introduce modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to a newspaper audience. She also staunchly defended art's independence from politics. In 1949, she left The New York World-Telegram after an argument with its owner, Roy W. Howard, who thought she was paying too much attention to artists he considered ''Communists and left-wingers,'' like Pablo Picasso.         Ms. Genauer's columns for The New York Herald Tribune, where she was chief art critic from 1949 to 1966, were also watched closely by artists. In 1992 she recalled how the painter Clyfford Still, about whom she had written unfavorably, sent her a pair of rubber baby pants with a card. The card read: ''Hoping this will aid in concealing your Sunday affliction. With the compliments of Clyfford Still.''         She tried to promote lesser-known artists. While visiting the East Side town house of John Hay Whitney, the owner of The Herald Tribune, she urged him to purchase more 20th-century art. She took him to a communal studio-gallery of avant-garde artists on the Bowery, directly opposite that neighborhood's leading flophouse. After getting out of his limousine and hesitantly stepping around some drunks, he bought a number of paintings.         The author of numerous books, Ms. Genauer was also a member of the National Council on the Humanities from 1966 to 1970.         Emily Genauer was born July 19, 1911, in Staten Island, where her father owned several delicatessens and was an amateur sculptor. She attended Hunter College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and began writing for The New York World in 1929. She always retained her maiden name as a byline, though after marrying Frederick Gash she took his last name in her private life.         The World paid her by the word, allowing her to make as much as $92 per week, she recalled in 1992. Then she got a call from an editor who told her she was to be paid a salary. ''Aren't you happy?'' the editor asked. ''You're now on staff. Your fee will be $35 a week.''         After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life, and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York City; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''

         Daphne Bayne Hellman, the jazz harpist who performed around the world and for three decades at the Village Gate but who had a special affection for playing on subway platforms, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Manhattan. She was 86.         Ms. Hellman, who had played on the streets of Paris at a music fair as recently as June, was recuperating from injuries suffered in a fall last month near her town house on East 61st Street, her family said.         In a wildly peripatetic musical career that began in the 1940's at Town Hall -- where Time magazine called her ''as curvesome as a treble clef'' -- her professional choices were generally as eccentric as those she made in the rest of her life.         She saw nothing particularly unusual, she said, about plucking her harp on the street in front of the Hotel Pierre, where she came out to society in 1933, at a supper dance in the roof garden.         She did not seem to care what people thought when, after years of playing well-to-do places for well-to-do crowds, she also took the stage at clubs like CBGB, on the Bowery, accompanied by the kitchen-drawer percussion of a man called Mr. Spoons, otherwise known as Joseph Jones Jr., whom Ms. Hellman put up in her town house after his third wife left him.         She played the Beatles or Roger Miller or bluegrass warhorses like ''Foggy Mountain Breakdown'' with as much appreciation as she played Bach and Debussy, Gershwin and Kern.         Although she was an heiress with substantial means -- ''My mother had mucho money,'' she said in one interview -- she liked to count the money she earned when she began playing in the subway in the 1980's, sometimes carrying coins to a delicatessen near her house to trade them for bills.         ''She was just the antisnob, that's what she was,'' said Art D'Lugoff, who owned the Village Gate, where Ms. Hellman and her trio, Hellman's Angels, played every Tuesday for 30 years when she was in town. It was one of the longest nightclub runs in the city's history.         ''She had money and she knew a lot of people and she got along with everybody,'' said Mr. D'Lugoff, whose club closed in 1994. ''She opened up a new world for me, and I opened up a world for her.''         Ms. Hellman was sometimes compared to Katharine Hepburn, not only because of her high cheekbones and patrician good looks, but also because she lived a life of elegant rebellion, even before she first touched a harp at the age of 12.         Born Daphne Van Beuren Bayne, the granddaughter of the founder of the Seaboard National Bank, she recalled in a 1990 profile in The New Yorker that as a child she liked to keep bats and armadillos as pets. ''They are much maligned and misunderstood,'' she said of bats.         As a young woman, she first tried acting, training in New York and London and landing a walk-on part in a Broadway production of ''Hamlet.'' She also modeled for Man Ray and Harper's Bazaar. But after her marriage to her first husband, Harry Bull, the editor of Town & Country magazine, and the birth of their son, Sandy, she began to take the harp more seriously.         Over the strong objections of her father, she had her jazz debut at a cabaret called Le Ruban Bleu, at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue. Over the next few years, she played at a string of clubs that sound like a roll call from another musical era: the Hotel New Yorker, with Ving Merlin and his All-Girl Band; Upstairs at the Downstairs, with Blossom Dearie and Imogene Coca; Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe; the Versailles; Le Perroquet.         Once, at Le Ruban Bleu, according to the New Yorker profile, a young Billie Holiday, quite drunk, angrily refused to share the club's only dressing room with Ms. Hellman, who played there twice a year.         But most of Ms. Hellman's relationships with famous people were much more congenial and enduring. Her cluttered East Side town house, usually full of boarders, birds, dogs and litters of gerbils, served as the base for a kind of floating salon. And she was its musical Zelig, whose close friends included, besides Mr. Spoons, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the artist Saul Steinberg and the writer Norman Mailer.         In the 1940's, she had briefly supplied a beautiful face and high-society name to gossip columns when her marriage to Mr. Bull fell apart and she had an affair with Geoffrey T. Hellman, a writer for The New Yorker. She married him in Reno in 1941, hours after her divorce from Mr. Bull. (Her son, Sandy Bull, a noted guitarist, died last year; she is survived by a daughter, Daisy Paradis, and a son, Digger St. John.)         Mr. Hellman left her for another woman, and in 1961, she married Hsio-Wen Shih, a Chinese-American architect and writer, who left their home one day in 1965 and disappeared, breaking her heart, friends said.         ''It was like he went out for a pack of cigarettes and just didn't come back,'' said Lyn Christie, the bassist in Ms. Hellman's trio, who played with her for decades, everywhere from the subway to Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Bombay and Hong Kong.         ''It felt sort of like the trips we made to China were an attempt to try to find out about him,'' Mr. Christie said. ''But we never did come across him.''         Ms. Hellman's daughter, Daisy Paradis, said that her mother, who sometimes smoked a pack of Salems a day, had slowed down only slightly over the last few years. She had not played the subway for quite a while, mostly because it had become harder to find someone to help her lug her 85-pound harp down to the platform. But she played in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka this year and was appearing at the Firebird Cafe in Midtown at the time of her fall.         ''She was an incredibly intrepid woman,'' said Mr. Christie, who recalled that in Hong Kong she tried to ride on horseback into Communist China. ''She loved to do whatever she knew you weren't supposed to do.''       
         Elizabeth Coblentz, an Amish homemaker who wrote a syndicated cooking column by hand beneath a kerosene lantern, a kitchen chronicle that touched on everything from the merits of Belgian horses to coping with grief, died on Tuesday in Blue Springs, Mo. She was 66.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Kevin Williams, her editor at Oasis Newsfeatures, which distributed her column to 105 newspapers, with more than two million readers.         A member of the strict Old Order Amish, who avoid most modern conveniences, she lived on a farm near Geneva, Ind., without running water, electricity, plumbing or a telephone. She traveled primarily by horse-drawn buggy, sewed her family's clothes and canned fruits and vegetables. She answered questions many readers had never thought to ask, including how to cook a meal for 76 children.         She mailed in her weekly columns, but Mr. Williams sometimes did not have time to mail his editing questions, so he would wire daisies with a card enclosed. One asked: ''How much sugar in that cream pie recipe?'' Mr. Williams had prepaid Express Mail envelopes at her home in which she could reply.         Mrs. Coblentz's columns seemed to be ripped from the pages of a 19th-century church bulletin, with their descriptions of quilting bees, children's funerals, sleigh rides and walking barefoot in warm spring soil. She told of baking 70 pies and 14 plates of ''nothings,'' a traditional Amish pastry, for her daughter's wedding.         In one column -- she called them letters -- she described a day that began at 4 a.m. with cooking breakfast of fried potatoes, eggs and bacon. The 11 a.m. entry: ''Went in to get dinner, as I've got menfolk working hard, hauling loads and loads of manure with the manure spreader that is driven by a team of horses.''         Her religious faith was a constant theme. But food, of the most comfortable kind, was her main topic, from Aunt Hilty's cinnamon rolls to putting up pumpkin pickles to churning a double batch of hot pepper butter. Among her recipes were those for sauerkraut bread, watermelon preserves and dandelion jelly.         The overall effect of her columns was an insight into the way of life and fundamental values of the Amish.         ''You would not notice much difference in our life now from when I was a girl or my mother was a girl,'' Mrs. Coblentz said in an Associated Press interview in 2000.         Elizabeth Coblentz was born in Berne, Ind., on July 18, 1936. She had six sisters and one brother and grew up on a farm. She left school after ninth grade, in accordance with Amish custom. She worked in a sugar factory, cleaned houses and married young. Starting in 1952, she wrote community news for a nationally distributed Amish newspaper.         Mr. Williams discovered her in 1991, after having done a research paper on the Amish as a college freshman. After having the idea of an Amish cooking column, he ran into Mrs. Coblentz by chance.         The first newspaper to take the column was The Quincy Herald-Whig of Quincy, Ill. It now appears in papers from Newton, N.J., to Indianapolis to Tacoma. But Mrs. Coblentz's picture does not appear with it. Following Amish tradition rooted in biblical passages that decry ''graven images,'' she refused to be photographed, appear on television or allow her voice to be taped.         But she had nothing against personal appearances and was on a publicity tour to promote her new book when she died. The book, ''The Amish Cook: Recipes and Recollections From an Old Order Amish Family,'' is to be published in November by Ten Speed Press of Berkeley, Calif. Her earlier work, ''The Best of the Amish Cook,'' a collection of her newspaper columns, was published by Oasis in two volumes.         On her tour, she traveled with Mr. Williams by car, as the Amish faith permits people to use technology as long as it does not intrude on their lives, he said. Owning an auto was out of the question for Mrs. Coblentz, Mr. Williams said, because it would have brought the whole world within her reach. Riding with someone is a compromise most Amish are willing to make, he said.         Her husband, Benjamin, a carpenter, died in 2000, throwing her into a depression that Mr. Williams said he believes led to her death. More than 3,000 readers sent cards and 5,000 sent e-mail messages to the syndicate that distributed her column.         She is survived by her daughters, Leah Shetler, Verena and Susan Coblentz, Elizabeth Wengerd, Lovina Eicher and Emma Schwartz, all of Geneva; her sons, Amos of Berne and Albert of Geneva; her sisters, Leah Girod of Berne, Lovina Swartzentruber of LaGrange, Ind., Emma Schwartz of Berne and Salome Hilty and Barbara Schwartz, both of Geneva; her brother, Chris A. Graber of Bryant, Ind.; and 35 grandchildren.         Many of her readers seemed to feel close to her. In a letter before Mrs. Coblentz's death, Betty Watters of Independence, Mo., wrote, ''Your letters remind me of my mother -- her chickens, gardens, canning, cleaning, working every day in fields by Dad's side and clean-smelling laundry whipping and snapping in the fresh air and sunshine.''

         Tatyana M. Velikanova, a Soviet human rights activist who was a leading editor of the most important samizdat journal of human rights abuses and spent nearly nine years in prison camp and exile, died of cancer on Sept. 19. She was 70 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Velikanova, a mathematician by profession, became a dissident in 1968, when she went to Red Square with her husband, Konstantin Babitsky, who was one of only seven people to demonstrate openly against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring reforms.         Mr. Babitsky was arrested and banished for several years to the far north of Russia. The next year, Ms. Velikanova helped found the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the U.S.S.R., and became the backbone of the Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat news bulletin, after the arrest of its founder, Natalya Gorbanevskaya. The chronicle was the main uncensored source of information about the dissident movement around the Soviet Union during the rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev.         At a time when photocopying machines were rare and kept literally under lock and key in Soviet offices, the compilers of the chronicle gathered information and then produced multiple copies by typing through layers of carbon paper.         The chronicle was written in a dry, telegraphic style, and defended all repressed groups, from Pentecostal believers to Jewish refuseniks, Russian Orthodox priests, Georgian nationalists, deported Crimean Tatars, and intellectuals and religious believers in the Baltic republics.         Ms. Velikanova herself was an observant Orthodox Christian.         She was arrested in 1979 on charges of ''anti-Soviet propaganda,'' and a report in the Chronicle around that time detailed official questioning of her sister about her ties to the West, as well as the interrogator's relaying his prisoner's request for a Bible and photographs of her grandchildren.         Ms. Velikanova received a nine-year sentence, serving four years in prison camp and then being exiled to a desolate part of Kazakhstan.         In a statement written during his own banishment from Moscow to the city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Andrei D. Sakharov lauded Ms. Velikanova for her dedication to the cause of the oppressed, regardless of whether she agreed with their views. ''Her only consideration was whether someone had suffered injustice,'' he wrote.         During the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Ms. Velikanova was allowed to return to Moscow before her nine-year term was fully served. In her final years, she lived out of the public eye, teaching math and Russian language and literature at a Moscow school until just months before her death.         She is survived by three children, Natalie Babitsky of France, Fyodor Babitsky of Moscow and Yulia Keidan of Italy; 13 grandchildren; two brothers, Andrew Velihan of Northport, N.Y., and Kirill Velikanov of Moscow; and two sisters, Yekaterina Velikanova of Moscow and Mary Velihan Grigorenko of New York City.       
         Eileen Jackson Southern, a scholar of Renaissance and African-American music and the first black woman to be appointed a tenured full professor at Harvard University, died on Sunday at her home in Port Charlotte, Fla. She was 82.         As a researcher, author and teacher, Dr. Southern documented the history and scope of African-American contributions to American music. Much of her work remains in print.         ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'' (1971) is in its third edition (Norton, 1997). She also compiled the ''Biographical Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians'' (Greenwood, 1982) and ''The Music of Black Americans'' (Norton, third edition, 1997).         In 1973, with her husband, Prof. Joseph Southern, she founded Black Perspectives in Music, the first musicological journal on the study of black music. She edited the journal until it ceased publication in 1990.         She received a National Humanities Medal in 2001 for having ''helped transform the study and understanding of American music.'' She also received the 2000 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society of American Music.         In a way, Eileen Southern's mission was prompted by a question she encountered while teaching at CUNY's York College in 1968. At issue was the inclusion of music in a black-studies curriculum. She recalled that a colleague asked, ''Besides jazz, what is there?''         Her life's work was meant to give an answer.         She traced the evolution of black choruses from church singing groups, and a startling number of black orchestras like the Negro Philharmonic Society of New Orleans. In the early 1900's, black and white audiences flocked to Carnegie Hall to hear the Clef Club Symphony Orchestra under its conductor James Reese Europe play music by black composers like Harry T. Burleigh and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.         Eileen Jackson was born in Minneapolis and grew up in Chicago. Encouraged by her parents, whose home was a haven for black musicians, she studied piano and made her first concert appearance at age 7. She continued to give concerts on tour while pursuing her academic career and musicological studies until the mid-1950's.         She graduated in 1940 from the University of Chicago, where she received a master's degree the next year. Her thesis was ''The Use of Negro Folksong in Symphonic Form.'' Faced with racial discrimination, she started teaching at traditionally black colleges in Texas and Louisiana.         Moving to New York in 1954, she taught public school before joining the CUNY faculty of Brooklyn College in 1960. She became a full professor in 1972 at York College, where she also served as chairwoman of the music department.         In the 1950's she studied at New York University under the Renaissance music scholar Gustave Reese. She received her Ph.D. in 1961 with a dissertation about Renaissance music. It was published as ''The Buxheim Organ Book'' (Institute of Mediaeval Music, 1963).         Dr. Southern went to Harvard as a lecturer in 1974 and received a dual appointment in Afro-American studies and music in 1976. She headed the department of Afro-American studies from 1975 to 1979 and retired in 1987 as a professor emeritus.         She is survived by her husband of 60 years, Professor Southern; a daughter, April S. Reilly of Florence, Calif.; a son, Edward J., of Port Charlotte; a sister, Stella Hall of Chicago; and three grandchildren.         She was the editor of ''African American Theater: 'Out of Bondage' (1876), and 'Peculiar Sam: or The Underground Railroad' (1879)'' (Garland, 1994). She also wrote, with Dr. Josephine Wright, ''Images: Iconography of Music and Musicians in African-American Culture'' (Garland, 1998). Both are in print.         Dr. Southern remembered her reception at Harvard as far from cordial. In ''A Pioneer,'' an essay she contributed to the 1993 anthology ''Blacks at Harvard,'' she told of years of stress spent gaining respect for herself and the fledgling department she headed.         But she invoked her role model, W. E. B. Du Bois. ''Like him, I went to Harvard because it was a great opportunity for me as a black female scholar, and I accepted the reality of racial and sex discrimination,'' she wrote. ''In its role as nurturer of scholars, Harvard never let me down!''       
         Helen Dudar, a prolific New York journalist and freelance writer on cultural subjects, died on Aug. 1 at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was metastatic breast cancer, her husband, Peter L. Goldman, said.         Ms. Dudar, who grew up on Long Island, started her career at Newsday before working for The New York Post for more than 25 years as a general-assignment reporter, beginning in the early 1950's. She then wrote for The Daily News before becoming a freelance writer for many newspapers and magazines.         She often wrote for the Sunday Arts & Leisure section of The New York Times and for The Wall Street Journal. Her work also appeared in Smithsonian magazine, Esquire, Newsweek, American Film, Connoisseur and Art in America.         Besides her husband of 41 years, a Newsweek contributing editor, Ms. Dudar's survivors include her sister, Nancy Gallanty, of the Bronx.       
         Carole Kismaric, an innovative editor and book packager who helped start the Time-Life Photography Series and for 10 years was editorial director of the Aperture Foundation, a nonprofit publisher of fine-art photography books, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 60.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her sister, Susan Kismaric, said.         While at Aperture, from 1976 to 1985, Ms. Kismaric was a force in changing the face of photography book publishing. At the start of her tenure, books of fine-art photography -- including Aperture's -- generally reproduced one picture per page, without caption or text and surrounded by a frame of white space, as if it were a framed print.         Working with the Aperture designer Wendy Byrne and others, she helped usher in a more flexible, magazine-influenced design approach, in which pictures might be reproduced across two pages and combined with text.         But her purpose was more than a matter of presentation: she sought to demonstrate how books of artistically bold pictures could also yield social and political meanings beyond the purview of art and thus appeal to broad audiences.         To further demonstrate how thoroughly photographs are ingrained in contemporary culture, in 1991 she joined with Marvin Heiferman, an independent curator and writer, to create Lookout, a partnership that developed and produced exhibitions and publications.         Among the exhibitions Lookout produced were ''Talking Pictures,'' a 1994 traveling exhibition that allowed museum visitors to listen to prerecorded commentaries about how the pictures had influenced the speakers' lives, and ''Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic Revolution,'' a 2000 exhibition at Exit Art in New York that focused on artists' responses to the promise and perils of genetic research. Together with ''Fame After Photography,'' commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, and ''To the Rescue: Artists in an Archive,'' a project based on the archive of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, these exhibitions were noted for their conceptual ingenuity and popular appeal.         Among the books produced by Ms. Kismaric and Mr. Heiferman under the Lookout name were ''Frida Kahlo: The Camera Seduced'' (Chronicle Books, 1992); ''Fay's Fairy Tales: Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood,'' by William Wegman (Hyperion, 1993); and ''Love is Blind'' (PowerHouse, 1997). In addition, as publications director of the P.S. 1 Museum since 1985, Ms. Kismaric developed books on the artists John Coplans, David Hammons and Jack Smith.         Carole Kismaric was born on April 28, 1942, in Orange, N.J. As a student at Penn State University she majored in psychology, but after graduation in 1964 she pursued a career as a newspaper reporter. Time-Life Books hired her as a picture researcher in 1970. As an associate editor, she helped develop the Time-Life Photography Series and edited five of its titles.         In 1974 Ms. Kismaric collaborated with John Szarkowski, then director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, on the exhibition ''From the Picture Press.'' The show consisted entirely of pictures pictures made for publication in newspapers and magazines.         When she joined Aperture in 1976, it was still associated with the aesthetic of its founding editor, the photographer Minor White. Working with Michael Hoffman, Aperture's publisher, she developed and edited more than 50 titles, including ''Diane Arbus: Magazine Work,'' ''The Eloquent Light'' by Ansel Adams, ''Telex Iran'' by Gilles Peress, and ''Social Graces'' by Larry Fink.         She also edited the quarterly magazine called Aperture, introducing to its pages a wide range of contemporary photographs far removed from the journal's traditional artistic roots.         After leaving Aperture in 1986, Ms. Kismaric struck out on her own and produced an exhibition and book, ''Forced Out: The Agony of the Refugee in Our Time'' (1989), under the auspices of the J. M. Kaplan Fund and Human Rights Watch. In 1990 she began teaching in the graduate photography program of the School of Visual Arts.         Ms. Kismaric was married to Charles Mikolaycak, a children' book illustrator. Mr. Mikolaycak died in 1993. She is survived by her sister, Susan.       
         Madeline Greenleaf Jaynes, a researcher, librarian and editor, died yesterday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 59.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Jaynes was a news researcher for The New York Times from 1971 to 1978 and later for CNN in Atlanta. For the last five years, she worked for Time magazine as assistant editor on the international edition. Earlier, she had lectured in English at Toyama University in Toyama City, Japan.         Ms. Jaynes was born in Orange, N.J., grew up in Short Hills and graduated from Millburn High School. She received a bachelor's degree in history from Earlham College in 1965 and a master's degree in library science two years later from the University of Michigan.         She is survived by her husband, Gregory Jaynes; a sister, Lisa Greenleaf Miller of New Haven; a brother, Newcomb Greenleaf of St. Johnsbury, Vt.; a stepson, Todd Jaynes of Dahlonega, Ga.; a stepdaughter, Whitney Jaynes Laidlaw; and two grandchildren.       
         Anne Fremantle, a British-born author, art critic, essayist and editor whose conversion to Roman Catholicism drew her to themes of faith and the saints, died on Thursday in London. She was 93 and had returned to Britain after nearly 50 years in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fremantle was known in this country and in Britain as a writer and teacher as well as a scholar and Catholic convert. Her faith was reflected in both her writings and in the many books that she edited.         Her own books included ''George Eliot'' (1933), ''The Medieval Philosophers'' (1955), ''The Protestant Mystics'' (1964) and ''The Age of Faith'' (1965). Among the books she edited were ''The Commonweal Reader'' (1949), ''Mothers: A Catholic Treasury of Great Stories'' (1951), ''The Papal Encyclicals in Their Historical Context'' (1956) and ''The Social Teachings of the Church'' (1963).         Born Anne-Marie Huth Jackson to titled English parents in Savoie, France, she graduated from Oxford University in 1930 and received a master's degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1932.         In World War II she became a volunteer ambulance driver and broadcast in French and German on the BBC. Married by then, Mrs. Fremantle settled in the United States in 1942, working in the British Embassy before she moved to New York and became a United States citizen in 1947. She worked in the communications department of Fordham University, was an editor at the United Nations, a writer-editor at Commonweal and a book reviewer for a number of publications, including The New York Times, Vogue, Town & Country and Harper's Bazaar.         She published her first poems in 1931 and followed them with nearly two dozen books, both fiction and nonfiction. She wrote ''Three-Cornered Heart'' (Viking, 1970), a chronicle of English family life.         Mrs. Fremantle is survived by three sons, Adam of Water Mill, N.Y.; Richard of Florence; and Hugh of Manhattan; three grandsons; and three great-grandchildren. Her husband, Christopher Fremantle, died in 1978.
