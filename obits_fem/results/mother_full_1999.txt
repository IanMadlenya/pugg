         Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with her luminous portrayal of the title role of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and -- with highs and lows professional and private -- went on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.         As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater, people who were, she said, ''supremely talented, alive, sensitive, eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''         When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an Off Broadway play and had acted in two films, ''The Cobweb'' and ''Picnic,'' that had not been released. And she had never studied acting with her father.         With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson characterized her as ''a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an actress.''         Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own and with her director, Garson Kanin. ''When we saw Susie in action  we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Mr. Strasberg said at the time. ''I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never had any formal training.''         Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement heralded her as ''a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ''Maya,'' and followed that with several roles on television, including ''Romeo and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.         She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ''Picnic.'' Mr. Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.         ''Susan was so terrified at the thought of being rejected that she declined to read at all,'' Mr. Bloomgarden had said in an interview. ''Finally, with tears in her eyes, Susan did read the last, touching scene from play. Within 10 minutes, she knew the part was hers.''         The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater marquee.         In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean Anouilh's ''Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ''Shadow of a Gunman'' and then she toured with Franchot Tone in ''Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963 she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ''Stage Struck.''         Within several years, her career had crested and her private life was in turmoil. In the early 1960's she  was using a wide variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was titled ''Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter, Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.         A reason she wrote her book, she  said, was that her career was stalled: ''It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years -- I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank -- there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.'' Her films include ''Kapo,'' ''The Trip,'' ''Manitou,'' ''Delta Force'' and ''Prime Suspect.'' In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being overly supervisory about her daughter's work.         She was also close to some of her father's students, especially Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ''Bittersweet'' and in her 1992 book, ''Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and New York, and by two half-brothers.         Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her in her Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Mr. Tone offered a toast: ''Little Susan, you have been launched on a long and glittering career.''       
         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Virginia Verrill, the on-screen singing voice of some of Hollywood's most famous leading ladies and later a popular radio star, died on Jan. 18 at the Mayview Nursing Home in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 and lived in Raleigh.         Ms. Verrill, born in Santa Monica, Calif., was a child of Hollywood, where her parents were musicians. At the age of 5 months she appeared in her mother's vaudeville act, and at 3 she made her first public singing appearance when Paul Whiteman, in whose band her father used to play, stood her on a piano while she sang ''I Never Knew I Could Love Anybody'' at the Palais Royale in Times Square. ''And from that minute, I guess,'' she later said, ''singing was what I wanted to do more than anything else.''         At 15, already a veteran of a West Coast band led by Orville Knapp, she was heard performing in a school play and asked to audition for an off-screen role singing ''Ten Cents a Dance'' in Barbara Stanwyck's film of the same name. She beat out more than 300 competitors.         She soon landed work as a professional dubber. Traveling from John Marshall High School in Los Angeles to Hollywood studios almost every day after school, she would sing for leading ladies whose voices were not considered quite up to par.         Disillusioned, Ms. Verrill left Hollywood in 1935 for the ''Socony Sketchbook'' on CBS radio and recorded with the Isham Jones Orchestra.         The tables seemed to turn in 1937, when she was seen on screen in ''Walter Wanger's Vogues of 1938,'' starring Warner Baxter and Joan Bennett. Ms. Verrill sang ''That Old Feeling,'' which became a hit.         The same year she was cast as the female lead in ''The Goldwyn Follies'' and taken under the wing of Samuel Goldwyn.         With newly dyed and styled hair, high heels and lifts in her shoes, Ms. Verrill was presented as ''the second Myrna Loy,'' and stardom seemed almost a certainty.         But the Goldwyn Company decided that the similarities between the two actresses were too strong. Ms. Verrill, who had already recorded the film's soundtrack, suddenly found herself ousted by the actress of the moment, Andrea Leeds, who had become an overnight success that year in ''Stage Door.''         Ms. Verrill abandoned Hollywood in the spring of 1938 for a career in radio and retired in 1942.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Louis Duddleston, and a son, James Breyley Jr., both of Raleigh; a daughter, Diana Caldwell of Anchorage, and seven grandchildren.       
         Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters, died peacefully in her sleep at age 109 yesterday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.         She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the first colored woman -- the term she preferred -- ever permitted to teach home economics in white New York City schools.         Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh, N.C.         Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was known to thousands of people only as ''Dr. Bessie.'' She charged $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her rates in 27 years of practice.         The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993 of a memoir they called ''Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white suburb.         The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and high schools, was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed it in 1995  with ''The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''         In 1995, ''Having Our Say'' was adapted by Emily Mann into a Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the home they owned on a dead-end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss Delany  remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. ''She is my right arm,'' Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly before her sister's death. ''If she were to die first, I'm not sure I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to keep her living.''         But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, ''On My Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in May 1997.         The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one, who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to her, ''Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the truth?''         If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses, with an uncommon talent for getting along  and for being as sweet as the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.         The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they suffered through segregation.         Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a ''colored woman'' or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as black -- that did not describe her color, she used to say -- nor did she care for the term African-American.         Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys, Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church. He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's. Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was  born Sept. 19, 1889, at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two sisters and six brothers on  the campus of St. Augustine's, where their father was vice principal.         Happy though they might have been, the South around them was not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around 1914. In ''Having Our Say,'' Sadie Delany wrote:         ''I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Mr. Heller's fault; this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, 'Good morning, Mr. Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.' And I would say, 'Where, Mr. Heller?' And he would gesture to the back and say, 'Back there.' And I would say, 'Back where?' Well, I'd just worry that man to death. Finally, he'd say, 'Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.         ''Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that,'' she recalled. ''But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section.''         Sadie Delany liked to say that  when she got her master's degree in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed, ''That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants anyway.''         In this, Miss Delany said, she was ''just like Papa.''         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for newborn infants.         Years later, she remembered her students: ''They looked up to me and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite what white people were trying to do to us.'' She proudly recalled driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.         The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in  1916, and Bessie came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the sisters were separated. Eventually, 9 of the 10 Delany children moved to New York, and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest, stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and nephews.         At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors complained.         ''They thought we were running a fast house!'' the two sisters recalled.  ''We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds. So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the whole mess.'' The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with people who did not understand them, and they always straightened out the mess.         While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny a piece.         People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a loft on 121st Street in the late 1920's and made homemade chocolate fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called ''Delany's Delights,'' it was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham & Straus, at $2 a pound. She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash. ''People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure,'' she said.         After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools, Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia, after all. No Negro had ever done that before. She applied for a job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to meet her.         She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter explaining there had been a ''mixup,'' and just showed up at the all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.         ''They just about died when they saw me,'' she recalled. ''A colored woman!''         She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where she taught adults at night.         It was lonely, she said. Some of her  fellow teachers, who were all white,  were friendly, she said, ''but you couldn't count on any of them being your real friend.''         She told Ms. Hearth: ''New York was no piece of cake for a colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child. But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa. Raleigh will always be home.''         ''Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said. ''She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss.'' ''         But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education once sent her what she called a ''nasty'' letter. She had lived for so long that the bean counters had become convinced that she must have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.         Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. ''Why, we don't even own a rocking chair,'' she said.         She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said, ''Thank you, Lord, for another day.'' Then she would wake up Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, ''Oh Lord, another day?''         Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga. They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.         They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they ''never had husbands to worry us to death.''         But Sadie Delany said, ''Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet.''       
         Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California artist and conservationist who fought for the survival of sea otters, sea lions, mountain lions and other wild creatures, died on Jan. 21 at Wild Bird, her clifftop home above the Pacific in Big Sur, Calif. She was 85.         The cause was heart failure, reported the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which recently published a paean by her to Mother Nature.         Mrs. Owings, a former member of the California Parks Commission, led campaigns to protect the world's forests and oceans. The National Audubon Society honored her with a medal in 1983 and last year listed her among 100 individuals who had done the most to shape the environmental movement, along with Barry Commoner, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, William O. Douglas, Lady Bird Johnson, Stewart Udall and Morris K. Udall.         A native of Berkeley, Calif., she graduated from Mills College in 1934 and completed graduate studies in art the next year at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. She had one-woman exhibitions of her stitchery at galleries and folk-art museums but largely set aside her art to work for conservation.         She and her second husband, Nathaniel Alexander Owings, a founding partner of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, fought to keep the developers away from the wild beauty of Big Sur.         Seasonal residents of Santa Fe, N.M., they also assembled a collection of the art and Pueblo culture of the Southwest, now part of the collection of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.         Mrs. Owings was the founder and first president of Friends of the Sea Otter and won a battle to end the bounty-hunting of mountain lions in her state. As a member of the Point Lobos League she was instrumental in saving the beaches between the Carmel River and Point Lobos State Preserve, near Monterey.         She sat on the council of the Save-the-Redwoods League and the Big Sur Land Trust. She was a past trustee of Defenders of Wildlife, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a founder of the Rachel Carson Council.         She wrote about her experiences and spent the last months of her life compiling her writings and artwork. The resulting book, ''Voice From the Sea: Reflections on Wildlife and Wilderness'' was published weeks before her death.         Nathaniel Owings, who designed their home, Wild Bird, died in 1984.         Mrs. Owings is survived by a daughter, Wendy M. Benjamin, of Durango, Colo., from her previous marriage to Malcolm Millard, a resident of Carmel, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Natalie O. Prael and Jennifer O. Dewey, both of Santa Fe., and Emily O. Kapozi, of Novato, Calif.; a brother, William Wentworth, of Walnut Creek, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Sunday about Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California conservationist, omitted the name of a surviving stepson. He is Nathaniel O. Owings of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Naomi Mitchison, author of more than 70 books, bohemian free thinker and feminist long before the term was coined, died on Monday at her home on the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland. She was 101.         The subjects and genres of her novels, biographies, poems, memoirs, short stories, political tracts, book reviews and magazine articles ranged over the successive enthusiasms of her life: ancient Greece, socialism, genetics, science fiction, space, fascism in Spain, home rule for Scotland and independence movements in Africa, where she became the honorary mother of a tribe in Botswana.         Her personal life drew as much attention as her work, from shocking contemporary convention in the 1920's by declaring her marriage an open one to her championing of birth control in the 1930's to her continual fights with publishers who insisted on removing explicit references to sex from her books.         A rebel against social restrictions on women from her youth, she had a tendency to lash out physically at men to prove her point, once throwing a half-plucked partridge at the Labor Party leader Hugh Gaitskill and on another occasion bopping a dinner guest over the head because he asked the woman seated next to him to fetch his dinner from the kitchen.         Married for 54 years and the mother of seven children, she was asked on her 90th birthday if she had any regrets. ''Yes,'' she said, ''all the men I never slept with. Imagine!''         Naomi Margaret Haldane was born in Edinburgh in 1897 and brought up in Oxford as a member of a privileged family that produced a number of patrician politicians and noted scientists.         Taught alternately at a private school in Oxford and at home by a governess, she had a precocious interest from earliest youth in being a more active participant in life than the conventions of an upper-class girl's upbringing in Britain allowed. She assisted a brother and the young Aldous Huxley as they performed experiments on guinea pigs on the lawn.         In 1916 she married Gilbert Richard (Dick) Mitchison, a lawyer who was a Labor member of Parliament from 1945 to 1964, when he joined the House of Lords. She never used the title she gained, Lady Mitchison, preferring to be known by her nickname, Nou.         She told friends that she was disappointed by her introduction to sex, complaining that it was ''so unlike Swinburne.'' In 1925 she and her husband both subscribed to the idea of an open marriage, in keeping with her statement that marriage amounted to ''domestic prostitution'' and ownership of women.         ''It must be fairly obvious to everyone who considers it that there is something profoundly wrong with the sexual life of people in general and particularly perhaps of married people,'' she said.         She wrote her first book in 1923, and her early writing met with critical success while causing scandal with its emphasis on subjects like rape, infanticide, lesbianism and abortion. In 1931 she became a literary force in Britain with the publication of ''The Corn King and the Spring Queen,'' a fantasy set in Scythia in 200 B.C. with a story based on an act of incest.         She wrote less effectively on socialism, an interest she developed from her husband's involvement in Fabian Society politics and her observation of the victims of the Depression. She remained an activist the rest of her life, running unsuccessfully for Parliament herself in 1935 and then serving on a number of boards and councils representing Highland and island communities in Scotland until her 90's, when she was, in her words, ''booted out on grounds of age.''         From the late 1930's she held forth at Carradale, her 300-acre farm on the Mull of Kintyre in Argyllshire, riveting diffuse collections of writers, Labor politicians, African visitors, academics, scientists, local fishermen and hunters, children and grandchildren. She was not distracted from writing by all the people in her drawing room, and she once said she felt most creative when pregnant. The title of a 1985 memoir was ''Among You Taking Notes.''         Her husband died in 1970; she is survived by three sons, two daughters, 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.         She was a commanding presence in her own salon, speaking with a mystical authority that her fellow author and friend, Elizabeth Longford, likened to ''what I imagine to be the kind of voice possessed by a Celtic prophetess reading the runes.''         At a British Council party in the early 1960's she befriended an African student who invited her to Botswana for his investiture as chief of the Bakgatla tribe. She was later named ''honorary mother'' of the tribe and traveled there often into her 90's.         Over the years she changed her hobby listing in Who's Who from ''keeping up with the family'' to ''surviving so far'' to ''burning rubbish.''         Her keen pursuit of new subjects continued into her last years. ''Dying is quite the most interesting thing that is going to happen to me now,''  she recently said. ''I often wake up in the night and wonder if it's starting. I would really like to take notes.''         Correction:  January 20, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Naomi Mitchison, the British writer and early feminist, misspelled the surname of the Labor Party leader at whom she once threw a half-plucked partridge. He was Hugh Gaitskell, not Gaitskill.       
         Lucille Kallen, the lone woman in the raucous, celebrated and astonishingly untidy group of television writers behind Sid Caesar's ''Your Show of Shows,'' died on Monday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Lise Engel.         ''Your Show of Shows,'' which starred Mr. Caesar and Imogene Coca, was broadcast live for 90 minutes on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is today revered as a classic of television's golden age. For writers, a job on the program was a coveted plum; many of Ms. Kallen's colleagues, including Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Neil Simon, would become show business luminaries in their own right.         The quick-witted, fast-talking gang of writers was so famous that it was memorialized repeatedly in popular culture, including the 1982 film ''My Favorite Year'' (remade as a Broadway musical in 1992) and Mr. Simon's play ''Laughter on the 23d Floor'' (1993). But Ms. Kallen, one of a tiny handful of women employed as television comedy writers in the 1950's, was curiously absent from these works: they featured instead a generic female character who was an amalgam of Ms. Kallen and Selma Diamond, a writer for ''Caesar's Hour,'' which succeeded ''Your Show of Shows.''         The two women were also conflated in the character of Sally Rogers, played by Rose Marie on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' That program, created by Mr. Reiner, starred Mr. Van Dyke as a television comedy writer.         ''Lucille got lost a little bit,'' said Mel Tolkin, the head writer on ''Your Show of Shows.''  ''She was generally the least given credit because the other people are so loud and so famous.''         But if her co-workers barreled into posterity as hit playwrights, movie directors and 2,000-year-old men, Ms. Kallen was, in Mr. Reiner's words, ''a real writer'' -- the profession's most dignified accolade -- who possessed a finely honed ear for dialogue.         ''She was quite a talented girl, and she was cute as a button, too,'' Mr. Reiner, who also performed as Mr. Caesar's second banana on ''Your Show of Shows,'' said recently. ''And being the woman, she did give it the woman's touch.''         In addition, Ms. Kallen was the author of six novels, including the C. B. Greenfield mystery series.         Last year, Ms. Kallen unearthed in her attic a faded piece of paper that neatly encapsulated her craft. The paper contained notes for a sketch in which a wife (Ms. Coca) bemoaned the spark gone from her marriage to Mr. Caesar:         Wife: Where is the sense of adventure? Where is the fun? Where is the romance?         Husband: How do I know where you put things? I can't even find my shirt!         ''This was so typical of their exchanges that I could practically write it in my sleep,'' Ms. Kallen observed in an oral history videotaped last April for the Archive of American Television in Hollywood.         Lucille Kallen was born on May 28, 1922, in Los Angeles. At 3, she moved with her mother to Toronto after her parents separated; she was raised there by her grandparents after her mother's death seven years later. As a girl, she trained to become a concert pianist; as a teen-ager, she founded a theater troupe, for which she wrote songs and sketches.         At 16, Ms. Kallen moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School, but in the years that followed she had two epiphanies that pre-empted her classical-music career: one, her fingers were too short; two, she hated to practice.         She turned instead to writing, putting together a nightclub revue that included the young Martin Balsam. The act was spotted by the producer Max Liebman, who invited Ms. Kallen to hone her craft at Camp Tamiment, a Poconos resort renowned for its Saturday night shows. At Tamiment, she was teamed with Mr. Tolkin, who would become her longtime writing partner. She also met her future husband, Herbert Engel, who worked there as a soda jerk; they were married in 1952. Mr. Engel, a businessman, survives her, as do her daughter, of Manhattan; her son, Paul, of Oceanside, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         On the strength of their Tamiment sketches, Ms. Kallen and Mr. Tolkin were hired to write for a new television show produced by Mr. Liebman, ''The Admiral Broadway Review,'' which paired Mr. Caesar and Ms. Coca for the first time. Undeterred by the fact that she had never even seen a television program, Ms. Kallen signed on, dashing off sketches with Mr. Tolkin in a corner of the male dancers' dressing room. The program, broadcast simultaneously on NBC and the Dumont network from January to June of 1949, was the direct progenitor of ''Your Show of Shows,'' which made its debut on NBC the following year.         As Ms. Kallen recalled, she and her colleagues didn't simply write ''Your Show of Shows,'' they lived it, working seven days a week, 39 weeks a year at the program's offices in midtown Manhattan, producing a series of now-classic sketches, including movie parodies (''From Here to Obscurity''), opera sendups (''Galipacci'') and the weekly travails of the married couple Charles and Doris Hickenlooper for the live broadcast on Saturday night.         In their cramped domain, known as the Writers' Room, the air was blue with cigar smoke and invective and the decor was early fraternity house: dogeared sofa, discarded paper cups crunching underfoot, half-eaten sandwiches abandoned beneath piles of typescript, acoustical-tile ceiling stuck with pencils hurled there in moments of frustration, and widening pools of spilled coffee. ''I learned,'' Ms. Kallen wrote afterward, ''to wear dark skirts.''         As the men paced and the room erupted with jokes and argument, Ms. Kallen was a small, ordered island in a roiling sea, sitting calmly, her legs tucked under her, taking down the good stuff in pencil on a yellow legal pad as it hurtled by, all the while contributing her share. ''She was the only one who could write and talk at the same time,'' Mr. Caesar recalled recently. ''The rest of us were all crazy. It was all being made up at that moment: 'Put it in!'  'Take it out!'  'You've got to put it back!' So it was a very, very frustrating job.''         Most of the writers were extremely large. All of them were extremely loud. Ms. Kallen was 5 foot 1 and, when off duty, spoke with measured thoughtfulness.         ''I was torn between preserving my femininity and preserving my career,'' she later said. ''It was difficult to be forceful enough to get through.''         At one point, she resorted to standing on the sofa and waving a red scarf to command attention. It worked -- briefly.         When ''Your Show of Shows'' went off the air, Ms. Kallen turned down a job with its successor, ''Caesar's Hour'' (1954-57), to write for ''The Imogene Coca Show,'' which lasted only a single season. With Mr. Tolkin, she wrote a short-lived Broadway play, ''Maybe Tuesday'' (1958). In addition to writing five mysteries, she was the author of the novel ''Outside There, Somewhere,'' (1964), a comic, early feminist exploration of the competing demands of career and motherhood.         Reflecting on her Writers' Room days, Ms. Kallen was forthright about the condescension as well as the camaraderie she encountered there. ''At the time I felt it was one big happy family, but later I said, What an idiot!'' she remarked. ''There was a male phalanx, and then there was me. But when we were working, there was no difference.''       
         Jeanne-Marie Darre, a French pianist whose interpretations of Chopin and Liszt solo works and the Saint-Saens Concertos were admired for their sophistication and interpretive inventiveness, died on Jan. 26 in Port Marly, France, where she lived. She was 93.         Miss Darre was an elegant player who dazzled with the strength and clarity of her technique but was also a provocative interpreter. Her account of the Liszt Sonata in B minor, for example, was unusually slow but also uncommonly rich in lyricism and detail. Miss Darre also had considerable stamina. When she was 21 she played all five of the Saint-Saens Piano Concertos in a single program with the Concerts Lamoureux orchestra, conducted by Paul Paray. She repeated that feat twice and sometimes played all the Chopin Etudes and Preludes in a single recital program.         Miss Darre was born in 1905 in Givet, France, a town near the Belgian border, and studied the piano with her mother until she was 10. She was then taken to the Paris Conservatory. Her principal teachers were Isidore Philipp and Marguerite Long, through whom she met and worked with several great French composers of the time, among them Faure, Saint-Saens and Ravel.         She made her debut at 14 and at first pursued her career mostly in Europe. By the time she performed in the United States for the first time, in February 1962, she was a revered teacher at the Paris Conservatory, had been awarded the Legion of Honor and had been made a Chevalier des Arts et Lettres. She had also made several recordings that were treasured by collectors of piano works, so her debut at Carnegie Hall with Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony Orchestra was an eagerly anticipated event.         Miss Darre played the Saint-Saens Concerto No. 2 on that occasion. Harold C. Schoenberg, reviewing the performance for The New York Times, described her as ''an exciting, formidable, electrical virtuoso, who can do anything at the keyboard and do it with aplomb.''         ''But it is not all technique,'' he wrote. ''She has complete tonal control, and a massive sonority.''         Miss Darre returned to give her first American recitals at the end of 1962, and returned regularly through the early 1980's, when she retired from the concert stage.         Several of Miss Darre's recordings have appeared on compact disk in recent years. Among them are her mid-1960's traversals of the Chopin Preludes, Waltzes and Scherzos, on Vanguard Records, and a collection of recordings she made in Paris between 1922 and 1947, on VAI Audio.         Miss Darre left no immediate family.       
         Gertrude B. Elion, a pioneer in drug research who shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988, died on Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where she lived. She was 81.         Ms. Elion developed drugs for use in a vast array of conditions. They included drugs for herpes, leukemia, malaria, gout, immune disorders, and AIDS, and immune suppressants to overcome rejection of donated organs in transplant surgery. In perfecting one compound after another, Ms. Elion worked for four decades with Dr. George H. Hitchings, who died a year ago.         Ms. Elion broke down sex barriers in the male-dominated world of scientific research, becoming one of the rare women to win a Nobel Prize and, even rarer, a scientist who did not have a doctorate.         Ms. Elion shared the Prize with Dr. Hitchings, who hired her as a $50-a-week assistant in 1944. Also sharing the Prize was Sir James Black of Britain, who discovered two classes of drugs, beta blockers, for high blood pressure and heart disease, and H-2 antagonists, for ulcers.         Seldom does the Nobel committee in Stockholm honor employees of pharmaceutical companies, but all three that year worked or had worked for such a company. Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings collaborated throughout their careers at the company known today as Glaxo Wellcome. In awarding the Prize to the three scientists, the Nobel committee said their work ''had a more fundamental significance than their discovery of individual drugs.''         Ms. Elion was noted for her precise work, intellectual brilliance and ability to work with others.         Few scientists matched the wide array of drugs that Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings developed. The drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax) for herpes; azathioprine (Imuran) to help prevent rejection of transplanted organs and in treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis; allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout; pyrimethamine (Daraprim) for malaria and trimethoprim (a component of Septra) for bacterial infections.         The two worked in lock step for much of their careers, but Dr. Hitchings was always one step ahead of Ms. Elion; as he moved into a new job, she filled the old one.         The two scientists wrote many papers together, sometimes with her name first, sometimes his. As Ms. Elion said, ''He had two arms of research and I was one of them.''         In 1991, President George Bush awarded Ms. Elion a National Medal of Science, saying her work had ''transformed the world.''         Gertrude Belle Elion was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1918, and graduated with highest honors in chemistry from Hunter College in 1937. Ms. Elion decided to go into medical research as a teen-ager after her grandfather died of cancer and her father, a dentist and Lithuanian immigrant, encouraged her to develop a career. Her mother was from Russia.         But unable to find a laboratory position because she was a woman, Ms. Elion took a succession of jobs. First, she worked as a laboratory assistant in biochemistry. Then she worked as a food analyst, checking the acidity of pickles and making sure the berries slated for jam were not moldy. Next, she taught chemistry and physics in the New York City school system before earning a master's degree in chemistry at New York University in 1941.         After working for Johnson & Johnson for two years, Ms. Elion, helped by labor shortages in World War II, joined what was then Wellcome Research Laboratories, in Tuckahoe, N.Y., as a biochemist. Ms. Elion later became head of the company's experimental therapy department.         She retired in 1983, but continued working, helping to oversee work on the development of AZT as the first drug against H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Ms. Elion also served on the faculty of Duke University and the University of North Carolina.         While working for the drug company, Ms. Elion felt that her lack of a doctorate was a disadvantage, so she began a Ph.D. program at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. She took courses at night, commuting an hour and a half each way. But she eventually had to quit because she was told she would have to attend school full time to get a Ph.D., and she could not afford to give up her job.         When she gave her first scientific paper at a major meeting, she said she got into an argument with a distinguished scientist and stood her ground because ''I knew I was right.''         Ms. Elion never married. She was once engaged, but her fiance died of a heart infection. Ms. Elion said she would not have advanced in her career if she had chosen to marry and have children because women were not encouraged then to work while their children were young.       
         Bessie Cohen, who as a 19-year-old seamstress escaped the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 107 and was one of the last two known survivors of the Manhattan fire, according to the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.         Her son, Jack Kosslyn, an acting teacher and casting director, said she died at the Jewish Home for the Aging in Los Angeles, where she had lived for the last 14 years. Until six weeks ago, he said, she had retained much of her vitality and memory.         Over the years, she had graphically recalled for her family, as well as for historians and documentary filmmakers, what she experienced and witnessed on March 25, 1911, when the worst factory fire in New York history raged through the top three floors of the 10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Streets. Inside, about 500 women, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrants, worked behind locked doors making shirtwaists. Shirtwaists were blouses of lightweight fabric, depicted as the uniform of modern womanhood in the illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson.         It was a Saturday afternoon, and Mrs. Cohen, then still Bessie Gabrilowich, was on the ninth floor. She had come alone from Russia to New York two years earlier and had worked in several shops as a stitcher, saving money to bring her sisters to America. The workers were near the end of their 6-day, 52-hour workweek, and since one of the women on the ninth floor had just become engaged, someone had brought a cake, and slices were being passed around.         For the rest of her life, Bessie Cohen would remember that earlier in the day, she had urged her friend, Dora Abramowitz, who was 15, to ask the foreman to give her a 50-cent raise to bring her salary up to the $3 a week that Bessie was earning. At the moment that someone screamed fire, Bessie was teaching a dance step to a fellow worker. The flames were coming up from the cutting room on the floor below.         Within the next 15 minutes, nearly 30 percent of all the Triangle Shirtwaist workers were killed. Mrs. Cohen would later tell her children that after the warning, she went to look for the cheap straw hat she had bought the day before, when she heard a foreman shout to her in Yiddish, ''Bessie, save yourself.'' She looked across the room and could see her friend Dora, looking frightened. But when she looked again, Dora was gone. She was one of those who jumped from the windows and died.         The fire trucks' ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. Firefighters held nets below, but so many women were jumping at the same time that the nets tore and did not hold them. Some rushed to the elevator shaft, hoping to escape by sliding down the cables, only to lose their grip. Most of those who lost their lives had worked on the ninth floor.         Later inquiries found that doors leading from the shop areas had been locked, presumably to keep the women at their sewing machines. The owners, who were tried for manslaughter, were acquitted when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were locked. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Cohen would recall, she somehow found her way to a staircase and covered her face with her purse as she ran to the street.         The next day, she returned to the street outside the building, where the bodies were arrayed so that friends and relatives might identify them. A newspaper photographer took a picture of her as she collapsed at the sight; Mr. Kosslyn said his mother kept that newspaper picture throughout her life.         She took other jobs, he said, and became active in the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, whose organizing efforts gained momentum after the fire. Two years before the blaze, a three-month strike of about 20,000 shirtwaist workers in New York City and Philadelphia had helped to entrench the union and had focused public attention on conditions in sweatshops. The needletrades union is a successor to the International Ladies Garment Workers.         At least one survivor of the fire is still living, according to The Associated Press. Rose Freedman, 105, of Beverly Hills, Calif., escaped by fleeing to the roof, her family said.         The Triangle Shirtwaist fire has become the most vivid symbol of the struggle for workplace safety. As outrage mounted after the fire, the union intensified its demands for safer working conditions. A huge crowd of sympathizers, Mrs. Cohen among them, paraded in mourning to the arch in Washington Square Park. Hearings were held, and by the end of 1911, the city of New York had established a Bureau of Fire Investigation, headed by the future Senator, Robert F. Wagner, who was later the father of the Wagner Labor Act. The bureau had the power to impose and enforce safety regulations.         The Asch Building, its interior long since gutted and rebuilt, became a part of New York University and still stands.         In 1915, Bessie married and moved with her husband, Lewis Cohen, to New London, Conn., where her son and daughter were born. For many years after the fire, her son said, she would react fearfully to thunder and lightning, burying her head in her arms and sobbing.         The family moved to Passaic, N.J., and then to New York. In 1940, after her marriage ended, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son was living. Mrs. Cohen, an independent woman, lived on her own until she was 93 in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, staying on after most of the Jewish residents had left.         When she was 89, she was mugged and had her jaw fractured by two men who took her purse, which contained a bus pass and 60 cents.         After two weeks, she returned to her home and neighbors, sipping liquids through her wired jaw for months. When she finally did leave for the nursing home, about 200 of her neighbors, almost all of them Hispanic, saluted her with a festive street party.         She is survived by her son, Jack, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Sylvia Scott of Calistoga, Calif. A grandson, Jan Tangen, died last year.       
         Shirley Stoler, an actress best known for her role as the Nazi commandant in Lina Wertmuller's 1976 film ''Seven Beauties,'' died on Feb. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her brother Ira.         Ms. Stoler, a native of Brooklyn whose acting career spanned four decades, considered herself the first significantly fat actress to do dramatic roles rather than comedy. Her weight, which hovered around 250 pounds in her early years, limited her choices, she said in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. ''Weight shouldn't be a hindrance, but casting people are afraid of it,'' she said. ''I could play 'Medea,' but they wouldn't cast me for it.''         Her imposing figure frequently landed Ms. Stoler the part of the villain or shrew, most notably in ''Seven Beauties,'' in which she played the sadistic commandant of a Nazi concentration camp to critical acclaim. Six years earlier, in Leonard Kastle's ''Honeymoon Killers,''  she played a predatory nurse executed for murder. Her film credits  also include ''The Deer Hunter'' and ''Klute.''         Ms. Stoler appeared on Broadway as Lolita's mother in Edward Albee's 1981 stage adaptation of the Nabokov novel. She played villainous roles on many television series.         In addition to her brother Ira, of Fairfield, Conn., she is survived by another brother, David, of Wanaque, N.J., and a sister, Miriam, of Delray Beach, Fla.       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         Iris Murdoch, a prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic British writer whose 26 novels offered lively plots, complex characters and intellectual speculation, died yesterday at a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 79 and had Alzheimer's disease.         Her struggle with Alzheimer's was documented recently in ''Elegy for Iris,'' a memoir by her husband, the critic and novelist John Bayley, who was at her bedside when she died.         Miss Murdoch's first novel was published in 1954 and in a career that lasted for more than four decades, her fiction received many honors, including the Booker Prize for ''The Sea, the Sea,'' the Whitbread Literary Award for Fiction for ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for ''The Black Prince.'' Although she was made a Dame of the British Empire, she rarely garnered the attention given to gaudier contemporaries. She spent much of her career quietly teaching and writing, away from lecture tours, prize committees and television appearances.         Along with novels, she produced a half a dozen works on philosophy, several plays, critical writing on literature and modern ideas and poetry.         Miss Murdoch had a background in philosophy -- she knew and wrote about Jean-Paul Sartre, studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and was a lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University -- and her fiction grappled with such questions as the nature of good and evil. This led many who knew her work superficially to assume that her novels were philosophical explorations of the origins of morality and behavior and too esoteric or intellectually rigorous for a general audience.         In fact, many of Miss Murdoch's novels are exuberantly melodramatic, offering bemused records of romantic or erotic follies, as well as more somber battles between individuals representing moral good and its opposite. Her characters, drawn largely from the middle class, are described with loving exactitude and in such depth that their struggles to define what it means to live a good life take on dramatic force.         In Books, Happiness And Moral Lessons         Far from viewing fiction as another and lesser way of dealing with philosophical questions, Miss Murdoch argued that literature was meant ''to be grasped by enjoyment,'' and that the art of the tale was ''a fundamental form of thought'' in its own right. The ideal reader, she told one interviewer, was ''someone who likes a jolly good yarn and enjoys thinking about the book as well, about the moral issues.'' In another interview she went further, asserting that good art offers ''uncontaminated'' happiness that also teaches ''how to look at the world and to understand it; it makes everything far more interesting.''         Her belief in literature had its inception in her happy and book-filled childhood. Jean Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin on July 15, 1919, the only child of British and Irish parents. When she was a year old her family moved to London, where her father, Wills John Hughes Murdoch, joined the civil service. In interviews she remembered that as a child she had existed ''in a perfect trinity of love.'' Her mother, the former Irene Alice Richardson, who had trained as an opera singer, was a ''beautiful, lively, witty woman with a happy temperament.''         Her father began discussing books with her early on and encouraged her to read widely. She progressed rapidly from Lewis Carroll (one of her favorites) and Robert Louis Stevenson to more adult fare. Her great pleasure in reading, and her early attempts to write stories led to the conviction, which she formed as a child, that she would become a writer.         She attended boarding school in Bristol, and in 1938 entered Somerville College, a women's college at Oxford, where she studied the classics, ancient history and philosophy. She graduated with honors in 1942 and immediately took a job with the Treasury. In 1944 she began working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which helped Europeans displaced by World War II. The somber experiences of the war had a profound impact on her thinking. Close friends died while in service, and her work, often on the front lines, with poor and elderly refugees was hard but instructive.         If her childhood had been mostly idyllic, there was, she later noted, at  least one shadow falling across her memories of those years: her family members were largely ''wanderers,'' cut off from their Irish relations and their roots. Working with refugees led her to reflect further on the place of the exile in modern society, as well as on the sources of evil, raising questions that she would pursue in many novels.         After leaving the United Nations, Miss Murdoch took up further study in philosophy at Cambridge University, where she worked with Wittgenstein. While she expressed no lasting allegiance to his school of thought, she said her studies with him  spurred her development as a writer.         In 1948 she became a fellow and tutor at St. Anne's College at Oxford, where she remained for 15 years as a lecturer in philosophy. It was a particularly heady time for anyone concerned with the study and application of philosophical thought; new schools of philosophy were contending for primacy and often combative works were being produced to define these emerging disciplines.         Miss Murdoch had met Sartre, the most visible proponent of existentialism, while working with refugees in  Belgium. Existentialism, with its focus on individual will, appealed to her, but she found its emphasis on the primacy of the self disturbing.  Her first published work, ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' (1953), was a serious, clear explanation of existentialism and its place in contemporary thought. While it was balanced, it was not uncritical: Miss Murdoch felt that existentialism encouraged an almost hermetic focus on the self, ignoring the corrosive implications of such a perspective on society.         Her study paid special attention to Sartre's fiction. She had already written and discarded several novels, but now she had become absorbed with how fiction expressed ideas and the ways fiction and ideas could best be blended. ''Under the Net,'' her first published novel, appeared to generally positive reviews. It focused on the picaresque adventures of a free-spirited Irishman making the rounds of some of the more raffish areas of London and Paris. A reviewer in The Times Literary Supplement said the work seemed to announce the emergence of ''a brilliant talent.''         The novel signaled the beginning of an industrious and prolific career.  Miss Murdoch published, on average, a novel every two years for the next four decades. Her work, while varied in setting and tone, rarely moved far from several central preoccupations and themes.         She first encountered existentialist writings while working with refugees, and she drew deeply from her fascination with those experiences in  her second novel, ''Flight From the Enchanter'' (1956). It concerns the  well-intentioned, conventionally liberal Rose Keep, who attempts to offer solace to two Polish brothers, refugees from the war. Her efforts founder because she cannot see the brothers as something more than symbols of displaced, wounded humanity.         Revisiting Themes Of Pure Love         The double-edged nature of love figures often in Miss Murdoch's fiction. True love, she asserted in the essay ''The Sublime and the Good,'' was perhaps the best way to overcome isolation and the absorption with one's crippled and constricted self. ''Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real,'' she argued.         Many of the figures in her fourth novel, ''The Bell'' (1958), are crippled by their inability to clearly see, and thus to truly love, those around them. ''The Bell'' reached a new level of sophistication for Miss Murdoch, displaying elements that would  become hallmarks of her fiction: effortless shifting between the grim and the humorous; deft marshaling of a large, varied cast of characters and numerous subplots, and creation of fables or myths that could suggest the struggle between true and diminished forms of love.         In many of Miss Murdoch's novels, romantic disasters, suicides and even murder are set in motion by a character who is brilliant and ferociously self-absorbed. Such figures, usually men, often go beyond egotism into evil.         In ''A Fairly Honorable Defeat'' (1970), a biologist who helps create biological weapons sets out to destroy those around him. But goodness, Miss Murdoch suggests, while imperiled, is also resilient.         In ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' (1974), the only character who comes close to true altruism is destroyed. But the novel suggests that her death may have opened the  hearts of those around her to a better, more responsible life.         ''The Sea, the Sea'' (1978), which received the Booker Prize, is considered one of Miss Murdoch's best novels. Its protagonist, a retired theatrical director trying to win back his first love, is not so much evil as simply self-absorbed and dangerously certain of his limited view of the world.         ''A Severed Head'' (1961) was a black farce about infidelity, incest and violence.         Storytelling And Large Truths         Miss Murdoch was always balancing the demands of storytelling with the more urgent need to examine how the truth of a fleeting life reflected the larger, permanent truths of  existence.         ''The Red and the Green'' charts the fates of two friends who find themselves on opposite sides during Ireland's 1916 Easter rebellion against British rule.         ''The Nice and the Good'' follows  the efforts of a decent man to uncover the reasons for a colleague's suicide and extricate himself from the seamy web of blackmail and the occult that he uncovers.         ''Italian Girl'' traces the struggle of a young man to liberate himself from the corrosive effects of family secrets and a shallow, destructive image of love.         The tension generated by this iconoclastic approach to fiction has made Murdoch's novels unique and controversial. Her fiction takes a distinctive vigor and texture from its combination of the usual elements of a tale with a sustained, sophisticated inquiry into such concepts as the defining characteristics of goodness, the nature of morality, the place of faith in everyday life and the conflict between spiritual and carnal love.         When most other writers were content to dwell on the heated specifics of individual lives or to simply offer a catalogue of society's ills, Miss Murdoch dared to suggest that fiction should be a means of dealing with life's largest and most basic issues and a way to learn about moral behavior.         This quest ''for a passion beyond any center of self,'' as David Bromwich wrote in The New York Times Book Review, made her fiction unlike that of any other contemporary Western writer. It also let her in for  both considerable acclaim and criticism. Harold Bloom, while praising her ''formidable combination of intellectual drive and storytelling exuberance'' in a review of her novel ''The Good Apprentice'' in The Times, and noting her ''mastery'' in ''representing the maelstrom of falling in love,'' also found that her narrative voice often lacked authority, ''being too qualified and fussy.''         Anthony Burgess, while noting the highly original ''synthesis of the traditional and revolutionary'' in her work and praising her talent for creating stories that were ''both thoroughly realistic yet at the same time loaded with symbols,'' also argued in his 1967 book ''The Novel Now'' that her characters were too often ''caught up in a purely intellectual  pattern.'' In a memorable phrase, he contended that, while Miss Murdoch had a rare ability ''to dredge that world of the strange and mysterious'' that rested ''on the boundary of the ordinary,'' her work rarely offered a convincing portrait of the more common realms of life.         In a body of work so large, both admirers and critics were bound to find material to advance their arguments, and this was true as well in her later novels, such as ''The Message to the Planet'' (1989) and ''The Green Knight'' (1994).         But neither criticism nor praise seemed much to affect her. She said that she never read her reviews. She rarely read modern writers, preferring the British and European novelists of the 19th century (Jane Austen,  Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Henry James, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky), with whom she felt an affinity, describing them as ''moralistic writers who portray the complexity of morality and the difficulty of being good.''         She lived for many years in the small village of Steeple Aston, near  Oxford, in a house crowded with books and paintings. The quiet life there, and in the house in Oxford to which she moved in 1986, has been described memorably by her husband, an Oxford don, in ''Elegy for Iris,'' his memoir of their lives together.         John Bayley fell in love with Iris Murdoch when he was in his late 20's and she was in her early 30's; she passed his window on a bicycle. ''I indulged the momentary fantasy that nothing had ever happened to her; that she was simply bicycling about, waiting for me to arrive,'' he wrote. ''She was not a woman with a past or an unknown present.'' They were married in 1956; he is her only close survivor.         The novelist Mary Gordon, reviewing ''Elegy for Iris'' in The Times, touched on their relationship. ''Radical privacy, sealing compartments of her life off from each other, was always a condition of Iris Murdoch's selfhood, and anyone who married her had to deal with that. From the beginning, she had friendships that she kept from Bayley, and love affairs that he was meant to understand had nothing to do with him. There are some hints that this was not always easy, but Bayley rose to the challenge.'' Ms. Gordon then quotes Mr. Bayley's memoir: ''In early days, I always thought it would be vulgar -- as well as not my place -- to give any indications of jealousy, but she knew when it was there, and she soothed it just by being the self she always was with me, which I soon knew to be wholly and entirely different from any way that she was with other people.''         Slipping Into A Baffling Darkness         In 1995 Miss Murdoch told an interviewer that she was experiencing severe writer's block, noting that the struggle to write had left her in ''a  hard, dark place.'' In 1996, Mr. Bayley announced that she had Alzheimer's disease, which she had suffered for five years by the time she died. Her final three weeks were spent in a nursing home. If ''Elegy for Iris'' offers a moving evocation of a great love story, it also provides a grim record of watching the personality of a loved one gradually dwindle under the burden of fear, bafflement and grief.         She was, Miss Murdoch confided to one of her friends, ''sailing into the darkness.'' Mr. Bayley's descriptions of his struggle to understand his wife's suffering, to find ways to ameliorate it and to come to grips with the physical demands of his new responsibilities and to understand the conflicting emotions aroused in him by the experience are exact, penetrating and unsparing. Miss Murdoch became like ''a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband said, and she needed to be fed, bathed and changed.         The note on which the book concludes, however, is one of reconciliation, and of a painfully won serenity. ''Every day,'' Mr. Bayley wrote of their lives together in Miss Murdoch's last years, ''we are physically closer. . . . She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''       
         Vivian Hallinan, the striking matriarch of one of San Francisco's best-known and most colorful political families, died on Tuesday at a granddaughter's home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 88.         Mrs. Hallinan, the widow of Vincent Hallinan, a fiery socialist lawyer who died in 1995, made a multi-million-dollar fortune by buying apartment buildings during the Great Depression.         ''She didn't trust the stock market, so she didn't get wiped out, and had money to buy buildings real cheap,'' said Shane Hallinan, the granddaughter at whose home Mrs. Hallinan died.         Her profits financed her political causes, which included leftist movements like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. ''She was aware of the contradiction,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''But she believed she was able to do something to better the world with the money she made.''         A native San Franciscan, Mrs. Hallinan was born Oct. 21, 1910, to Ed Moore and Katherine Lagomarsino Moore. After her parents' brief marriage ended, she was reared by her mother, whose maiden name she adopted, and by a series of immigrant Italian relatives. She attended the University of California at Berkeley.         After her marriage in 1932 to Mr. Hallinan Mrs. Hallinan reared six sons. She wrote about the experience in ''My Wild Irish Rogues'' (Doubleday & Company, 1952).         Politics was her passion as much as parenting, however. She helped her husband with his campaign in 1952 as the Presidential candidate of the Progressive Party. She also held the family together when he spent six months in jail in the 1950's for contempt of court, in connection with his support of the labor organizer Harry Bridges, who was accused of being a Communist Party member.         Mrs. Hallinan, elegant and chestnut-haired, served 30 days for participating in the 1964 civil rights demonstrations in San Francisco. She was also tear-gassed once, in Chile in the early 1980's.         ''She found the experience in jail heartening,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''She was used to being judged by her movie-star looks or her money, and here she was with just all these other women. The other stuff didn't matter, and she liked that.''         With her during that civil rights demonstration were all of her sons, including Terence Hallinan, now the district attorney for San Francisco.  ''Everyone was there except my father, who stayed outside with the bail money,'' said Patrick Hallinan of Kentfield, Calif.         Besides Terence and Patrick, Mrs. Hallinan is survived by three other sons: Matthew, Daniel and Conn, all of Berkeley, and 16 grandchildren.       
         Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in Gualala, Calif. She was 90.         She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed depiction of Lenin.         At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.         If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ''Man at the Crossroads,'' in the great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center capstone now known as the G.E. Building and at the time an especially potent symbol of capitalism.         Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.         Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.         Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not reckoned on  Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.         A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925, when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted by mistresses, took her children to Paris.         There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.         By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art. Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch, who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to the great man.         During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up behind Miss Bloch and said, ''I hate you,'' a comment of such disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it happened, from Miss Bloch.         As the the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear, she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.         Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as the basis for a book.         The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the country, including her most acclaimed work, ''The Evolution of Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.         They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif., where Mr. Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the couple retired to Gualala in 1965.         After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.         For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo; a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only herself to blame.         It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Mr. Dimitroff and Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.         The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation, the mural was shrouded from public view.         Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it was scraped into oblivion -- almost.         Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was -- on a Rockefeller wall.         Correction:  April 6, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary of the muralist Lucienne Bloch on March 28 misspelled the given name of her father. He was Ernest Bloch, not Ernst.       
         Her hair is boyishly cropped, her clothes are casual, and while riding her bike around Cape Cod she could pass as a college freshman.         But Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau is no freshman. A teacher at Harvard University and an accomplished experimenter, she has gained a formidable reputation in a branch of science traditionally dominated by men: physics.         Most of all, she is known as the scientist who slowed light down to a walk.         Dr. Lene (pronounced LEE-nuh) Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching the top of her profession, her colleagues agree. On Feb. 18 the prestigious scientific journal Nature selected for its cover article a paper of which she was the leading author, and it caused a mild sensation.         In their paper, Dr. Hau, with Dr. Steve E. Harris of Stanford University and two of Dr. Hau's Harvard students, reported the results of their experiment in which a beam of laser light was slowed to the astonishingly low speed of 38 miles an hour. (By comparison, light in a vacuum travels about 186,000 miles per second.)         Dr. Hau's laboratory at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge (where she conducts research with the help of her graduate and post-doctoral students from Harvard) ) is one of a handful of organizations studying the interactions of lasers with a very peculiar kind of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.         It was by shining precisely tuned lasers on such a condensate, or cloud, of ultra-cold sodium atoms that Dr. Hau and her team reduced the speed of a light beam to a pace slower than her bicycle.         The achievement, noted by many newspapers, magazines and broadcasters, was a tour de force of pure physics, and it may also herald great practical applications.         Among them could be the development of optical switches that could enormously improve the performance of computers.         Dr. Hau presides over a half million dollars' worth of apparatus at the Rowland Institute, a research organization founded by the late Edwin H. Land, the inventor of Polaroid instant photography, to support innovative research. Unmarried, Dr. Hau lives near the laboratory and spends most of her time either at the laboratory or pondering the problems her next experiment will present.         ''I find that the shower is a very good place to think things out,'' she said, ''but sometimes I forget what I'm doing. Once I even stepped into the shower with my clothes on.''         Although increasing numbers of women have entered the sciences in recent years, their participation in physics remains very limited. Of several hundred scientists attending a typical physics meeting, only a half dozen or so are likely to be women. Dr. Hau is often asked how she came to be one of them.         ''For one thing,'' she said, ''I was lucky to be a Dane. Denmark has a long scientific tradition that included the great Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum theory.         In Denmark, physics is widely respected by laymen as well as scientists, and laymen contribute to physics. For instance, research in quantum mechanics has been supported in Denmark by the makers of Carlsberg beer since the 1920's. I myself was supported as a graduate student for one year by a Carlsberg scholarship.''         Dr. Hau was born in Vejle, a small town not far from the University of Aarhus, on the east coast of Jutland.         ''Neither of my parents had any background in science,'' she said. ''My father was in the heating business and my mother worked in a store. But both of them believed in giving me the same advantages as my brother, which was very important to my education.''         A prodigy who skipped 10th grade, she was immediately accepted at a ''gymnasium,'' a European upper school roughly equivalent to the first two years of college in the United States.         From childhood Dr. Hau was fascinated by mathematics, especially geometry. ''All my life I have needed to visualize things, even abstractions. Without a visualization in my head I'm lost, and geometry is very visual.''         This approach to physics works, she said, even for visualizing mathematical abstractions like Hilbert spaces (named for David Hilbert, a German mathematician), which combine a variety of physical states (or ''wave functions'') into a single mathematical entity.         ''When I first entered Arhus University,'' Dr. Hau recalled, ''I was bored by physics. They just taught us thermodynamics and classical mechanics, and that bored me. But I loved mathematics. I would rather do mathematics than go to the movies in those days.         ''But after a while I discovered quantum mechanics, and that got me interested in physics again, and I've been hooked ever since.''         Quantum mechanics is a system of probabalistic rules governing the discontinuous jumps in behavior of very small particles of matter and energy. Transistors and many other electronic devices work according to these rules.         Dr. Hau was awarded her Ph.D. from the University of Arhus in 1991 after completing a dissertation on the ''channeling'' of electrons along strings of atoms in a silicon crystal, as if the atomic strings were miniature wave guides, like the optical fibers used to guide light.         Along the way she acquired a working knowledge of English, German and French. French proved to be vital to her work during seven months of research she conducted at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva.         ''The scientific papers were written in English, but the meetings announcing the availability of various particle beams were all in French, and without French I would have been lost,'' Dr. Hau said.         ''I loved it at CERN. The people were really passionate about their work. Even at 3 in the morning you would always see people in the labs.''         In 1988, while completing her Ph.D. work, Dr. Hau made her first trip to the United States, looking for a post-doctoral job. By then she had received a one-year stipend from Carlsberg so she could accept a post-doctoral university appointment without pay. Among the scientists she met was Dr. Jene A. Golovchenko, a physicist at Harvard, who also worked at the Rowland Institute.         ''I told Jene what I had been doing and also that I wanted a complete change in direction. I wanted to work on cooling atoms,'' she said. ''He told me he didn't know anything about cooling atoms but said we could work together on it, so I was given a post-doctoral appointment. Later, the Rowland Institute gave me a staff job and my own laboratory.''         Although she is a permanent United States resident, Dr. Hau has not applied for citizenship.         ''I would like to be a citizen so I could vote,'' she said, ''but I would have to give up Danish citizenship, and that would make me feel disloyal. Last week the Danish comedian and pianist Victor Borge performed in Boston for two straight hours -- and it was hilarious -- even though he is 90 years old. Now there's a Dane for you, one to make you feel proud.''         Although much of Dr. Hau's work is done on a blackboard, she is also a ''dirty hands'' physicist who builds and adjusts much of her own complex apparatus.         In 1994, she and Dr. Golovchenko designed and built an ingenious atomic beam source called the ''candlestick,'' which is now a part of Dr. Lau's light-slowing apparatus. The device incorporates a ''wick'' made of gold-plated stainless-steel cloth, which soaks up hot molten sodium metal and wicks the sodium up to a heater that vaporizes it. A jet of hot sodium atoms then shoots out of a pinhole into the cooling apparatus that chills them to a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero.         An atom at room temperature moves at high speed, but when it is bombarded from three directions by laser beams it loses energy and slows down: it cools off. In a complicated series of stages, Dr. Hau's apparatus uses lasers to cool the sodium atoms part way, and then evaporates the fastest (and therefore hottest) of them, saving the coolest in the trap. At the end of this cooling operation (which takes 38 seconds), the cloud of atoms in the trap has been reduced to only 50 one-billionths of a degree above absolute zero, a temperature far colder than any in nature, even in the depths of space.         Because of the Uncertainty Principle -- one of the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics -- the more precisely the momentum (or velocity) of a particle is known, the less precisely is it possible to measure its position, and vice versa. At exactly zero degrees (which in practice could never be reached), a particle would have zero momentum, a precise value. This would mean that the particle's position would be highly uncertain; it might be found anywhere within a large volume of possible places.         The volume occupied by each ultra-cold sodium atom in Dr. Hau's trap expands enormously, so much so that atoms in the trap are forced to overlap and merge into what physicists call a Bose-Einstein condensate (named for the theorists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein), in which the atoms' quantum wave functions are combined.         Once the condensate is created, a ''coupling'' laser tuned to resonate with the trapped mass of atoms is beamed into the trap chamber so that the atoms and photons of light become ''entangled'' with each other, behaving as if they were a single entity. A pulsed laser probe is then shot into the ''laser dressed'' condensate from a different direction, and some of its light passes through, but at a speed 20 million times as slow as the speed of light in a vacuum.         A table covered with a labyrinth of little mirrors guides a network of beams requiring perfect adjustment, and Dr. Hau and her team work long and tedious hours, sometimes around the clock. Their eyes become strained from exposure to the glaring yellow laser spots reflected from the apparatus.         ''Of course, we have to eat while we work, and we like pepperoni pizza, but we have to be careful to keep the optical system clean,'' she said. ''Each cooling cycle for the sodium atoms takes 38 seconds, and that gives us just enough time to take a bite of pizza, change hands and flip up one of the mirrors in the optical system to prepare for the next cooling cycle. It takes some practice.''         Dr. Hau is considering an experiment to measure localized wave functions in the cooled atom trap, allowing her to explore the structure of the condensate.         ''Some people think it might be dangerous, that the trap might explode. But the most worthwhile physics is often a bit dangerous,'' she said.         ''When you're looking at the computer monitor and you suddenly see what you had hoped you would find,'' she added, ''it's the greatest feeling in the world.''         SCIENTIST AT WORK: LENE VESTERGAARD HAU       
         Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 94.         In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West, as Harriet Waddy was then known, made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging black women to get into uniform.         She said that joining the segregated military ''and accepting a situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not ''a retreat from our fight'' but ''our contribution to its realization.''         The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.         Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.         ''Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''She looked good, and she was well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''         Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.         Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West ''had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand her baggage from the train.''         Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ''all reference to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from official memorandums on information boards. She said that would bring ''less embarrassment to the colored personnel'' and a ''feeling that a forward step has been made toward democracy.''         Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks gain acceptance. She said that military service would give black women a chance to ''show their ability'' and be ''of future benefit to the whole race.''         Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20, 1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later a civilian adviser to the WAC.         She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps center in Oregon.         A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were divorced.         Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs. Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90's. Mrs. Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said, ''The Frank Sinatra song 'My Way' was just perfect.''       
         Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce, founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone, N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.         Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Mr. Luce's children, was a leading figure in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.         Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important role in the life of Mr. Luce, who sought her advice even after they were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and the author of ''Henry R. Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).         Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.         The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after Mr. Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and interests better matched his own. ''Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his intention to divorce her,'' Dr. Herzstein said. ''But they maintained a closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their children's education and careers, among other things.''         Mrs. Tyng and Mr. Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce 3d,  chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.         In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York society, serving on the boards of several institutions,  including the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service  and the Grosvenor Neighborhood House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.         Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Vera Tolstoy, a Russian refugee who became a teen-age bride in Czechoslovakia, worked as a hairdresser in Prague, sang Gypsy songs in Paris, sold perfume in New York and spent 25 years with the Voice of America in Washington, died on Monday at her retirement home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 96 and the last living link to her grandfather Leo Tolstoy.         To the world of the early 1900's, Leo Tolstoy was a literary giant who had become the ''hermit of Yasnaya Polyana,'' the luxurious family estate 150 miles south of Moscow where he lived for 48 years and wrote  ''Anna Karenina'' and ''War and Peace.''         To his granddaughter, who grew up on a nearby estate with her mother, Sophia, and father, Ilya, the author's second son, he was simply her beloved bushy-faced dedushka, the jolly man in a peasant shirt who bounced her on his knee and tickled her cheek with his whiskers.         A small, lively woman who could affect a magisterial air, Miss Tolstoy dropped her hereditary title, Countess, after she came to the United States in 1949, but as an aristocratic exercise of noblesse oblige saw no reason to correct friends who continued to address her that way.         Although she sometimes found the name Tolstoy a burden, and even called herself Vera Mansoureva (after her mother's family estate) during her years as a Russian-language broadcaster, she was proud enough of her family connections to regale friends with tales of the old days at Yasnaya Polyana and to give lectures on her family heritage.         As a second-generation descendant of a man who had 13 children (and now has some 200 living descendants) Miss Tolstoy, the youngest of seven surviving siblings, liked to call herself Tolstoy's last granddaughter and never mind that a cousin from the Swedish branch of the family might still be alive.         As she made clear to relatives, the Swedish branch, descended from  Tolstoy's son Leo didn't count since they didn't speak Russian.         For Miss Tolstoy, who was 7 when her grandfather died in 1910 and 10 when the outbreak of World War I gave her father an excuse to desert his family (he eventually settled in the United States and remarried), the aristocratic life was short-lived.         After the Russian Revolution she and her mother made a harrowing escape, eventually landing in Czechoslovakia, where Miss Tolstoy got a job as translator for a wealthy lumber merchant, Odo Bakovsky, and then married him in an Islamic ceremony, giving birth to a son, Serge, in 1922.         Five years later, after her husband had lost his money and, she said, become unfaithful and quarrelsome, she sought to have the marriage declared illegal, explaining that she would rather have an annulment than a divorce because as a prospective single mother she preferred to have an illegitimate Tolstoy than a legitimate Bakovsky.         Miss Tolstoy, whose son had been kidnapped by his father then rekidnapped by her, had to settle for a divorce, but her son, her only immediate survivor, who now lives in Washington, is known as Serge Tolstoy.         After supporting her mother and son by working as a hairdresser in Prague, Miss Tolstoy moved to Paris after her mother's death in the 1930's and worked as a nightclub singer.         It was her aunt Alexandra Tolstoy,  founder of the Tolstoy Foundation in Valley Cottage, N.Y., who sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1949. After a brief stay at the foundation's farm and a stint selling perfume for Elizabeth Arden in New York, she moved to Washington in 1954 and Florida in 1979.         In 1991 she went back to Russia for a family reunion that drew dozens of Tolstoys, including many who had remained in the Soviet Union, to Yasnaya Polyana, a museum that is virtually a shrine.         Finding the house much as she remembered it, including the formal dining room table with its elegant china and fine silver covered by a glass dome and her grandfather's signature wide-brim hat and peasant shirt hanging next to his washstand, Miss Tolstoy was in her element, spotting a photograph taken with her grandfather when she was 3, but not finding every detail to her liking.         When she saw an alabaster monument to Lenin, a distinct incongruity in a museum devoted to a member of the Russian nobility, Miss Tolstoy responded first by using an American barnyard epithet, then reverted to aristocratic type.         ''That statue,'' she said, poking her walking stick at the offensive item, and using her most imperious voice, ''should be taken away.''       
         Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised awareness of the disease, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor, her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine, which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days before her death, she was working on the June issue.         When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles. She became the third reigning British editor of an important New York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing Talk magazine.         The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics: speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of $1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in the years they competed in New York.)         Ms. Tilberis's aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said, was to make it ''the most beautiful fashion magazine in the world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style,  which was widely copied.         The first issue under Ms. Tilberis's direction, September 1992, had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of the model Linda Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with no other headline on the cover than ''Enter the Era of Elegance.'' It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover of Madonna, also photographed by Mr. Demarchelier, in striking black and red.         Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed. Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards in 1993.         In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the Princess of Wales. The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The Princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms. Tilberis's editorship, once during her lifetime and once posthumously.         The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ''Ovarian Cancer: One Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility drugs in the late 1970's to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The article described the disease and its treatment, which included nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30 pounds.         In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short length as it had been as a chin-length bob.         She also discussed her battle with the disease in ''No Time to Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.         Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft contact lenses in the 1960's.         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and Christopher, 14.         In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top, becoming editor in chief in 1987.         Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene, serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS, the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive director. ''We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said yesterday.         Despite Ms. Tilberis's personal popularity and the publicity her tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.         Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the magazine in an interview in 1995. ''I think we made the niche we wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I wanted to create,'' she said.         In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her illness: ''You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an important balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's a great wake-up call.''       
         Felicia Gizycka Magruder, an American heiress who was kidnapped as a child by her father, a continental count, died on Feb. 26 at the Regency retirement community in Laramie, Wyo. She was 93 and moved to Laramie from New Canaan, Conn., in 1995.         Mrs. Magruder was the former Countess Felicia Gizycka, the only daughter of the Chicago-born newspaper heiress Eleanor Medill Patterson and Count Josef Gizycki, a fortune-hunting scion of a noble Polish family. Ms. Patterson, who eventually divorced the count, was a granddaughter of Joseph Medill, the founder of The Chicago Tribune.         The little Countess Felicia, as the newspapers later called her, was born in 1905 in Blansko in what is now the Czech Republic.         In 1908, when Felicia was a golden-haired, blue-eyed toddler, The New York Times reported that she had been ''kidnapped in London by the Count,'' who ''is thought to be either in Vienna or St. Petersburg and has concealed the child.'' The Times said that earlier ''the Countess ran away from him with her child one night after a violent quarrel.''         The ensuing custody struggle led President-elect William Howard Taft to intervene with Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in whose realm the Gizycki family estates were located. In December 1908, Taft wrote the Czar pointing out Felicia's mother's connection to Russia and saying that the count had put the kidnapped toddler in a convent in Russia. Taft asked the Czar to ''make such order to Count Gizycki as shall seem to Your Majesty equitable.''         The Czar commanded the count to return Felicia to her mother, and when that happened, as one Patterson biographer has written, ''they caught the first train for Germany and from there took the first steamship to America.''         Lake Forest, Ill. became their home. Mrs. Magruder's mother also bought a ranch in Wyoming, and there, as The Laramie Daily Boomerang reported in its obituary of Mrs. Magruder, an able young journalist named Drew Pearson ''came out to court Felicia.''         But things did not go smoothly, and the teen-age countess ''caught a train to San Diego, where she took an assumed name and supported herself as a waitress.'' In a 1939 interview she said, ''I tell you, I was good'' as a waitress.         ''I could swing a mean tray,'' she added. ''I always wanted to make my own way in life -- it gives one a nice feeling.''         Undeterred, Pearson caught up with her. He is said to have made her a practical offer: ''Look, you're only 18. Marry me now and in three years, if you don't love me, you can leave and start your life all over again.'' Their marriage began in 1925, produced a daughter, Ellen, and was ended in divorce by Mrs. Pearson after three years.         But what years they were, with the promising Pearson, who was not yet the mighty syndicated columnist he later became, taking his young wife  to China and beyond, while he polished his journalistic skills.         In later years she wrote for American magazines and newspapers, lived in New York and elsewhere, and wrote novels and short stories.  In her 1939 novel ''Flower of Smoke,'' the Austrian-American heroine says, ''Make your own peace, no matter what.''         After living for years in New Canaan she moved for good to Wyoming, where she had relatives.         Her 1934 marriage to an Englishman, Dudley de Lavigne, ended in divorce. Her 1958 marriage to John Kennedy Magruder, a landscape architect and a director of the Alcoholics Anonymous Men's Home in Alexandria, Va., also ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Pearson Arnold of San Diego; three grandsons, Joe and Drew Arnold of Laramie and George Arnold of Evanston, Wyo.; a granddaughter, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.         Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.         Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States, conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and infants.         ''No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work, said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park. ''There had been little empirical observation.''         Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants need a ''secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ''anxious'' attachments can lead to problems later in life. ''She looked at a way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were not,'' Dr. Cassidy said.         Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.         ''That was a huge controversy over that,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''It had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive place and leads to less crying long term.''         Psychologists continue to debate the issue.         Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure attachment between infant and mother.         ''These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S. Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.         Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the university's psychology department until 1942, when she was commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor in 1946.         In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where she began a lifelong partnership with Dr. Bowlby, who was investigating the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.         In 1955 she moved to Baltimore, where she joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. She became a full professor there in 1963, a year after she began her study of infant-mother attachment. In the study, she and her researchers conducted four-hour home visits every three weeks for a year with 26 mothers and their infants. It took four years to collect the data and 10 years to analyze it.         ''The depth has never been matched,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''No one has done it as intensively.''         In 1974 Dr. Ainsworth, who was divorced from her husband in 1960, moved to Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, where she was a professor from 1975 to 1984. She retired as professor emeritus in 1984 and remained professionally active until 1992.         She wrote several books and many academic papers, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1966 and 1967. She also received several awards from professional organizations. Last year she was awarded the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Sloan of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
         Mary Lutyens, a well-born English  biographer and novelist who was applauded by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, died on April 9 in London. She was 90 and lived in London and the English county of Dorset.         Miss Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) was a daughter of Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869-1944), the British architect who planned New Delhi and many of its Government buildings, including the Viceroy's palace. Her mother was Lady Emily Lutyens, daughter of the First Earl of Lytton, a poet and a Viceroy of India.         Not surprisingly, Mary Lutyens was worldly as well as literary. In London, The Independent noted,  ''She was famous for her dry martinis and her elegance and, although unmusical, danced alone to Cole Porter for exercise.'' As a writer, she won praise for the accuracy and readability of her biographies, which included ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (1968). Sir John Everett Millais (1829-96) was a handsome British painter and a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in Britain. John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a British social theorist and critic whose wife, Effie, fell in love with Millais.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn G. Heilbrun noted: ''Mary Lutyens has now restored to England the Davis Cup for the editing of Victorian letters -- a trophy long in American hands. In 'Millais and the Ruskins,' combining exemplary scholarship with editing that is at once tactful and informative, she uses many previously unpublished letters by eminent Victorians to tell a passionate and moving story. Her book will be equally valuable to the Victorian scholar and to what used to be called the general reader.''         Miss Lutyens was the editor of a related book-length collection of letters, ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice,'' which was described in The Times Book Review by another critic, Joan Evans, as ''admirably and discreetly edited.''         Miss Lutyens also wrote several authoritative books about the Indian spiritual philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurt (1895-1986). They include ''Krishnamurti: The Open Door'' (1991).         Her more than a dozen works of fiction include ''Cleo'' (1974), which Martin Levin in The Times Book Review called a ''flawless tour de force.''         She also wrote fiction under the pseudonym Esther Wyndham.         Miss Lutyens was born in London and educated privately before attending Queens College, London. She  became a writer in her early 20's.         She married Anthony Sewell in 1930 and the couple were divorced in 1945. Later that year she married J. G. Links, an art expert known as Joe, who died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Amanda.       
         Sheila Gruson, an artist who worked as an assistant director  with many opera companies around the world, died yesterday in Tiverton, in Devon, England. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, according to her brother, Lindsey.         Ms. Gruson, who lived in Tiverton, was an assistant director with Covent Garden in London and La Fenice in Venice, as well as with opera companies in New York, Hamburg, San Francisco, Seattle and Munich.         Her sculptures were exhibited in England.         Ms. Gruson was born on March 21, 1951, in Tel Aviv, and graduated from Harvard University in 1972. She was a daughter of Sydney Gruson, a former vice chairman of The New York Times Company, who died last year.         Besides her brother, of Kent, Conn., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Lourie, of Tiverton; her mother, Flora Lewis, of Paris, foreign affairs columnist for The International Herald Tribune, and a sister, Kerry Gruson of Miami.       
         Ida Klaus, a labor law pioneer who became a high-ranking New York City official in the 1950's and who wrote the law that gave city employees the right to bargain collectively, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Ms. Klaus was a lifelong labor advocate whose sympathy for the working classes was instilled in her by her mother. As a young child growing up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, she helped give free food from the family grocery to striking factory workers.         She organized her first union while still in her teens. She was one of three college women working as a waitress in the summer with several professional waiters at the Gross & Baum Hotel in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. One day, she heard that the hotel planned to lay off some of the waiters.         ''I don't know where I got the nerve, but I said, 'Let's get together and have a meeting,' '' she said in a 1974 interview in The New York Times.         Ms. Klaus became the spokeswoman for the waiters and waitresses, and told the hotel management that if anyone was discharged, they would all go.         ''At which point, Mr. Baum said he knew he shouldn't have hired college girls,'' she recalled. ''But he didn't fire anyone.''         Ms. Klaus's desire to become a lawyer also derived from the experience of watching her mother battle  the court system for 10 years over her husband's estate.         But after graduating from Hunter College and, in 1925, from the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, now the  Albert A. List College, she was denied admission to Columbia University Law School because she was a woman.         She taught Hebrew until 1928, when she was admitted to the law school with the first class to accept women. She received her law degree in 1931.         After graduation, Ms. Klaus worked as a review lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board in Washington. In 1948, she took the post of solicitor for the National Labor Relations Board, a position that made her the highest-ranking female lawyer in the Federal Government.         In 1954, she was hired as counsel to the New York City Department of Labor under Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She became known as the author of the so-called Little Wagner Act, the city version of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which recognized workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively through unions of their choosing. The Federal Wagner Act was named for the Mayor's father, Senator Robert F. Wagner.         She also wrote Mayor Wagner's executive order creating the first detailed code of labor relations for city employees.         ''She is one of the pioneers and champions of bringing law and order into labor relations,'' said Robert S. Rifkind, a lawyer and longtime friend whose father, Simon H. Rifkind, was a law clerk for Ms. Klaus. ''She believed labor relations ought not to be under the rule of tooth and claw.''         Ms. Klaus briefly worked in the Kennedy Administration in 1961 as a consultant for the first labor relations task force for Federal employees.         She returned to New York in 1962 as director of staff relations for the  Board of Education, where she negotiated what was reported to be the first citywide teachers' contract in the country.         She left in 1975 to become a private arbitrator. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her one of the three negotiators in the Long Island Rail Road strike.         Ms. Klaus, who was born on Jan. 8, 1905, received Columbia Law School's Medal for Excellence in 1996, and an honorary doctorate in 1994 from the Jewish Theological Seminary.         No close relatives survive.       
         Alice Adams, widely admired for her deft, elegantly observed novels and short stories, died yesterday at her home in San Francisco. She was 72.         She had been treated for heart problems earlier in the week and seemed to have died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria Wilson.         In 10 novels and five collections of short stories, Ms. Adams created richly textured, artfully constructed novels about women's lives that sometimes mirrored and sometimes anticipated changes in the society as a whole. Admirers particularly praised her ability to capture place and voice and the deceptively artful craft of her writing.         Ms. Adams was born Aug. 14, 1926, in Fredericksburg, Va., grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., was educated at Harvard, and spent most of her adult life in San Francisco, and her writing in many ways fused the seductive intimacy of the South, the intellectual sophistication of New England and the sense of adventure and openness to new experiences of the West.         ''She was just so deft and had such a wonderful touch,'' said Ms. Wilson, her editor for 25 years at Knopf, where she published all of her short-story collections and all but one of her novels. Another novel, ''After the War,'' has been completed and will be published next year. ''She was a master at condensing so much, with so much resonance, into a short form,'' Ms. Wilson added.         Alice Adams lived a life full of enough energy, contradiction and nuance that it would have made an apt subject for her own fiction. She was the only child of Agatha Erskine (Boyd) Adams and Nicholson Barney Adams. Her father was a Spanish professor at the University of North Carolina, her mother a frustrated writer full of unfulfilled literary aspirations. Ms. Adams described her family as ''three difficult, isolated people.''         She graduated from high school at 15, at which point, she once said, she ''ran into trouble because of that Southern thing that women are supposed to be stupid.''         She went to Radcliffe College, where she graduated at the age of 19 and soon married a fellow Harvard student, Mark Linenthal. The couple spent their first year together in Paris, where she soon realized the marriage was a mistake. ''I loved Paris,'' she said later, ''except I disliked him so much.''         The couple moved to San Francisco in 1948, where she found little time to pursue her writing. Eventually the couple divorced in 1958. Struggling to raise their only son, Peter, who survives her, she began writing seriously soon after while holding a variety of bookkeeping and clerical jobs. She published her first novel, ''Careless Love,'' to mixed reviews and after years of struggling to establish herself published her first short story for The New Yorker in 1969. She became one of the magazine's most distinctive fictional voices, eventually publishing more than 25 short stories there.         She soon established herself as a skillful, widely admired short-story writer and her second novel, ''Families and Survivors,'' the odyssey of a woman who moves from the South to San Francisco and from relationship to relationship, was published by Knopf in 1975. Reviewers either loved it or hated it, but it established her as a serious literary presence. That novel was followed by ''Listening to Billie'' in 1978 and the short-story collection ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1979. The Washington Post Book World compared the book to the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald ''in both style and subject matter.'' She had her greatest success with ''Superior Women'' in 1984, which became a best seller and traced the lives of five Radcliffe women from 1943 to 1983. Admirers saw it as fusing the sensibilities of Jane Austen and Mary McCarthy.         Not everyone was so enamored. Some critics found her work mannered and humorless. But she became a consistent seller, who was widely admired and sometimes imitated by other writers.         ''No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' said Fran Kiernan, a former New Yorker editor, who edited Ms. Adams's New Yorker stories for 10 years, beginning with ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1977. ''She was a great romantic, with the highest expectations of life. As a writer, she was unfailingly wise.''         Ms. Adams's stories have appeared in 22 O'Henry Awards collections and in several volumes of ''Best American Short Stories.'' She received an Academy and Institute Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         Tall and striking looking, with short blond hair, turning gray, Ms. Adams was known for her sense of style as well as for her liberal politics and her wry view of life.         Describing the difficulty of writing as one ages, she said, ''Some smart person once said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.''       
         Marjorie Lederer Lee, a novelist and poet, died Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, her son John said.         Ms. Lee drew on her experiences as a young mother of five in Bryn Mawr, Pa., to write about suburbanites in her first novel, ''The Lion House.'' Among her other works were the novels ''The Eye of Summer'' and ''Dr. Block and the Human Condition'' and a book of poetry,  ''What Have You Done All Day.''         Ms. Lee, who was born Marjorie Ruth Lederer in Manhattan, began writing at a young age. By the time she was 13, her poetry and short stories had appeared in publications like Mademoiselle, Harper's Bazaar and McCall's.         She was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, to which she had earned a full scholarship. While a student there, she wrote the words to the Sarah Lawrence College song, set to a 17th-century Dutch carol. The song had its premiere at her  commencement ceremony in 1944. It fell out of use by the early 1950's.         After college, she married Robert Lee and in her early 20's was the poetry editor of The Ladies' Home Journal. Several of her own poems were set to music and performed by Dinah Shore and Martha Raye, among others.         In her youth, Ms. Lee was the constant companion of her first cousin Richard Avedon, the photographer.         ''She was the source of my energy, the front-runner of everything intellectual, inventive and original in our most formative years,'' Mr. Avedon said.         In addition to her son John, of Manhattan, she is survived by two other sons, Robert Jr., of Haverford, Pa., and Steven, of West Nyack, N.Y.; two daughters, Alison, of Berkeley, Calif., and Jordan, of Nashville, and nine grandchildren.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Sylvia Sidney, whose vulnerable but spunky persona helped make her the ultimate heroine of realistic movies of the 1930's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Sidney determined to be an actress at the age of 15 and perfected her artistry over six decades in a versatile mix of 40 films and 100 classical and modern plays.         In her 20's, the petite actress with a heart-shaped face, large, moist eyes and a tremulous voice played anguished film heroines in Rouben Mamoulian's ''City Streets,'' Theodore Dreiser and Josef von Sternberg's ''American Tragedy,'' Elmer Rice and King Vidor's ''Street Scene,'' Sidney Kingsley's ''Dead End'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Sabotage.'' She also starred in the first three American films directed by Fritz Lang: ''Fury,'' ''You Only Live Once'' and ''You and Me.''         In Lang's stark cinema of social injustice, the film historian David Thomson wrote, the actress ''caught exactly the fragile happiness allowed in Lang's world and played with a restraint that perfectly matched the fatal simplicity of the plots. There are close-ups in 'Fury' of Sidney watching Spencer Tracy in a burning jail, as harrowed as any Lillian Gish close-ups'' in D. W. Griffith's silent film masterpieces.         Miss Sidney was grateful for tutelage from her first film directors. In 1977 she remarked: ''King Vidor and Mamoulian, of course, I adored. Fritz Lang and I became dear friends, though we had awful fights.'' But producers were reluctant to free her from type-casting, prompting her to deplore her repetitious roles as ''the girl of the gangster, then the sister who was bringing up the gangster, then later the mother of the gangster, and they always had me ironing somebody's shirt.''         Miss Sidney also resented being treated as studio property. She considered herself not a star, but an actress. Eventually she expanded her gallery of screen characters to include a chic Eurasian double-agent in ''Blood on the Sun'' (1945), an idealistic journalist in ''The Searching Wind'' (1946), a drudge in ''Les Miserables'' (1952) and a hard-bitten matriarch in ''Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams'' (1973), for which she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress. In the 1980's her films included ''Hammett,'' ''Corrupt'' and ''Beetlejuice,'' directed by Tim Burton. In 1996 she appeared in a cameo as a prairie woman in Mr. Burton's ''Mars Attacks!'' as a favor to the director for casting her in ''Beetlejuice'' as a chain-smoking ghoul, a role she thought was ''great,'' said John Springer, her friend and publicist.         On Broadway, Miss Sidney appeared in Ben Hecht's ''To Quito and Back'' (1937), Irwin Shaw's ''Gentle People'' (with the Group Theater, 1939), Carl Reiner and Joseph Stein's ''Enter Laughing'' (1963) and Tennessee Williams's ''Vieux Carre'' (1977).         Her richly varied tour and stock performances included ''Pygmalion,'' ''Angel Street,'' ''Jane Eyre,'' ''Joan of Lorraine,'' ''Kind Lady,'' ''O Mistress Mine,'' ''Anne of the Thousand Days,'' ''The Rivals,'' ''The Madwoman of Chaillot,'' ''The Little Foxes,'' ''The Importance of Being Earnest,'' ''She Stoops to Conquer,'' ''The Glass Menagerie,'' ''Cabaret,'' ''Sweet Bird of Youth,'' ''Butterflies Are Free'' and '' 'Night, Mother.''         Among Miss Sidney's dozens of starring television roles were acclaimed performances as a cancer-ridden patient in a hospice in the 1980 play ''The Shadow Box'' and as plain-spoken but compassionate grandmothers of homosexual AIDS patients in ''An Early Frost'' in 1985 and in ''Andre's Mother'' in 1990. Miss Sidney last appeared on screen in 1998 in several episodes of ABC's new version of ''Fantasy Island,'' for which she had a seven-year contract for a recurring role, Mr. Springer said. The show was canceled.         Sylvia Sidney, originally named Sophia Kossow, was born in the Bronx on Aug. 8, 1910, to Victor Kossow, a clothing salesman, and the former Rebecca Saperstein. Her parents were divorced when she was 9, and soon after she was adopted by her mother's second husband, Dr. Sigmund Sidney, a dentist.         Shy and a stutterer, she was given elocution and dancing lessons starting at the age of 10. As a teen-ager, she left Washington Irving High School to study acting at the Theater Guild school in Manhattan and was soon expelled for staying out late. Nonetheless, she obtained a dozen roles and favorable notices in Broadway plays, including a 1928 drama, ''Gods of the Lightning,'' and a 1930 comedy, ''Bad Girl.'' They won her a contract with Paramount Pictures and opened her path to fame.         Her main recreation at her homes in Roxbury and later Danbury, Conn., was needlework. Her designs are sold as kits, and she wrote two popular instruction books on the art: ''Sylvia Sidney's Needlepoint Book'' (1968) and ''The Sylvia Sidney Question and Answer Book on Needlepoint'' (1975).         Miss Sidney's three marriages all ended in divorce. Her husbands were Bennett Cerf, the publisher; Luther Adler, the actor, and Carlton Alsop, a publicity agent. With Mr. Adler, she had a son, Jacob (Jody) Adler, who died in 1987 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also called Lou Gehrig's disease. His illness prompted her to become a dedicated volunteer for the National A.L.S. Foundation. No immediate family members survive.         Ms. Sidney regarded her life and her career as inseparable. ''There isn't a role that I wouldn't accept, provided it's good and has something to say,'' she told an interviewer in 1975. ''I wouldn't know what to do with myself if I retired. I'm an actress, and I have to work.''         Correction:  July 3, 1999, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Sylvia Sidney yesterday misspelled her original surname. It was Kosow, not Kossow.         The obituary also omitted two survivors. They are her half-brothers, Albert C. Kosow of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Edgar J. Kosow of Plantation, Fla.       
         Constance Shacklock, an English mezzo-soprano who made more than 500 appearances at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden between 1946 and 1956, and then undertook a second stage career in musical theater, died on Tuesday. She was 86.         Ms. Shacklock was born in Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham, and studied voice at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She made her debut at Covent Garden in a 1946 production of Purcell's ''The Fairy Queen,'' and quickly proved herself an invaluable member of the company. She was particularly renowned for her portrayal of Brangaene, in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde,'' a role she first sang at Covent Garden in 1948. Her performances as Amneris in Verdi's ''Aida,'' Queen Elizabeth I in Britten's ''Gloriana,'' Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome'' and Magdalene in Wagner's ''Meistersinger'' were also highly regarded.         She also made frequent concert appearances, and was known both for her rendering of the Angel's music in Elgar's ''Dream of Gerontius,'' and rousing performances of ''Rule Britannia'' and ''Jerusalem'' at the annual summer music festival called the Proms. The highlight of her career in musical theater was a six-year run as the Mother Abbess in the London production of ''The Sound of Music,'' starting in 1961.         Ms. Shacklock was a professor at the Royal Academy of Music from 1968 to 1984, and became president of the Association of Teachers of Singing in 1995. Among her awards was the Order of the British Empire, which she received in 1971.         She is survived by a daughter, Jean Tredaway.       
         Gina Berriault, an award-winning writer of short stories and novels, died on July 15 at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Sausalito, Calif.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         With her terse prose, emotional precision and deft storytelling, Ms. Berriault was often heralded as ''a writer's writer.''         Her 1996 collection of 35 short stories, ''Women in Their Beds,'' received critical acclaim and won the 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Fiction Prize and the Rae Award for the Short Story. Tobin Harshaw, reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, wrote: ''One struggles to find a sentence that is anything less than jewel-box perfect.''         Born Arline Shandling in Long Beach, Calif., to parents who had emigrated from Latvia and Lithuania, Ms. Berriault spent much of her childhood in Los Angeles, where her father wrote and edited trade magazines. After his death when she was a teen-ager, she took over his work to help support her family.         She married John Berriault and settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, writing stories and magazine articles while raising a daughter. By the late 1950's, she had collected a bevy of awards in the short-story field, among them the Paris Review's Aga Khan fiction prize and two O. Henry awards.         Her first novel, ''The Descent,'' was published in 1960. Set in America in 1964, the story described the conflict between the Secretary for Humanity, a newly created Cabinet post, and a group of people who believed that moving to underground shelters would manifest ''prepared togetherness.''         Her second novel, ''Conference of Victims,'' about the suicide of a Congressional candidate, was published two years later, and was revised and republished in 1998 as ''Afterwards.''         Her other novels include ''The Son'' (1966), about an incestuous relationship between a mother and her son; ''The Lights of Earth'' (1984), about a woman and her married lover. She also published two other  short-story collections, ''The Mistress'' (1965) and ''The Infinite Passion of Expectation'' (1982).         Her short story ''The Stone Boy,'' which she adapted for the screen, was made into the 1984 film starring Robert Duvall and Glenn Close. She had recently completed a fable, ''The Great Petrowski,'' that was to be published with her own illustrations.         She is survived by a daughter, Julie Berriault of Mill Valley, Calif., and her companion, Leonard Gardner of Sausalito.       
         Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where she lived. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a spokesman with the United States Embassy in Santiago.         Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said,  ''Anyone who was involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially taking the lead, was courageous.''         In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting of those who vanished under General Pinochet and prosecution of those involved in their deaths.         In the past year, she led protests in London in support of General Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83, is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years in power, from 1973 to 1990.         ''The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family. She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in 1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later, mother of three children.         In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American Government, General Pinochet overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Mr. Pizarro, a Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret police run by the Chilean armed forces.         More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under General Pinochet are still unaccounted for.         Two days after Mr. Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed her the time to search for her husband and work with the Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son, Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and sisters.         Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Pizarro hanging around her neck.         Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from prosecution .         Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.         Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of General Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization called ''They Dance Alone.''         The current democratic Government in Chile issued a statement mourning Ms. Sierra's death.         Secretary General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the Government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must have felt. ''Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without knowing the truth,'' Mr. Mladinic said. 'I hope that in the near future this pain will end.''       
         Sherley Anne Williams, a daughter of migrant workers who became an award-winning novelist, poet and playwright as well as a professor at the University of California, died on July 6 at a hospital in San Diego. She was 54 and lived in San Diego.         The cause was cancer, Kate Callen, a university spokeswoman, said.         Ms. Williams fused her experiences in the dusty cotton fields and fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley with historical research to articulate the African-American experience.         In 1986, when she was already a celebrated poet, she ventured successfully into fiction with the historical novel ''Dessa Rose.''         A story of relationships, particularly the one between a privileged Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave sentenced to die after the birth of her baby, the work was praised by David Bradley in The New York Times as ''artistically brilliant, emotionally affecting and totally unforgettable.''         Ms. Williams's language, infused with rhythm and image, transcended the boundaries of genre.         ''While Ms. Williams shows that she can write a novel better than a lot of novelists, nowhere does she cut herself off from her poetic roots,'' wrote Mr. Bradley, citing a passage in which the character Dessa recalls her lover, Kaine:         ''Kaine, his voice high and clear as running water over a settled stream bed, swooping to her through her. . . . He walked the lane between the indifferently rowed cabins like he owned them, striding from shade into half-light as if he could halt the setting sun. . . . Talk as beautiful as his touch. . . . Kaine's eyes had been the color of lemon tea and honey. Even now against closed eyelids, she could see them.''         At her death, Ms. Williams was working on a sequel to ''Dessa Rose'' and on a novel set in the 20th century.         Her first book of verse, ''The Peacock Poems,'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975.         She won an Emmy Award for a television performance of poems from her second book of verse, ''Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' which was another National Book Award nominee. Her one-woman drama, ''Letters From a New England Negro,'' was performed at the National Black Theater Festival in 1991 and at the Chicago International Theater Festival in 1992.         ''Working Cotton,'' a 1992 children's tale, won an American Library Association Caldecott Award and a Coretta Scott King Book Award, and was listed among the best books of 1992 by Parents magazine. Ms. Williams had recently published a second children's book, ''Girls Together.''         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., she grew up in Fresno, where her family worked as migrant workers. Her father died when she was 8, her mother when she was 16. After that she survived by picking crops in the same fields where her parents had toiled. Her upbringing, she later said, ''was the most deprived, provincial kind of existence you can think of.''         Though an impassioned reader, Ms. Williams had been discouraged from that activity by her mother, who felt she might be introduced to ambitions she would have no possibility of fulfilling. But in the eighth grade, a science teacher saw promise and urged her to enroll in college preparatory courses. In high school, she realized a love of language and was encouraged to apply to college.         The change was unsettling, she later recounted. ''To go from having no prospects at all to having seemingly limitless opportunity . . . well, in my case, I feel I just wasn't prepared for seemingly limitless opportunity.''         As a freshman at Fresno State University, she discovered the work of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown, who she claimed were her earliest influences. ''I was just captivated by their language, their speech and their character because I always liked the way black people talk,'' she said. ''So I wanted to work that in writing.''         After completing a master's degree in American literature at Brown University, she joined the literature department at the University of California at San Diego in 1973 and remained there until shortly before her death.         She is survived by a son, John Malcolm Stewart of Lancaster, Calif.; a sister, Ruby Birdson, and three grandchildren.       
         Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, whose marriage to John F. Kennedy Jr. catapulted her and her understated glamour to fame, was reported lost and presumed dead on a flight Friday to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., along with her husband and her sister Lauren Bessette.         She was 33.         Until shortly before her marriage, Ms. Bessette was an executive at Calvin Klein Ltd. in New York. Her rise there -- from saleswoman in Boston to director of publicity for Mr. Klein's flagship line -- had been fast, but her achievements were quickly overshadowed by her relationship with Mr. Kennedy, whom she married in 1996.         After her marriage, she quickly became a fashion icon herself, on the cover of numerous magazines.         She soon settled into the role of Kennedy wife, with all the public appearances and public attention that entailed. But she kept a deliberately quiet profile.         ''She's a very private woman,'' Mr. Kennedy told USA Today in 1998. ''It's like you go from having a life you've built on your own terms and all of a sudden it's being snatched away from you.''         Ms. Bessette Kennedy grew up in affluent Greenwich, Conn. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother, Ann, a teacher and administrator, remarried, to Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon; the couple now live in Old Greenwich, Conn. Her father, William Bessette, an architectural engineer, lives in White Plains.         Ms. Bessette Kennedy had two sisters, Lauren and Lisa Ann, identical twins who were born 18 months before her.         Lauren Bessette, who graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., was a principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. She joined the company in 1993 and spent several years in Hong Kong.         Carolyn Bessette graduated from St. Mary's High School in Greenwich in 1983 and went on to Boston University, where she majored in elementary education. She graduated in January 1988 and was briefly a nightclub promoter. She then began working at Mr. Klein's Boston store.         A Calvin Klein executive brought her to the fashion house's headquarters in New York. She was hired to outfit the ''personals,'' friends of the house, among them celebrities and socialites.         Paul Wilmot, the former director of publicity for Calvin Klein who hired her, said he had been immediately stuck by her intelligence and poise. He said she easily juggled the demands of the job, which required a keen fashion sense and attention to countless administrative details.         She was promoted to director of publicity of the collection, a job that entailed working with fashion editors as well as coordinating the shows for the line.         She began dating Mr. Kennedy in 1994. Their relationship was relentlessly chronicled in the tabloid press, but their wedding, in front of 40 people in a rundown church on a secluded island off Georgia, was carefully scripted to elude publicity.         Usually dressed in black, she often wore her hair slicked back in a bun, and she favored simple clothing designers like Prada and Yohji Yamamoto.         Comparisons to her mother-in-law, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, were frequent -- the two shared a Roman Catholic heritage, a thin, athletic physique, a cultivated mystique and a fierce possessiveness of their privacy.         Since her marriage, Ms. Bessette Kennedy had largely shunned the fashion world. Along with her husband, she lent her presence, and sometimes her name, to numerous benefits and cultural events.         ''I don't think she particularly missed being in the fashion industry,'' said John Perry Barlow, a friend of the couple. ''She still had plenty to do to adjust to being Mrs. John F. Kennedy Jr.''         Correction:  July 20, 1999, Tuesday  The obituary of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy yesterday misidentified the college from which her sister Lauren graduated. It was William Smith College, not its affiliate, Hobart; both are in Geneva, N.Y.       
         Amaryllis Fleming, a British cellist who was particularly devoted to chamber music and the Baroque literature, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Nettlebed, near Oxford, England, where she lived. She was 73.         Ms. Fleming lived a colorful life, partly because she was born into a family with both pronounced creative abilities and strong social connections, but also because of her own musical abilities, which drew her into the orbits of the pianist Artur Schnabel, the violinist Joseph Szigeti, the cellists Pierre Fournier and Pablo Casals, the conductor Sir John Barbirolli and the guitarists Julian Bream and John Williams.         She made her public debut playing the Elgar Cello Concerto when she was 19, and went on to win several important prizes and competitions. She also appeared -- or at least, her arms and hands did -- in ''Connecting Rooms'' (1969), as the screen fingers of Bette Davis, who played a cellist in the film.         Ms. Fleming was born in 1925, the  daughter of the painter Augustus John and of Eve Fleming, the wife of a Maj. Valentine Fleming, Member of Parliament. Ms. Fleming had four half-brothers, the most famous of whom was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond spy novels. Until she was 24, Ms. Fleming believed that she was Eve Fleming's adopted daughter. Her discovery of the truth caused a rift with her mother but brought her closer to John, whose home in Wiltshire became a retreat for her.         Having taken up the cello at the age of 9, Ms. Fleming determined early that she would become a professional musician. In 1943 she enrolled at the Royal College of Music, where she studied with Ivor James. By the end of the following year she had performed on the BBC and made her concert debut. When she auditioned for Fournier at that time, he was so impressed that he offered to teach her at no charge. They soon began a romance that mellowed into a long-standing friendship. Ms. Fleming's mother, determined to separate her from Fournier, arranged for her to study first in Portugal and later with Casals in Prades, Spain.         Ms. Fleming never married, and left no immediate family.         In the early 1950's, Ms. Fleming won the Queen's Prize, in England, as well as the Munich International Competition. She gave the German premiere of the Elgar Concerto in Hamburg, with Barbirolli conducting, and performed as a member of the Loveday Trio, the Fidelio Ensemble and the Paganini Trio. Later she formed the Fleming Trio, which went through many personnel changes in the 1970's, but was one of her most highly regarded chamber music endeavors.         The most decisive influence on her career, though, was her meeting in the 1950's with E. M. W. Paul, a musicologist who introduced her to Baroque music played on period instruments. Under Paul's influence, she became one of the first cellists to become interested in incorporating musicological research into her performances of Baroque works. She began playing on both restored Stradivarius and Guarneri cellos, and on an Amati with a five-string layout that allowed her to play certain works -- including Bach's Sonatas for Viola da Gamba, and the Sixth Suite for Unaccompanied Cello -- without making the transpositions necessary on a four-string instrument.         Ms. Fleming continued to perform until 1993, when a stroke left her unable to play. But she continued to teach, an occupation to which she had devoted herself increasingly, starting in the 1970's, when she joined the faculty of the Royal College of Music. Her best-known student is the cellist Raphael Wallfisch.       
         Anita Carter, a member of country music's pioneering Carter Family and a star in her own right, died in her home in Goodlettsville, Tenn.,  near Nashville, on Thursday. She was 66.         The cause was not yet known, Lou Robin, her manager, told the Associated Press. Ms. Carter had rheumatoid arthritis for the last few years.         Ms. Carter was one of three daughters of Ezra and Maybelle Carter, who formed the country singing group the Carter Family along with her cousin, Sara, and A. P. Carter (Sara's husband and Ezra's brother).         In 1927 the Carter Family drove from their Virginia mountain home to Tennessee and during the next 16 years recorded some 250 songs, one of the most important and influential bodies of work in country and folk music.         As a child, Anita (born Ina Anita Carter in Maces Springs, Va.) hated to be separated from her mother when the Carter Family left to perform at radio stations, so she was brought along. When she was 4, she made her radio debut with a singsong child's rhyme. The performance was such a success that soon she and her sisters were regularly singing with the Carter Family on the Texas station XERA, a powerful radio broadcast set up mainly so that a quack doctor could advertise his unusual remedies for impotence.         When the Carter Family split up in 1943, Maybelle and her three daughters -- June, Helen and Anita -- formed Mother Maybelle and the Carter Singers, performing such Carter Family standards as ''Wildwood Flower,'' ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' and ''Keep on the Sunny Side.''         In the late 40's, Chet Atkins played guitar with them before establishing himself in Nashville. In the 50's and early 60's, the group joined the Grand Ole Opry and performed on bills with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, recording the hit ''Busted'' with Mr. Cash. Presley was said to have had an unrequited crush on Anita.         An accomplished stand-up bassist with a beautiful soprano voice, Anita Carter also appeared on television shows like ''The Kate Smith Evening Hour,'' where she could be seen singing with (and being wooed by) Hank Williams in one of the legendary country singer's few television appearances. Her sister June married Mr. Cash in 1968 after the family helped bring him back to stability after a period of drug abuse.         Anita Carter's first significant solo work was the 1951 single ''Bluebird,'' a duet with Hank Snow that topped the country charts along with its B-side, ''Down the Trail of Achin' Hearts.'' She also sang with another group on the side, a trio called 'Nita, Rita and Ruby. In the 60's, she recorded a hit duet with Waylon Jennings, ''I Got on You,'' and recorded singles and albums for the labels RCA, United Artists and, in the 70's, Capitol. She also appeared on records by Merle Haggard, Porter Wagoner and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.         Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, who renamed themselves the Carter Family after A. P. died in 1960, broke up officially in 1969, though they continued to record together until near the time of Maybelle's death in 1978. Anita's sister Helen died last summer, and June recently released an intimate, homemade solo album, ''Press On.''         In addition to June Carter Cash, of Hendersonville, Tenn., Ms. Carter is survived by a daughter, Lorrie Bennett, and a son, Jay, both of Goodlettsville.       
         Kim Perrot, the tiny floor leader of the Houston Comets team that has won the first two Women's National Basketball Association championships, died here today. She was 32.         She died at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center after a public battle against lung cancer. She recently had been seeking alternative treatment in Mexico after undergoing surgery on Feb. 24 to remove tumors in her brain, where the cancer had spread.         ''Who would have thought Kim Perrot would be a two-time W.N.B.A. champion?'' she said when she accepted her second championship ring during a Comets home game on June 22. ''When no one else believed in me, my teammates and the fans stuck with me.''         Perrot, who was 5 feet 5 inches and 130 pounds, was indeed an unlikely professional champion despite a record-setting college career. She held 26 school records at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, where she remains the career scoring leader with 2,157 points. As a senior, she led the nation in scoring, averaging 30.1 points a game.         After graduation, she did what other American female basketball players had to do at the time: she went abroad to play professionally, spending one year each in Sweden, Germany, Israel and France.         But the success of college women's basketball, coupled with the Olympic championship team at the 1996 Atlanta Games, put women's basketball on the American sports map. Perrot returned to the United States and attended a tryout with the Houston Comets, who signed her as a developmental player. By the end of the W.N.B.A.'s first season, Perrot was in charge of the league's best team. In her two-year career she averaged 4 assists, 7.2 points, 2.6 steals and 2.9 rebounds a game.         Perrot is survived by her mother, Consuella Perrot, two brothers, Craig Perrot and Kevin Perrot, and a sister, Loretta Williams.       
         Shulamit Katznelson, who was awarded the 1986 Israel Prize for Life Achievement, her country's highest honor, for bringing Arabs and Jews together through learning each other's languages, died yesterday at her home in the coastal town of Netanya, north of Tel Aviv. She was 80.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         For nearly half a century, Ms. Katznelson taught Hebrew to Arabs and Arabic to Jews at Ulpan Akiva, an independent residential language school she founded in Netanya in 1951. Arabs and Jews often room together at the school to help break down psychological barriers.         ''We are perhaps naive in trying to approach the problems of the region in this way,'' she said recently. ''But we believe that the firm foundations necessary to build and consolidate peace can only come about through person-to-person contacts and the ability of each side to speak the other's language.''         She added that many of the Jews and Arabs who attend the intensive six-week live-in course in a former hotel complex became friends and remained in touch with each other.         The school philosophy includes Ms. Katznelson's conviction that language cannot be separated from culture. Of the five hours of lessons each day in Hebrew, one hour is spent learning about Judaism and Jewish history. Likewise, the course in Arabic includes the study of Islam and Arab history as well as visits to Arab villages.         Ms. Katznelson was born in Geneva in 1919, and her family immigrated to Palestine two years later. Her mother, Bat-Sheva, became a legislator in Israel's Parliament. Her brother, Shmuel Tamir, served as Justice Minister, and an uncle, Zalman Shazar, was Israel's third President.         Ms. Katznelson attended high school and a teacher's college in Jerusalem, then attended a master's program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.         From the start, the program at Ulpan Akiva taught not only Jewish immigrants, but also Israel's Arab citizens and visitors from around the world.         Nearly 100,000 people from 148 countries have studied at the school in the last five decades, among them ambassadors, Israeli Army officers and Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ulpan Akiva set up two branch offices in the Gaza Strip towns of Gaza City and Khan Yunis.         Ms. Katznelson retired two years ago, and was succeeded at the school by Ephraim Lapid, a former Israeli brigadier general.       
         Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance and flair, died today in Munster, Germany. She was 67.         The cause was leukemia, aides to Mr. Gorbachev said. She had been under treatment in University Hospital in Munster since late July.         Mr. Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who, both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come. She emerged as a First Lady who had her own mind, her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.         None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was -- as it had always been -- at home, or at least in the background.         But since the beginning of this month, when Russians first learned that their former First Lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press, and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in Munster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many Russian hearts. ''It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,'' said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early 1990's, sent a message of condolence today, and in a statement he said that a ''wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother is no longer with us.''         In his autobiography, published in 1996, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ''Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one as saying. ''The simplest answer would have been: 'No, she is my wife.' ''         She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on her wardrobe -- in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives. On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes ''elegant, but not chic.''         On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, ''Who does that dame think she is?''         As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet First Lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie.         Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school with a gold medal -- top honors in the Soviet system -- and went on to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying philosophy there when she met Mr. Gorbachev, then a law student. According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.         ''Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote. ''She seemed calm and indifferent -- judging by the look in her eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Mr. Gorbachev's roommates for Raisa and her friends, ''I wanted to impress her,'' he wrote, but ''I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''         After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter, Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Mr. Gorbachev and two granddaughters.         After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the family returned to Mr. Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation, entitled ''The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.         When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.         As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's cultural heritage.         In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for more ''glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.         Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August 1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Mr. Gorbachev and his family returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ''Raisa Maksimovna took it very hard,'' said Mr. Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to Moscow.         In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences, entitled in English, ''I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said, ''the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws in the Soviet system.         In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa Maksimovna Club.         Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev changed as she got to know her better. ''She set herself very high goals -- she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen. ''Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to First Lady was a big jump.         ''She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a revolution, but she had many complexes, too -- a natural reserve and a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''         Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never bitter. ''She realized that people had been used to different women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen. ''She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her be mean or bitter about it.''         As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and literature, theater and politics. Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious discussions in the garden of their Government-provided apartment, beyond the earshot of K.G.B. eavesdropping devices.         Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided: ''I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you prefer, we have great complicity.''         After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin took over Mr. Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms that led to a decade of political and economic instability.         After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible until her recent illness.         With a diagnosis of acute lukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to the hospital in Munster on July 25. News of her hospitalization became public only in early August.         According to Russian news reports, Mr. Gorbachev remained at her side day and night. ''Dear God,'' the former Soviet President, visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9, ''for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very eyes.''       
         Mignon Garland, a dancer and teacher who played a major role in keeping Isadora Duncan's legacy alive in the United States, died on Sept. 15 at her home in San Pablo, Calif. She was 91.         After Duncan's death in 1927, her repertory and ideas as a pioneer of modern dance were passed directly to Ms. Garland and other disciples by the pupils Duncan had trained in Germany and called her adopted daughters. Two of them, Anna Duncan and Irma Duncan, were Ms. Garland's teachers in New York.         She, in turn, taught many of the fourth- and fifth-generation Duncan dancers performing today, including her granddaughter, Amy Baird Garlin, and Lori Belilove, well known for her concerts in New York.         As founder and director of the Isadora Duncan Heritage Society, Miss Garland was often consulted by scholars and performers.         Miss Garland, born in Brooklyn, studied ballet and other forms of dance as a child and was 13 when she performed at Town Hall. After seeing a performance by Anna Duncan in 1927, she decided to devote her life to Duncan dancing.         In 1930, she toured internationally with the Minneapolis Symphony as a member of Irma Duncan's company. After a United States tour, the pupils of the Russian school founded by Duncan invited Ms. Garland to study and dance with them in Moscow in 1931.         After her return in 1933, Miss Garland helped found the New Duncan Dancers and was dance editor of New Theater magazine. In 1942 she formed the Contemporary Duncan Dancers with two other prominent Duncan disciples, Hortense Kooluris and Julia Levien. The group performed at Carnegie Hall in 1944 with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leon Barzin. In 1952 the original members of Irma Duncan Dancers marked the 25th anniversary of Duncan's death with a concert at Carnegie Recital Hall.         Interest in Isadora Duncan's legend remained alive, but performances of her works became infrequent after the 1950's until Miss Garland helped promote the current Duncan revival that began with the 1977 centenary of the dance pioneer's birth.         After moving to Berkeley, Calif., in 1957, Miss Garland lived for many years in San Francisco at 501 Taylor Street, the site of Duncan's birth, which Miss Garland marked with a bronze plaque in 1973 at a ceremony attended by Irma Duncan.         In 1977, Mayor George Moscone proclaimed May 26 as Isadora Duncan Centenary Day, and Miss Garland's company, the San Francisco Duncan Dancers, performed in Colonial Concert Hall. In 1988 Miss Garland succeeded in having a street renamed Isadora Duncan Lane.         Miss Garland was also trained as an elementary school teacher at the Maxwell Training School in Brooklyn and like her parents, she was active in social and political causes. Her mother, Rose Heiman Halpern, helped Margaret Sanger open a birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916; her father, William Halpern, was defeated as a candidate for the New York State Assembly. Ms. Garland was denied a permanent teaching license in New York City. According to her son, Victor Garlin, the reason was ''her political organizing for improved schools in Harlem.''         After moving to California, Miss Garland taught Duncan's dancing under the auspices of the San Francisco Art Commission Neighborhood Arts Program and in private schools. She opened her own studio in 1973 and gave her last major recital with her students in 1989.         In addition to her son, of Berkeley, she is survived by a sister, Paula H. Gould of New York, and two granddaughters.       
         Diane Erickson, a model who was on the cover of Self magazine's first issue in 1979 and who later became a fashion photographer, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She was 43.         She died from complications from breast cancer, said Meg D'Incecco, the public relations director of Self, a health and fitness magazine for women.         Ms. Erickson acted in several films, including ''Jagged Edge'' and ''Runaway Train.'' After her cancer was diagnosed last year, Ms. Erickson wrote a monthly chronicle of her fight against cancer called ''Diane's Diary'' for Self.         She also began to create a visual and literary record of her life and was preparing it as a book with a friend.         Mason Flaine, chairman of C.R.C. Press, a specialized publishing house, said he planned to publish the book when the friend completed it.         Born on May 24, 1956, in the Boston area, Ms. Erickson studied photography at the State University of New York at Buffalo and later worked with well-known fashion photographers.         She was legally separated from her husband, Michael Charles. She is survived by her daughter, Helena, of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Helfer of Centerville, Tex.; two brothers, John Erickson of Cleveland and Thomas Erickson of Houston, and two sisters, Christina Reid of Sugarland, Tex., and Jane Ashmore of Texas.       
         Katie Webster, the blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer known as the Swamp Boogie Queen, a mainstay of Gulf Coast rhythm-and-blues recordings in the 1950's and 60's and a popular touring artist in the 80's and early 90's, died on Sunday at her home in League City, Tex. She was 63.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter Elizabeth Vereen.         Ms. Webster, born Kathryn Jewel Thorne, was reared by musicians: her father was a ragtime pianist who turned to gospel music when he became a minister in the Sanctified Church of God in Christ, in Houston, and her mother, who played spirituals and classical music, was responsible for her keyboard training.         She began her professional musical life early, although it was not the sort her parents would have encouraged: at 13 she was traveling the ''crawfish circuit'' from Dallas to New Orleans with a jazz band. At 15 she married the pianist Earl Webster, and around that time the guitarist and singer Ashton Savoy tookMs. Webster to south Louisiana to make a recording with him.         This was the beginning of a studio career that would encompass hundreds of records on Louisiana labels including Goldband and Excello. She recorded with many of the area's best-known regional musicians, including Slim Harpo, Lightnin' Slim, Clifton Chenier and Guitar Junior. She played on the original version of ''Sea of Love,'' by Phil Phillips.         In 1964 Otis Redding played at the Bamboo Club, the Lake Charles bar where Ms. Webster's band the Uptighters often played. Redding was so taken by the heavy and exact timekeeping of her left hand that he hired her immediately; for the next three years she was both his opening act and the pianist in his band. (She played on such well-known Redding albums as ''Live at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go.'')         She was pregnant and on leave from the band in 1967 when Mr. Redding undertook his final tour and died in a plane crash.         Ms. Webster did not restart her career until 1982, when she toured Europe for the first time; her hollering voice and her charismatic innuendo-laden performances won her fans, and her second act had begun. She performed in the San Francisco Bay Area and around Europe through the 1980's and recorded for the Arhoolie and Alligator labels, with Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray showing their support in guest appearances.         A stroke in 1993 damaged her playing and her eyesight, although she continued to perform sporadically.         In addition to Ms. Vereen, of League City, she is survived by another daughter, Audrey Johnson of Houston; two sisters, Earline Allen of Houston and Irma Dews of San Pablo, Calif.; three brothers, Cyrus, Robert and Cornelius Thorne, all of San Francisco; eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Roman, a screen actress who parlayed her electrically charged combination of sexiness and wholesomeness into Hollywood stardom in the late 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at her home in Laguna Beach, Calif. She was 75.         She died in her sleep, said her son, Richard Hall.         After her breakout role opposite Kirk Douglas in Stanley Kramer's ''Champion,'' a 1949 adaptation of a Ring Lardner short story about a maniacal prize fighter, Warner Brothers gave her starring roles in nine films in under two years.         In one day she leaped from working with Bette Davis in ''Beyond the Forest'' to supporting Milton Berle in ''Always Leave Them Laughing.'' A week after the completion of ''Strangers on a Train'' opposite Robert Walker, she was whisked into ''Tomorrow Is Another Day'' with Steve Cochran.         From 1948 to 1965, Ms. Roman appeared in more than 30 movies, and in the 1960's and 70's in numerous television shows.         Her romantic partners in films included Randolph Scott in ''Colt .45,'' James Stewart in ''The Far Country'' and Gary Cooper in ''Dallas.''         Few of her films are studied in film schools today. But in their time they made box office cash registers ring like sleigh bells and in 1951 Ms. Roman was receiving 500 letters a week from around the world.         There were plenty of cheesecake queens in Hollywood seeking roles when Ms. Roman arrived in 1945, but it was her come-hitcher warmth, combined with her shapely, dark-haired good looks, that made her a standout. When Collier's profiled her in 1951, the magazine declared that Ms. Roman's career had been built on a ''pervasive air of wholesomeness.''         It was an appeal that even Ms. Roman did not fully understand. When she auditioned for a part in ''Champion,'' she thought she would be right for the role of the fighter's gold-digging floozy and accordingly wore a tight-fitting black dress and heavy makeup when she swivel-hipped into Stanley Kramer's office.         But somehow the wholesomeness showed through. ''Actually, I thought of you for the other girl,'' said Mr. Kramer, then serving as the film's producer.         Marilyn Maxwell played the floozy, with Kirk Douglas as the fighter and Ms. Roman as his demure and steadfast wife.         It had been that same quality that landed Ms. Roman her first film role: a bit part as a WAVE in ''Stage Door Canteen'' in 1942.         Clem Beauchamp, company manager for ''Stage Door Canteen,'' told an interviewer in 1951 that he chose Ms. Roman from dozens of eager actresses because ''I felt right away that here was a girl who would show up on time in the morning with her lines learned and no nonsense.''         By Hollywood standards, Ms. Roman's romantic life was a bit dull. She dated Bill Walsh, a publicity agent, for five years. She once stepped out with Ronald Reagan. And in 1950 she married Mortimer Hall, a Los Angeles television executive. The marriage ended in divorce.  A second marriage, to Budd Burton Moss, also ended in divorce. She told interviewers that she disliked nightclubs and flashy clothes. Her one extravagance, she said, was her collection of 35 pairs of shoes, and that consisted mainly of Indian moccasins.         Not all of the excitement in her life was make-believe. In 1956 Ms. Roman was aboard the luxury passenger liner Andrea Doria when it was struck by the Stockholm. Ms. Roman was returning from Italy with her 3-year-old son, Dickie. She was dancing in the ship's Belvedere room, she told a reporter for The New York Times, when ''we heard a big explosion like a firecracker.''         She said she saw smoke coming from the general area of her cabin and rushed there to protect her son. He was sound asleep. She said she awakened Dickie and told him,  ''We're going on a picnic.''         When it was clear that the liner was sinking and passengers began entering lifeboats, a seaman lowered Dickie into a boat. Ms. Roman said she followed down a rope ladder, but when she was halfway down the lifeboat pulled away. She called out to the boat but it did not return. She was put on another lifeboat.         Ms. Roman told a reporter she was never in fear for her son's life, but felt sure he would be safe in the lifeboat, which turned out to be true. Ms. Roman and her son were among the 760 survivors of the Andrea Doria.         Her son, her only survivor, lives in California.         Born in Lynn, Mass., on Dec. 23, 1923, she was the youngest of three daughters of immigrants from Lithuania. Her father, Anthony Roman, a carnival barker, died when she was a child, forcing her mother to work as a waitress, cleaning woman and laundress.         Ms. Roman was proud of her family's endurance. ''For a while,'' she once told a reporter, ''we were moving regularly once a month because we couldn't pay our rent.''         But she never felt sorry for herself, she said, remarking, ''When you start out poor, you don't know what you're missing.''         Ms. Roman quit high school in her second year when she decided to become an actress. During the day she worked as a movie usher and at night she performed with the New England Repertory Company, a semi-professional group in Boston.         With $200 in her pocketbook, she  soon struck out for Hollywood. For a while, she lived in a boarding house with several other aspiring actresses. They called their home the House of the Seven Garbos.         For six years she endured a series of disappointments. She got a good part in a western called ''White Stallion,'' but it was never released. Then came a role in ''A Night in Casablanca,'' but after the filming her part was cut. But then everything changed after her audition with Stanley Kramer.       
         Birgit Cullberg, a pioneering experimental choreographer in Sweden who earned an international reputation through her intense dramatic ballets and vigorous social-protest pieces, died on Wednesday in Stockholm, where she lived. She was 91.         Although Miss Cullberg was a disciple of the German Expressionist choreographer Kurt Jooss, her own style fused modern dance and ballet. She was resident choreographer of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1951 to 1957, and her most famous works were danced by ballet companies throughout the world.         Among these was her acknowledged masterpiece, ''Miss Julie,'' based on the August Strindberg play; it had its premiere in Sweden in 1950. Restaged to great acclaim in 1958 for American Ballet Theater, ''Miss Julie'' was a triumph for Violette Verdy in the title role, as the Swedish aristocrat who seduces a butler, and for Erik Bruhn as Jean, the butler. Mr. Bruhn virtually made the role his own for 20 years through his astonishingly powerful portrayal.         Ballet Theater staged three other Cullberg works, including the haunting Lapp tale ''Moon Reindeer.'' In 1958 the New York City Ballet presented Miss Cullberg's ''Medea'' with Melissa Hayden in the title role. In his review, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''There is not a superfluous phrase, a meaningless gesture, an item of mere decoration in the choreography from end to end.''         Psychological insight was Miss Cullberg's strength, as she showed again in 1982 when the Cullberg Ballet, which she founded in 1967, made its belated United States debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with  Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in attendance.         Never shy about exploring the neurotic and the erotic, Miss Cullberg was represented by a duet, ''Adam and Eve,'' and an especially sensuous performance of ''Miss Julie,'' which nonetheless focused on the class differences between Julie and her servant. In ''Adam and Eve,'' Daniela Malusardi and Niklas Ek, Miss Cullberg's elder son, moved seamlessly from innocent playfulness to adult passion, a couple expelled from Eden but rejecting God as well.         Most of the other choreography was by Mats Ek, Miss Cullberg's other son, who cast her as a Mother Africa figure in his ''Soweto.'' Miss Cullberg, then 74, came out swinging, kicking, fiery-eyed and goading the oppressed onstage to resist until they collapsed to the sound of gunshots. In 1991, with her long white hair still flying, Miss Cullberg performed in Mats Ek's television dance production ''The Old Woman and the Door.''         She excelled in choreography for television. Her duet ''Red Wine in Green Glasses'' (1970) was shown on public television in the United States and was awarded the Prix Italia.         Miss Cullberg started life in a secure, wealthy home, but she had a volatile relationship with Anders Ek, one of Sweden's leading actors, whom she married in 1942. They had three children: Niklas, a brilliant dancer; Mats, 54, and his twin, the actress Malin Ek. They survive her, as do several grandchildren.         Miss Cullberg and her husband separated in 1949, and ''Medea,'' like many of her works, was interpreted by several Swedish critics as a piece that universalized her private emotions of the time.         Miss Cullberg and her husband reconciled in 1959 and both joined the new Stockholm City Theater, she as a stage director. (She directed him in ''Othello.'') The couple eventually divorced, but in the late 1970's, after Mr. Ek's death, Miss Cullberg choreographed a meditation on their life entitled ''Dreams of Love and Death.''         Born in Nykoping, Sweden, on Aug. 3, 1908, Miss Cullberg was the daughter of Ella W. Cullberg and Carl Cullberg, a bank director, and attended the University of Stockholm. After Jooss, the choreographer of the celebrated antiwar ballet ''The Green Table,'' appeared with his company in Stockholm, Miss Cullberg spent four years in England studying with him at Dartington Hall, an experimental arts center.         Returning to Sweden in 1939, she formed a small company and danced solos inspired by animal movements. In the early 1940's she studied ballet and wrote dance criticism. In 1946 she and the choreographer Ivo Cramer formed the Swedish Dance Theater, which disbanded in 1948. As the Royal Swedish Ballet's resident choreographer, she staged eight ballets.         In 1967 the Swedish Government established the current Cullberg Ballet. Writing in 1982 the Swedish critic Erik Naslund paid tribute to Miss Cullberg by declaring that it was her troupe, not the Royal Swedish Ballet, that was ''definitely the more prestigious company.''       
         Doreen Valiente, a self-proclaimed witch who in the mid-1950's wrote part of the liturgy now used by witches around the world, died in Brighton, England, on Sept. 1. She was 77.         Through lectures and her many books, Ms. Valiente became the chief proselytizer of the white witch movement, which espouses use of magic, defined as Divine energy, for beneficial purposes.         She was held by many to be the ''mother of modern paganism,'' according to The Times of London, which reported her death on Monday. As a coven of today's witches gather in a circle, it is her version of the Charge of the Goddess, a witches' liturgical text, that the priestess recites.         ''Over the course of her life she witnessed -- and helped generate -- a sustained revival of witchcraft and paganism in Britain, despite repeated protestations by evangelical Christians,'' The Times said in its obituary.         Phyllis W. Curott, president emeritus of Covenant of the Goddess, a New York-based umbrella organization for witches, said that in recent years millions of people had been drawn to witchcraft, but that the words written by Ms. Valiente remain central in virtually every ceremony.         ''A common chord, uniting all, is a real love and appreciation for the Charge of the Goddess,'' she said.         For Ms. Valiente, witchcraft became ever more inclusive, ultimately embracing feminism, environmentalism and a host of New Age concepts, including native American spirituality.         ''It was an idea whose time had come,'' Ms. Valiente said in a 1991 interview, ''and these other things are also things whose time has come.''         Ms. Valiente became a guiding force in the wicca movement, which derives its name from an old Anglo-Saxon word for witch, or the wise one.         In the United States, Ms. Curott said, the number of wicca devotees now numbers three million to five million, making it one of the country's fastest growing beliefs.         Ms. Valiente was born Doreen Dominy in London in 1922. She was brought up as a Christian and sent to a convent school, which she walked out of at 15, refusing to return.         Biographers say that she experienced psychic episodes in her youth, and that by her late teens she was a practicing clairvoyant. She worked as a secretary by day.         In 1944, she married Casimiro Valiente, a refugee from the Spanish Civil War who went on to fight with the Free French.         In 1952, shortly after Britain had repealed its Witchcraft Act, which had outlawed witchery, she approached Cecil Williamson, then owner of the Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man.         Mr. Williamson put her in touch with Gerald Gardner, who headed a group of witches called the New Forest Coven. Mr. Gardner initiated her as a witch in 1953. Ms. Valiente became the coven's high priestess and collaborated with Mr. Gardner in putting an up-to-date spin on what was billed as the witches' ancient liturgy, ''Book of Shadows,'' written in segments during the 1950's         The book was actually an eclectic mix, based principally on Charles Leland's ''Gospel of the Witches,'' published in 1899, but drawing also on Freemasonry, theosophy and the works of the Golden Dawn, a magical tradition of England and Ireland embraced by George Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats.         Wicca began to be practiced with its new ritual and with Ms. Valiente in a prominent position. ''She became a high priestess during an era when witchcraft was still very much in the broom closet,'' Ms. Currot said.         She was tapping into a rich and quixotic tradition. Witchcraft had persisted and sometimes been tolerated, despite laws against it going back to the seventh century.         ''The story of witchcraft in Britain is unique, in both its form and mildness, when compared with the rest of Europe,'' wrote Ronald Holmes in his book, ''Witchcraft in British History'' in 1974.         Ms. Valiente broke with Mr. Gardner in 1957 when he ignored the coven's vows of secrecy by aggressively seeking publicity. After the deaths of her mother in 1964 and husband in 1972 (neither of whom had approved of her career choice) she began to take a much more personal and active role in what witches simply call the craft.         Her most important contribution to the movement was a stream of books, including ''An A B C of Witchcraft,'' published in 1973; ''Witchcraft for Tomorrow'' (1978), and ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft,'' (1989).         A gauge of the growth of her movement is that 1964, when she gave the opening speech at the inaugural dinner at the Witchcraft Research Association, it was attended by 50 subscribers. In November 1977, she addressed an audience of 1,500 at the Pagan Federation Congress.         Ron Cooke, a fellow believer who was her companion for most of the last two decades of her life, died in 1997. She left no close relatives, but made the Center for Pagan Studies in Surrey, England, principal beneficiary.         ''She was a wise and wild woman, who definitely ran with the British equivalent of wolves,'' said Ms. Curott, who in 1985 won the case allowing witch clergy to perform weddings in New York City.       
         Nathalie Sarraute, the Russian-born French novelist who remained an influential and innovative literary figure long after she first gained fame as the doyenne of the Nouveau Roman movement in the late 1950's, died today at her home in Paris. She was 99 and also had a country home in Cherence in Normandy.         In a writing career that lasted more than six decades, Mrs. Sarraute published 17 books, including 10 novels, although in her very first book, ''Tropisms,'' she already set the tone of her life's work. She took the book's title from the biological term for the involuntary reaction of plants to external stimuli and used it to describe the human impulses that precede gestures or words.         All her subsequent books can be understood through the prism of these tropisms, which she once described as ''the interior movements that prepare our words and actions at the limits of our consciousness.'' On another occasion, she spoke of her writing as ''sub-conversation'' through which she captured and conveyed half-formed ideas and feelings in often hesitant dialogue.         While ''tropisms'' became her tool for exploring the human spirit, her purpose was to break with the 19th-century novel of Balzac and Flaubert, which in her view, had been made obsolete by Kafka, Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. She considered these writers to be her mentors, but she went further, creating a stark literary form stripped of characters, plot and chronology, a form that Jean-Paul Sartre tagged the ''antinovel.''         ''I believe that, through my novels, I showed that it was possible to write novels where the purely fictional element was freed from the conventions that encumbered it, just as the purely pictorial element in painting has freed itself from subject matter, perspective, and so on,'' Mrs. Sarraute wrote in an essay in The New York Times Book Review in 1964.         In the 1950's, her innovative approach drew her toward several young French writers, among them Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Marguerite Duras, Claude Simon, and Robert Pinget, who came to be identified with the Nouveau Roman (a term borrowed from a critic for Le Monde). But while she enjoyed being discovered as a ''new novelist'' when she was already well into her 50's, her attacks on traditional literary form both anticipated and survived the movement.         Born into an intellectual Jewish family in Ivanovo, Russia, on July 18, 1900, Natasha Tcherniak -- as she then was -- had an unsettling childhood. Her father, Elie, a chemist, and her mother, Pauline, a writer, separated when she was 2 and remarried,  and she was painfully shuttled back and forth between two countries and two sets of parents. She went to Paris with her mother in 1902, moved to St. Petersburg in 1905 and then returned to Paris in 1908, where she was then brought up by her father and his new wife, Vera.         Soon fluent in German and English as well as French and Russian, she  studied law and literature at the Sorbonne and Oxford University before joining a Paris law firm in 1925, the same year that she married a fellow lawyer, Raymond Sarraute. After Germany occupied France in 1940, she escaped the fate of 76,000 Jews who were deported from France to German death camps by hiding out in a village and posing as Nicole Sauvage, the governess of her own three young daughters.         She never returned to the Paris bar. In 1932, she had begun writing ''Tropisms,'' a book comprising 24 short sketches. She finished five years later, but it was not until 1939 that she found a publisher. After the war, dedicating herself entirely to writing, she became friends with Sartre, who offered to write a preface for her first novel, ''Portrait of a  Man Unknown'' (1948), which he famously described as ''an antinovel that reads like a detective story.'' He noted, ''Nathalie Sarraute has a horror of the tricks of the novelist.''         Although Mrs. Sarraute was not drawn to existentialism, she remained friends with Sartre until Simone de Beauvoir came between them. ''She separated us completely,'' Mrs. Sarraute recalled in a 1990 interview with The Paris Review. ''But I heard that she couldn't bear Sartre having an intellectual relationship with anyone, male or female.''         Like many French writers then and now, Mrs. Sarraute liked to work at a table in a cafe, in her case one at the Trocadero near her home in the 16th arrondissement. In his memoir ''Paris in the Fifties,'' the American journalist and author Stanley Karnow, who was briefly married to Mrs. Sarraute's eldest daughter, Claude, paints a portrait of the writer as ''a lean, severe-looking woman with a hawk nose, piercing black eyes and combed-back ebony hair.''         At one point, Mr. Karnow recalled, he moved in with his wife's parents, although he was unsure whether Mrs. Sarraute's ''unpredictable Slavic temperament'' would prove too much. ''She could be uptight and relaxed, cantankerous and amiable, dour and cheerful,'' he wrote. ''Even so, I adored her -- or perhaps it was the intellectual electricity of her company.'' Mrs. Sarraute is survived by her daughter Claude and two other daughters, Anne and Dominique.         In her second novel, ''Martereau'' (1953), Mrs. Sarraute used the natural intrigue of an extended family to explore her tropisms. The book sold few copies, but it sufficed to identify her as a ''new novelist.'' Just three years later, when she published ''The Age of Suspicion,'' this book of essays about her approach to literature was presented to the public as ''the first theoretical manifestation of the Nouveau Roman school.''         Mrs. Sarraute was not prolific. After she published ''The Planetarium'' in 1959, it would take more than a decade for her to complete her next three novels -- ''The Golden Fruits'' (1963), ''Between Life and Death'' (1968) and ''Do You Hear Them?'' (1972) -- which had in common a complex and humorous self-criticism of her own creative process hidden inside a novel.         Quintessentially French in its intellectual playfulness, ''The Golden Fruits'' revolved around a discussion of the merits and demerits of an imaginary, much-acclaimed book, also called ''The Golden Fruits,'' a discussion that enabled Mrs. Sarraute to demystify the solemn language of literary criticism through parody and caricature while, at the same time, raising disturbing questions. ''It is my most abstract work,'' she said at the time.         Well received in France, ''The Golden Fruits'' appeared obscure to some American critics. ''The fact that this misty book contains some valid satirical points does not make it a rewarding novel,'' Orville Prescott wrote in The New York Times in February 1964. ''When the experimental techniques shrink the size of fiction and squeeze the juices of life out of it, they are fruitless indeed.''         Albeit eliminating even the narrator from some of her books (in which characters may be reduced to ''he,'' ''she'' and ''they''), Mrs. Sarraute was in fact always present as a form of mischievous puppeteer. In her 1983 autobiographical work, ''Childhood,'' however, she showed herself, at least how she remembered her turbulent first 12 years of life. And, typically, she recalled them through the impact of single words, like ''stupid'' and ''tragedy.''         ''Childhood'' was written in her ''predialogue'' style, which she defined as the ''little bits of something still alive'' on the border of consciousness, ''something prior to language -- a sensation, a perception.'' These feelings, she said, must be captured before they're labeled with adult words because adult words both falsify experience and render it traumatizing.         ''Childhood'' was adapted as a one-act play and presented in New York with Glenn Close. But it was less successful than several pieces that she wrote as radio plays and that were later staged, among them ''The Lie'' and ''Silence.'' In writing for theater, she was also forced to become more explicit. In novels, she said, the dialogue skimmed the surface of the sub-conversation. But in plays, the ''predialogue'' became a fully fledged dialogue. ''They later said my plays, in relation to my novels, were like a glove turned inside out,'' she told The Paris Review.         Slowing down in the mid-1980's after the death of her husband, Mrs. Sarraute nonetheless never stopped writing, occasionally demonstrating that she remained as fascinated with her explorations of language as she had been a half-century or more earlier. ''You Don't Love Yourself,'' published in 1990, is a dialogue about self-hate in which, as often is the case, there is a counterpoint between language and emotion.         ''Here,'' published in 1995 in France and in 1997 in the United States, just as Mrs. Sarraute's complete works were being reissued in France's legendary Pleiade Series, is as always a novel without plot or characters or perhaps, as suggested by Richard Burgin writing in The Washington Post, ''a poetic essay of ideas'' in which the author pursues ''the power and poverty of words.''         In France, ''Here'' was described by some critics as Mrs. Sarraute's final testimony, an apt summation of her oeuvre. But she had not yet finished. In September 1997, at the age of 97, she published ''Ouvrez,'' or ''Open,'' a 130-page book in which she denounced the impoverishment of the French language. ''It seems completely mad,'' she remarked in one interview, ''but at my age one is allowed to write things that are completely mad.'' And, unsurprisingly, she was working on yet another book at the time of her death.       
         Penelope Mortimer, an English author who drew on her complex and often turbulent relationships with men in writing novels like ''The Pumpkin Eater'' and a heatedly debated account of the romantic life of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, died on Tuesday at a London hospice. She was 81 and lived in Willesden, a suburb in north London.         Her dozen novels focus on the upper middle class in Britain. ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1962), which dealt with a troubled marriage, was made into a successful film in 1964 starring James Mason and Anne Bancroft.         Her novel ''My Friend Says It's Bulletproof'' (1968) is loosely based on an affair she had with a lawyer on a trip to Canada. ''Long Distance'' (1974), which tells Kafka-esque story of a woman confined to a bizarre institution, was one of the few novels to be published in its entirety in The New Yorker.         Ms. Mortimer also wrote two highly praised volumes of memoirs and several television screenplays, including her adaptation of ''Portrait of a Marriage,'' the 1973 biography of Vita Sackville-West and her husband, Harold Nicolson, by Nigel Nicolson, their son.         Shown in the United States in 1992 as a three-part series on ''Masterpiece Theater'' on PBS, the programs were upsetting to many viewers because of their portrayal of homosexual liaisons and lesbian love scenes.         Ms. Mortimer was well known if not always beloved in Britain for her biography ''Queen Elizabeth: A Life of the Queen Mother'' (1986), which delved into the subject's romantic life before her marriage to the future King George VI.         Ms. Mortimer, the former Penelope Ruth Fletcher, was born in Oxfordshire, the daughter of a vicar who periodically professed to have lost his faith in God. When she was 16, she attended the Central Educational Bureau for Women in London  to learn secretarial skills.         In 1937 she married Charles Dimont, a Reuters correspondent with whom she lived in Vienna and observed the German annexation of Austria. Divorced in 1949, she married John Mortimer, the author, the same year.         She is survived by a son, Jeremy Mortimer of London; five daughters, Madelon Dimont Burk of France, Caroline Bennett of London, Julia Mankowitz of London, Deborah Rogers of Cornwall, England, and Sally Silverman of Bristol, England, and 11 grandchildren.         In the 1950's and 60's the couple were frequently photographed at London society events and, The London Daily Telegraph's obituary said, they ''seemed to represent the last word in marital chic.'' Behind this facade, however, Ms. Mortimer had  frequent bouts of depression. The marriage ended in divorce in 1972.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Marilyn Silverstone, who left a career as a top photographer for the simple life of a Buddhist nun with the name Ngawang Chodron, died of cancer in a monastery near Katmandu last Tuesday, her sister Susan Darer said. She was 70.         She founded a nunnery several years ago near Katmandu, Nepal, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist nunneries outside of Tibet. It was a major step toward recapturing women's traditionally strong role in Tibetan Buddhism, said Gene Smith, a Boston-based publisher of Buddhist books. Ms. Silverstone worked for the photo agency Magnum -- photographing subjects from Albert Schweitzer to the coronation of the Shah of Iran -- but her last years were spent establishing the nunnery.         ''She was very interested in helping other women,'' said Jean Thies, a Buddhist living in Manhattan who has a business importing Tibetan Buddhist goods into the United States. Ms. Thies and others said this was a response to a diminished religious role for women in the Buddhist communities in exile from Tibet. Mr. Smith said, ''Women had come to be regarded as just handmaidens to the clergy.''         Ms. Silverstone's personal transformation, from a stylish photographer in Dior suits to a nun with a shaved head and running shoes dyed purple to go with her maroon robes, struck friends and colleagues as remarkable. As for herself, she saw the personal journey to her ultimate Buddhist identity, Ngawang Chodron, as essentially inevitable.         ''The only way to make my inside match my outside was to become a nun,'' she wrote.         Ms. Silverstone was born on March 9, 1929, in London, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Wellesley College in 1950. Her father was a movie executive who worked with Charlie Chaplin and other early movie stars; her mother, late in life, decided to get an education and graduated from college at 80.         Ms. Silverstone's first jobs were with art and design magazines, including Art News. In 1955, she became a freelance photographer. She went to India on an assignment to photograph Ravi Shankar in 1956 and fell in love with Frank Moraes, then editor of The Indian Express. They lived together until 1974, socializing in an elite set of politicians, journalists and intellectuals.         Her reputation as a photographer grew, and in 1967 she became a full member of Magnum, which is organized as a photographer-owned cooperative. She covered such big events as the arrival of the Dalai Lama in India, but it was the insights into Indian life, particularly in the villages, that she most cherished.         One famous image showed an Indian princess sitting shyly in sunglasses surrounded by 265 tigers her husband had shot. Ms. Silverstone avoided ''poverty pictures,'' calling them an Indian cliche.         Increasingly, she came to see taking pictures as predatory, once suggesting that subjects become ''like pieces of meat.'' But she readily admitted that she herself would often choose the most abject case in a line of poor children to make her journalistic point. ''You find you are getting glib with your hands,'' she said.         So she was ready to complete a journey that had begun when, as a child suffering from the mumps, she picked up ''Secret Tibet'' by Fosco Maraini. She said the book provided a key she long carried in her subconscious, the mysticism of Tibet. Mr. Moraes died in 1974 and she became a nun in 1977.         In 1987, she was fully ordained in a ceremony in Hong Kong.         Friends say she exhibited a hearty sense of humor, one laced with American Jewish expressions. She wrote several books, including several children's books published in the 1960's. In 1985, she published ''Ocean of Life: Visions of India and Himalayan Kingdoms.'' Just before her death, she finished translating a book by an 18th-century female lama into English.         Besides Ms. Darer, she is survived by another sister, Barbara S. Garrison.         Starting on Nov. 5, the work of five Magnum photojournalists, including Ms. Silverstone, will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In a biography of her, one of the other photographers, Eva Arnold, quoted Ms. Silverstone summing up her life.         ''I can say that I did it all,'' Ms. Silverstone was quoted as saying. ''The secret though is just keep walking through life without analyzing it too much or clinging to it too much. Just walk on.''         Correction:  October 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the photographer and Buddhist nun Marilyn Silverstone on Monday misstated the given name of a photojournalist whose work, along with hers and others', will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh beginning Nov. 5. The photojournalist is Eve Arnold, not Eva.       
         Laura Adasko Lenzner, an artist who worked in pastel, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 50 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Allan Lenzner.         Ms. Lenzner, who went by Laura Adasko professionally, was born in Brooklyn and educated at the Art Students League in Manhattan and Mills College in Oakland, Calif. She began her career working in batik. With her business partner Alice Huberman, Ms. Lenzner created colorful fabrics in the early 1970's.         She later began working in pastels and her work has been shown at the Blue Mountain Gallery in SoHo, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton, N.Y.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sons, Benjamin, of Northfield, Minn., and Samuel and David, of New York; her mother, Mary Adasko, and a brother, Hardy Adasko, both of Brooklyn.       
         Monique Beudert, a museum curator who worked in New York and London, died last Saturday at her home in London. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Beudert was born on Long Island and studied art history at Connecticut College, earning a B.A. in 1972, and at Hunter College. In 1973 she joined the office of the registrar at the Museum of Modern Art and in 1976 became a curatorial assistant in the department of painting and sculpture. She worked on exhibitions like ''Late Cezanne,'' ''Joseph Cornell'' and ''An International Survey of Painting and Sculpture,'' the opening exhibition in the Modern's 1984 expansion.         In 1994 she joined the Tate Gallery in London as an associate curator. At the time of her death she was working on an exhibition of the work of  Barnett Newman, the American Abstract Expressionist, to be held in 2002 at the Tate Modern, the Tate's new museum that is to open in the  spring.         She is survived by her husband, Brian Boylan; her mother, Adele Beudert of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; her sisters, Martine, of Brooklyn and Michele Richard of Old Greenwich, Conn.; a brother, Claude, of East Hampton, N.Y., and two stepdaughters, Grace and Serena Boylan of London.       
         Ella Mae Morse, the sultry, swinging pop-jazz singer whose 1942 hit, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' became the first million seller for the fledgling Capitol Records and helped establish the label, died on Saturday at the Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead City. She was 75 and lived in Bullhead City.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her press agent, Alan Eichler.         A true original, Ms. Morse belted an exuberant mixture of boogie-woogie, blues, jazz, swing and country that transcended genres. Her 1946 recording of ''House of Blue Lights'' is considered influential in the evolution of rock-and-roll. Among her other hits were ''Shoo-Shoo Baby,'' ''Mister Five by Five,'' ''No Love, No  Nothin,' '' ''Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet,'' ''The Patty-Cake Man'' and her million-selling 1952 comeback hit, ''The Blacksmith Blues.''         Ms. Morse was born in 1924 in Mansfield, Tex. Her father, George Morse, a drummer from England, led a small dance band and her mother, Ann, a native Texan, played ragtime and Dixieland piano. By age 9, Ms. Morse was singing with her father's band in nightclubs. When the family moved to Paris, Tex., she befriended an elderly black guitar player who taught her the blues and became a major influence on her style.         At 13 (but claiming to be 19), Ms. Morse auditioned for Jimmy Dorsey's band in Dallas. She won the job, but had to quit when her charade was discovered. Moving to San Diego, she was reunited with Freddie Slack, Dorsey's pianist, who had quit the band to strike out on his own as a leader. He hired her to be his vocalist just as the band was signed by Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs to be the first artists on their new label, Capitol Records. Their first recording, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' was a novelty song.         After the song leaped to the top of the pop charts, Ms. Morse was signed to Capitol as a soloist and remained there for the next 15 years. Many of her hits were even more in the rhythm-and-blues than in the pop market, and many fans didn't know whether she was black or white. (She was white.) In 1946 she reunited with Slack to record the seminal ''House of Blue Lights.''         After taking several years off to start a family, Ms. Morse returned to Capitol studios in 1952 to record ''The Blacksmith Blues.'' Although she stopped recording in 1957, she continued to make occasional appearances, including a 1970's tour with Mr. Carter's band and an annual engagement at Disneyland with Ray McKinley's band. In 1984 she made a series of club appearances in Los Angeles, and in 1987 she appeared at Michael's Pub in New York. Two years ago her complete body of work was released in a five-CD box set by Bear Family Records.         She is survived by Jack Bradford, her husband, their children, Dan and Laura, and four children from previous marriages: Richard, Marcia, Ann and Kenny, as well as eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader who in 1957 led the fight to admit nine black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., died yesterday at a hospital there. She was 84.         In the integration struggle, rocks were thrown through her window, a burning cross was placed on her roof and the newspaper published by her and her husband, L. C. Bates, was ultimately destroyed financially. But she nurtured the nine black children who faced vicious insults and physical intimidation. She encouraged them to be courageous, while striving to guard them against howling white mobs.         The result was one of the early major victories in the civil rights movement. The desegregation of Central High School with the aid of federal troops signaled that Washington would enforce the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, which declared school segregation unconstitutional.         Mrs. Bates, as Arkansas president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was a central figure in the litigation that led to the confrontation in front of Central High, as well as the snarling scenes that unfolded in front of it.         The success of the Little Rock campaign, she later said, ''had a lot to do with removing fear that people have for getting involved.''         In her forward to Mrs. Bates's 1962 book, ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock,'' Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, ''I have paid her homage in my thoughts many times and I want to tell her again how remarkable I think she was through these horrible years.''         President Clinton yesterday called her a dear friend and a heroine and said her death ''will leave a vacuum in the civil rights community, the State of Arkansas and our country.''         Daisy Bates was born in the little sawmill town of Huttig in southern Arkansas, growing up in a shotgun shack, so called because one could stand at the front door and fire a shotgun straight through the back door into the yard. She attended segregated schools that used out-of-date textbooks passed on from white schools, according to the African-American Almanac.         In her book, she told of the trauma of learning at 8 that her mother had been killed in a rape attempt by three white men. After she had heard rumors, her father told her the truth in simple and straightforward terms. ''So happy once,'' she wrote, ''now I was like a little sapling which, after a violent storm, puts out only gnarled and twisted branches.''         When she was about 15, an insurance agent came to visit her home. He was L. C. Bates, who had studied journalism and then worked for newspapers in Colorado and Kansas City. Newspapers were a shaky calling in the Depression, and he had turned to selling insurance.         After a courtship, the two married and settled in Little Rock. Together, they started a newspaper called The Arkansas State Press. It reported extensively on racially motivated violence and became known as a strong exponent of civil rights. After being elected state N.A.A.C.P. president in 1952, and as a result of the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Mrs. Bates became a particularly forceful advocate of desegregation. She began by taking black children to white schools to be registered. If the school refused, as they always did, she would report it in her paper.         In Arkansas, local and state officials initially tried to delay school desegregation, ostensibly to make the process more orderly. This resulted in a suit by the N.A.A.C.P. to force the issue. At Central High, 75 black students initially registered, a number that was ultimately reduced to 9 chosen by school authorities. They were deemed the most emotionally mature.         But Gov. Orval Faubus, responding to political urging from other Southern governors as well as polls showing that 85 percent of the state's residents opposed school desegregation, sent in the National Guard to stop blacks from attending. Governor Faubus said that ''blood would run in the streets'' if they tried. A forewarning of the escalating tension was a rock tossed through the Bateses' window. A note was tied to it, saying: ''Stone this time. Dynamite next.''         The first day of school, the black  students were turned away with bayonets at the schoolhouse door. Racial and sexual epithets were hurled at them. Mr. and Mrs. Bates were at the scene. The next day, the National Guard stepped in again.         Then President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent in the federal troops, rebuffing Governor Faubus's pleas for a one-year cooling-off period. In her book, Mrs. Bates tells of waiting for a call from the school superintendent telling her to bring the children the next day. She had told the parents that if they did not hear from her by 10 p.m. to take their phones off the hook and get some sleep. But the superintendent called after that and said that the next day, Sept. 24, the children should come to school.         Mr. and Mrs. Bates spent the next three hours visiting the parents. The next morning all the children showed up at the Bates home to be picked up by a military convoy.         ''My eyes none too dry, I saw the parents with tears of happiness in their eyes as they watched the group drive off,'' Mrs. Bates wrote.         Two years later, the Bateses'  newspaper closed as advertisements slowed to almost nothing. She served in various civil rights positions both locally and nationally and was the only woman who spoke at the March on Washington in 1963. In an interview in 1986, she said: ''I'm 75 and a half. But I'm not too tired to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I would like to see before I die that blacks and whites and Christians can all get together.''         In recent years, Mrs. Bates suffered a series of strokes. ''She just wore out,'' her niece, Sharon T. Gatson, said.         She is survived by four brothers,  Leo Gatson of Strong, Ark., Kucas and Lowell Gatson of Spearville, La., and Emmitt Gatson of Detroit.         On Monday, her body will lie in state on the second-floor rotunda of the Arkansas Capitol. Just a few feet away is the office where Governor  Faubus orchestrated the 1957 confrontation.       
         Eufrosina Raileanu, the principal violist of the New York City Opera Orchestra and a busy freelance player who worked with several chamber groups, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 39 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, said Sato Moughalian, a friend.         Ms. Raileanu, who was known as Zina, was born in Romania in 1960 and came to the United States in 1978 as part of a group of teenagers who had won musical competitions and were allowed to study abroad. Ms. Raileanu, along with most of the others in the group, decided to remain in the United States.         She earned a master's degree at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and a doctorate at the Juilliard School, where she studied with Lillian Fuchs.         As a chamber music player, Ms. Raileanu performed as a guest with the Juilliard Quartet, the Mendelssohn Quartet, the Sea Cliff Chamber Players, the Da Capo Chamber Players and the Chelsea Chamber Ensemble. She joined the New York City Opera as principal violist in 1988.         In addition to her work at the New York City Opera, she was a substitute violist for the New York Philharmonic and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, with which she toured and recorded.         Ms. Raileanu is survived by her mother, Sylvia, of Brooklyn; a brother, Val, of Manhattan; and her father, Nicolau, who lives in Romania.       
         Jeraldyne Blunden, the founder and artistic director of the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, died on Monday at the Franciscan Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. She was 58 and lived in Dayton.         The cause was renal failure, said Phyllis Brzozowska, executive director of Dayton Contemporary Dance.         In addition to guiding the small modern-dance troupe to national prominence over its 30 years of existence, Mrs. Blunden developed a number of leading American modern dance performers, among them the former Alvin Ailey star Donna Wood. Mrs. Blunden, who was awarded a MacArthur Foundation grant in 1994, was also a major and much-honored proponent of the contributions of black choreographers and performers to American modern dance.         But Mrs. Blunden had mixed feelings about that role. ''Everything in America is labeled,'' she said in a 1996 interview. ''You could call what I do black dance because I'm a black-dance person. What I do is from a black perspective. But people who are sure of themselves don't bother with that.'' That no-nonsense approach to life was mixed with steely determination, a great personal warmth and humor and an unsentimental humanity that made her a much-loved figure on the national dance scene.         Mrs. Blunden began her dance training at 8, in Dayton, her hometown, with Josephine and Hermene Schwarz , the founders of the Dayton Ballet. As a teenage student at the American Dance Festival, Mrs. Blunden had her first important experience of modern dance. ''There was Martha Graham,'' she recalled in 1996. ''Jose Limon. Merce Cunningham was the new young man on the block and we flocked to his classes, of course. My first musical concert away from home was John Cage. I thought I was in the wrong place because he played everything but the keys on the piano.'' Dayton Contemporary Dance Company would later become the first black dance troupe to acquire a Cunningham work, ''Channels/Inserts.''         Mrs. Blunden performed with several ballet and modern companies in Dayton, continuing her dancing through college, marriage and motherhood, when she began to teach. She took her students to regional ballet competitions around the country and raised money to bring them to a summer session at Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem in New York. She formed the company to give her dancers a place to perform, at first creating the repertory herself. One of her early dancers was her daughter, Debbie Blunden-Diggs. She chose her daughter along with the choreographer and dancer Kevin Ward to succeed her as artistic directors of the company.         Mrs. Blunden's honors also included the Dance Magazine Award of 1998 and the 1999 Dance USA Honors Award. In 1997, she was one of five female dance company directors honored as ''living legends'' by 651: An Arts Center.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Charles Blunden, her mother, Winifred Kilborn, and a sister, Carol Ann Shockley, all of Dayton; a son, Derek, of Charleston, W. Va., and four grandchildren.       
         Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition from Bangladesh.         As the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about 10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on Wednesday in Dhaka.         Born into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious fundamentalism.         ''This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the ceremony. ''This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building up womenfolk as self-reliant.''         Sufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer. As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education, but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's encouragement.         She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and Mr. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married Kamaluddin Ahmed.         In addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three great-granddaughters.         She published her first story at 14,  and her prose and poems drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions. She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.         ''The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview earlier this year. ''There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family also believed that women should stay out of it.         ''But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali from people working in the house.'' That became the language she used for her writing.         Though she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970's she worked to help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the Bangladeshis considered war criminals.         In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.         ''My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ''Be poor or middle class or upper class, the violence against women in family, society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited and deprived of opportunities.''         In 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her execution as punishment for her denunciation of the fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of reprisals.         Ms. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have appeared in her poems rather than her prose.         One poem, ''Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with the following lines:         For our language many have died,         drawn from the arms of our mother         but down the road, smeared with their blood         I hope freedom will come to this land:         the simple language of a simple people         Will meet the demands of this our land.         Before her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried. Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview earlier this year, suggest why.         ''Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said. ''Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack courage.''       
         Bethel Leslie, a lifelong presence onstage and on television whose final Broadway performance earned her a Tony nomination, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said Leslie McCullough Jeffries, her daughter.         The daughter of a lawyer and a socialite, Ms. Leslie was a 15-year-old student at the Brearley School on the Upper East Side when she was discovered by the producer George Abbott and cast as the girl next door in the 1944 Broadway production of ''Snafu,'' a comedy.         The role began Ms. Leslie's career, which included appearances in 10 Broadway plays before she was 25 and which had her acting alongside the likes of Fredric March (''Years Ago,'' in 1946), Sam Wanamaker (''Goodbye, My Fancy'' in 1948) and Helen Hayes (''The Wisteria Trees,'' in 1950).         Her breakthrough came in 1955, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in which she played the conflicted daughter of a Bible-wielding reverend. The part earned Ms. Leslie strong reviews, and she soon headed to Hollywood. There she found steady work in television, parlaying her dark good looks into roles on shows like ''Gunsmoke,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''The Fugitive.''         A 1965 press biography listed some of her character roles as ''a cheating wife, a husband-framing mistress'' and ''the wife of a confessed murderer.''         Ms. Leslie made her film debut in 1964 in ''Captain Newman, M.D.,'' as the wife of a traumatized Air Force pilot, played by Robert Duvall.         By 1965 she had returned to New York and to the theater, though appearances on soap operas helped support that passion. As a side pursuit Ms. Leslie began to write, eventually becoming a head writer for the daytime drama ''The Secret Storm.''         It was not until 1986, however, that she scored her biggest triumph, appearing as the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey into Night,'' a performance that Frank Rich of The New York Times called ''exceptionally beautiful.'' Her work earned her a Tony nomination.         In recent years she appeared Off Broadway in productions with the Signature Theater Company and most recently with the Women's Project, where she won praise this spring for her work in Joan Vail Thorne's play ''Exact Center of the Universe.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York, Ms. Leslie is survived by a brother, Warren Leslie, also of New York, and two grandchildren.       
         Ranjabati Sircar, a dancer and choreographer who fused India's classical and folk dance traditions with experimental forms from the West, died in Bombay on Oct. 23. She was 36 and lived in Calcutta.         The cause was unknown, said Jonathan Hollander, a friend and the artistic director of the Battery Dance Company in New York.         Ms. Sircar was the daughter of Manjusri Chaki-Sircar, one of India's best-known dancers. Together they established a school in Calcutta, Dancers' Guild, that focused on what they called navanritya, a contemporary form of Indian dance with its own technique and training system.         Ms. Sircar was born in Nigeria and grew up in the United States. She graduated from Jadavpur University in Calcutta and trained in classical and folk dance in India. She sought, however, a creative synthesis of modern dance from the West with classical Indian traditions.         In 1990 she participated in the International Choreographers Workshop of the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and in 1992 she founded the South Asian Dance Youth Company, which won her the London Dance and Performance Award. Ms. Sircar wrote ''Navanritya: Toward Contemporary Indian Dance.'' She is survived by her mother, of Calcutta.       
         Mabel King, an actress and singer best known for her portrayal of Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West, in the Broadway and movie productions of ''The Wiz'' and her role as the mother in the mid-70's television comedy ''What's Happening!'' died on Nov. 9 at a hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 66.         She died after a long illness and complications from diabetes, said a friend, Vickie Chamberlain.         Ms. King was born on Dec. 25, 1932, in Charleston, S.C., and grew up in Harlem. She appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' early in her career and later made guest appearances on many other television shows, including ''Barney Miller,'' ''Fantasy Island,'' ''The Jeffersons'' and ''Wiseguy.''         She appeared in nine movies, including ''Scrooged'' (1988); ''The Jerk'' (1979), in which she played Steve Martin's mother; ''The Gong Show Movie'' (1980); and ''The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings'' (1976).         In 1975 she appeared in the play  ''The Wiz,'' an all-black musical based on L. Frank Baum's ''Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' that was later made into a movie; Ms. King had the same role in the film version. She also worked on Broadway in productions of ''A Race With the Wind'' and ''The Women.''         Ms. King's most visible role was as Mrs. Thomas, or Mama, in the ABC series ''What's Happening!'' from 1976 to 1979.         She is survived by her mother, Rosalee Washington, and a sister, Rose Washington, both of Manhattan. Her son, Larry, died in 1996.       
         Gloria Caruso Murray, a visual artist who was the last surviving child of Enrico Caruso, died on Dec. 5 at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 79 and had briefly tried to live up to the musical world's sentimental fantasy that she had inherited her father's vocal abilities.         She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso Museum in Brooklyn.         Only hours after his daughter's birth on Dec. 18, 1919, at the Knickerbocker Hotel just a stone's throw from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, Caruso, then the most famous operatic tenor in the world, exuberantly tossed the girl into the air, peered into her mouth and announced, ''Ah, she has the vocal cords, just like her daddy!''         A year and a half later, Caruso was dead at 48 -- a loss that nourished a popular fantasy that his child would also have an extraordinary voice.         At age 7, when she and her mother returned to New York from a vacation in Europe, a New York newspaper ran the headline ''Gloria Caruso, Here With a Voice'' and pronounced her ''a potential opera star of the first magnitude.''         The next year she made her first record. At 11, she made her first public appearance, delivering a radio address on behalf of a charity headed by President Herbert Hoover. Later that year she made a test recording for RCA Victor, and John McCormack, another renowned tenor, gave her singing lessons and announced that she had promise.         The press had an immense appetite for even the slightest tidbits of news about the great Caruso's daughter. But it gradually became apparent that she did not have the voice to follow her father.         In 1942, Ms. Murray told a reporter that she was studying art at the Art Students League in New York and that she had come to prefer the visual arts to music. ''I've always been torn between art and music,'' she said. ''Daddy drew and sculptured as a hobby. And Mommy draws. Art is as much in the family as singing.''         In marrying Caruso, her mother, an American named Dorothy Benjamin, created a tumult in 1918. Her father, Park Benjamin, a wealthy patent lawyer and New York society figure, fiercely opposed the match between his daughter, then 25, to Caruso, who was 45. After the couple eloped, Park Benjamin disowned her. When he died in 1925, he left her $1 from his substantial estate.         In 1943, Gloria Caruso married Ensign Michael Hunt Murray, who had left Harvard to become a naval aviator in World War II. The couple had two sons but later divorced.         Ms. Murray set up a studio in New York City where she painted both portraits and landscapes. Later she lived in Miami and, for the last 10 years, in Jacksonville.         Andrew Farkas, co-author with Enrico Caruso Jr. of ''Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family'' (Amadeus Press, 1990), said that Ms. Murray's paintings were ''of good quality, although she sold very few.''         ''She became rather reclusive,'' Mr. Farkas said, adding, ''She had been answering questions about her father for a long time.'' Eric D. Murray, one of Ms. Murray's sons, said his mother had become occupied with managing the family estate after her mother died in 1957.         Matters were complicated because Caruso had left no will. In 1928, a court in Trenton had ruled that Gloria Caruso was entitled to two-thirds of the royalties on her father's phonograph records, sold by the Victor Talking Machine Company.         Gloria Caruso attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City, the Ozanne School in Paris, the Bishop School in La Jolla, Calif., and Miss Nixon's School in Florence, Italy.         In addition to her son Eric, of Maryland, she is survived by her other son, Colin D. Murray of Jacksonville.         Mr. Farkas wrote that Enrico Caruso had four children from a relationship with Ada Giacchetti, a soprano who had left her husband to live with the tenor before his marriage to Miss Benjamin. Only one, Enrico Caruso Jr., sought a career as a singer. All are deceased.       
         Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of Britain's first successful female film directors and whose half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday in London. She was 85.         Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with ''Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ''The Way We Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on Plymouth, and ''Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that she met Mr. Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him and a relationship began.         Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.         ''I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she once said. ''I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people. I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I was lonely.''         After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper. She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.         Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ''The Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she made through Mr. Dell to get work in the British film industry, first making sports films and later turning to feature-length documentaries.         During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many prominent artists and writers.         Mr. Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage the concerns of Mr. Foot's family.         Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to be a close and loving relationship, friends said.         She is survived by her husband and daughter.         Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ''The Million Pound Note,'' renamed ''Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film starring Gregory Peck that was filmed in London.         In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.         For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at work on a  history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.         In 1967, she made a television documentary called ''Who Are the Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she made ''Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former Yugoslavia.         As Mr. Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Mr. Foot became chief of the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie demurred.         ''He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice house,'' she said.       
         Felicia Lamport, a poet and satirist who took delight in skewering the high and mighty with verse, quips, puns and parodies, most of them first appearing in a column in The Boston Globe called Muse of the Week in Review, died on Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 83.         Ms. Lamport's column appeared in The Globe since 1981 but her work also appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's and other publications.         Her first collection of poetry, ''Mink on Weekdays (Ermine on Sunday)'' (1950), became a best seller and was followed by other collections with titles like ''Scrap Irony'' (1961), ''Cultural Slag'' (1966) and ''Political Plumlines'' (1984).         She was born in New York and graduated from Vassar College in 1937, after which she worked as a reporter and wrote dialogue for MGM films.         She is survived by her husband, Benjamin Kaplan, a retired justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts; a son, James Kaplan of Northampton, Mass., a daughter, Nancy Mansbach of Newton, Mass.,  and four grandchildren.         She was particularly remembered for a work called ''The Love Song of R. Milhous Nixon,'' in which she borrowed from T. S. Eliot to lampoon President Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal in 1973. It began:         Let us go then, in my plane,         For a weekend of repose in Key Biscayne;         When the view beneath our eyes appears unstable         Let us banish all incipient defeats         In one of my retreats.         Apart from political jabs, Ms. Lamport also turned her attention to the human comedy, with verse like:         The after-effects of a mother's neglects         May spoil her boy's orientation to sex,         But the converse is worse: if she overprotects,         The pattern of Oedipus wrecks. In April William Safire praised Ms. Lamport in The New York Times Magazine as ''the leading muse of the Deprefixers,'' which he defined as poets who achieve effects by dropping prefixes, for lines like ''Men often pursue in suitable style/ The imical girl with the scrutable smile.''       
         Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the company, died on Sunday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.         Her title for many years was simply general manager, but Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight and was unknown to the balletgoing public. A woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.         Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the City Ballet, described her role in ''Thirty Years,'' his history of the organization, ''at once labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ''proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and impossible.''         Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo, then moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an assistant editor at John Bernard Myers's literary journal View and an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that gained her entry into the world of New York poets, artists and intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940's.         It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart, where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired in 1985. Her first job there was as an assistant to Frances Hawkins, the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who, as chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948, extended a crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City Ballet.         Ms. Cage was an avid practitioner  of tai chi, the Chinese system of movement. She collaborated with her husband, Edward Maisel, on ''Tai Chi for Health,'' published in 1972. Ms. Cage also taught unofficial tai chi classes at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Elizabeth Zimmermann, who brought a penetrating intellect and a sculptor's sensitivity to revolutionizing the ancient art of knitting, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis., where she lived. She was 89.         Mrs. Zimmermann's best-known gift to knitting was a mathematical formula for figuring the proportions of sweaters and other garments, depending on how many stitches per inch the knitter wanted to use. But her passion, expressed in magazine columns, in four books and at her knitting camp, the nation's first, was creating beauty. She gently urged knitters to challenge the limits of their imaginations.         ''She allowed people to be intuitive about their knitting, rather than just being blind followers of the written word,'' said Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Knitter's Magazine. ''She had a way of being breezy and fun. She made everything seem easy.''         Linda Ligon, president of Interweave Press, which specializes in traditional textile crafts, said Mrs. Zimmermann ''brought intelligence and validity to a craft that had been trivialized as women's work.''         Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones was born near Devon, England, in 1910, the daughter of a naval officer and the woman who invented Meals by Motor, a British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Her youthful memories, as recalled in ''Knitting Around'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1989), suggested a bucolic paradise, framed by plum trees and plum jam, governesses and private schools.         ''I had a wonderful hideyhole in a gone-to-seed cabbage patch,'' Mrs. Zimmermann said, ''and one day had the excitement and glory of falling through the roof of an abandoned chicken house, garnering the first permanent scar on my leg.''         The women of her mother's family knitted. One day, she asked her mother if she could try knitting, perhaps the most important words she ever uttered.         ''If you're good all day today, I'll teach you tomorrow,'' her mother answered.         Miss Lloyd-Jones attended art schools in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Munich, where she sold sweaters of her own design to a local shop for pocket money. She also met Arnold Zimmermann, a brewer. He had to flee Hitler's Germany because an SS agent overheard him making a snide remark about Hitler. They married in England, immigrated to New York and moved several times before settling in Wisconsin.         Mrs. Zimmermann began spending morning after morning with local knitters, exchanging tips. She became frustrated with many of her friends' lockstep reliance on precise instructions in printed patterns. So, in 1955, she submitted her designs for Norwegian-pattern sweaters to Woman's Day magazine, resolving to use clear language. Other magazines also accepted her designs, and in 1959, she started her own knitting publication.         About the same time, the family, with three children, moved into a derelict schoolhouse in the middle of the woods and remodeled it. She combined her newsletter with a mail-order business for knitting supplies, books and video productions under the name Schoolhouse Press.         She was hostess of a knitting program shown on many public television stations and in 1974 began a knitting camp under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. The camp has continued every summer since. She also led workshops throughout the United States and in New Zealand.         Besides ''Knitting Around,'' her books included ''Knitting Without Tears'' (Scribner's/Macmillan, 1971), Knitter's Almanac (Scribner's/Dover, 1975) and ''Knitting Workshop'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1981).         She was a woman who held to strong principles about her work, like never using any thread but wool. But she never criticized another knitter's use of other materials, including the dreaded polyester. She developed a reputation for giving pithy advice.         ''A knitter's question which arises perennially,'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac, ''is, 'How much wool should I buy?' ''         She said there was no blanket answer, but advised, ''If you are using very thick wool, buy more than you could possibly imagine; if you are using very thin wool, use surprisingly little.''         But Mrs. Zimmermann's larger influence was in design, making sweaters and other garments in round tubes, rather than in flat pieces to be joined together. The result was a sculptural quality, said her daughter Meg Swansen, who is also a noted knitter and will carry on her mother's business. By contrast, Kaffe Fassett, a knitter whose work is often exhibited in art galleries, is known for his painterly approach, she said.         But Ms. Ligon said sculptural effects were just the beginning. She said Mrs. Zimmermann's mathematical formula for constructing sweaters in the round freed knitters to concentrate on other creative concerns, like yarn and stitches.         ''She was more than a sculptor,'' Ms. Ligon said. ''She was an engineer.''         Many knitters said the system opened up new possibilities to them.  ''She made me a thinking knitter,'' said Joyce Williams of Sparta, Wis., who attended three knitting camps with Mrs. Zimmermann.         A woman from Reading, Mass., in an online customer review of ''Knitting Without Tears'' on Amazon.com, said: ''Elizabeth's wonderful instructions, comments and faith gave me the O.K. to go ahead and have fun. I made a patterned yoke sweater that not only looks great, but fits as well.''         In addition to Ms. Swansen, who lives in Pittsville, Wis., Mrs. Zimmermann is survived by her husband, Arnold; another daughter, Lloie, of Pittsville; a son, Thomas, of New Hope, Pa.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.         Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting, coining the term ''unventions'' for her woolly inventions.         ''The products of science and technology may be new, and some of them are quite horrid, but knitting?'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac. ''In knitting there are ancient possibilities; the earth is enriched with the dust of millions of knitters who have held wool and needles since the beginning of sheep.''
