She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         A native of Minneapolis, Mrs. Eiseman began her career in 1945 when her husband, Laurence, packed up some of the dainty, organdy pinafores she made as gifts for friends and took them to a buyer at Chicago's Marshall Field & Company. He came home with a $3,000 order.         Ten years later she became the first children's designer to receive the Neiman Marcus award for her contributions to fashion, an honor that has also gone to Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, James Galanos and Norman Norell. Designs Honored by Museum         Early features of Mrs. Eiseman designs included French seams, hand-sewn hems, bound buttonholes and hand-rolled edges. Among those who dressed their children in her clothes were Princess Grace of Monoco, members of the Kennedy family and Elizabeth Taylor.         In 1964 the Denver Art Museum highlighted her career in a fashion retrospective that is believed to be the first time that a designer of children's wear was so honored by a museum.         ''Florence Eiseman has been one of the most influential figures in the children's fashion industry over the last several decades,'' said Carla Slocum, vice president and merchandise manager of children's wear for Saks Fifth Avenue. ''She was responsible for raising the standards of fashion and quality in better children's wear.''         Mr. Eiseman worked closely with his wife until his death in 1967. Their sons, Robert and Laurence Jr., then shared management with their mother and today are chief executive officer and president of the Florence Eiseman Inc. respectively.         In addition to her sons, Mrs. Eiseman is survived by a sister, Eva Tankel, of Minneapolis, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         An interior and furniture designer, Pat Hoffman, as she was known professionally, was influential in introducing avant-garde and early 20th-century European designs to the United States.         Ms. Hoffman was born March 7, 1943, in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Design. From 1965 to 1970, she worked as director of design for Koch & Lowy, a lighting firm in New York City. After spending two years in Rome working for an architectural firm, Ms. Hoffman returned to New York to join I.C.F., in charge of the company's design programs, including graphics, advertising and showroom design.         For the last 15 years, Ms. Hoffman was instrumental in introducing designs that quickly became synonymous with the avant-garde. In the early 1970's, that included Giovanetti's Anfibio sofa, by Alessandro Becchi, an oversize leather upholstered raftlike sofa bed from Italy and the Interlubke system, a sleek German storage system. Introduced International Designs         Most influential in the modern home furnishings field was Ms. Hoffman's introduction in 1975 of the furniture designs by Josef Hoffmann, the Viennese leader of the early 20th-century Wiener Werkstatte movement. The Hoffmann furniture designs were pivotal in the rediscovery and revival of many other early 20th-century classics and played a critical role in the current interest in this important period of 20th-century design.         A lamp Ms. Hoffman designed in 1969 was exhibited in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985. Some of her other furniture designs have been shown at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, as well as at the Mobelmesse, in Cologne, West Germany, the Salon International de Meubles in Paris and the Saloni di Mobili in Milan.         Ms. Hoffman is survived by her husband, Samuel Friedman, president of I.C.F.; her parents, John and Mae Hoffman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a sister, Jane Knaus.         The funeral will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.

Upon her father's death in 1950, her husband succeeded him as the Rebbe, or grand rabbi, of Lubavitch, one of the major remaining Hasidic dynasties. In keeping with Hasidic tradition, Mrs. Schneerson never held formal office in the Lubavitch organization, but ''she was very much behind the scenes,'' according to her husband's close aide, Rabbi Yehudah Krinsky.         ''In her quiet behind-the-scenes way, she was involved in every activity of Lubavitch,'' he said.         Surviving are her husband and a sister, Hannah Gourary.

She was 89 years old and lived in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.         Lea Lake, for the last 55 years a proprietor of Sweet's, the oldest seafood restaurant in New York City, died of heart failure at Lutheran Hospital in Brooklyn on Sunday. She was 89 years old and lived in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn.         Miss Lake was involved with the restaurant from her childhood.         It was founded in 1842 by Abraham M. Sweet on Fulton Street in Manhattan in what is now the South Street Seaport. Miss Lake's father, James, walked into the restaurant on the morning after the Great Blizzard of 1888 asking for work and was hired as a waterboy - the job today known as busboy. Twenty-nine years later he bought Sweet's from the proprietor's son, Edward.         Miss Lake took over on the death of her father in 1933. A small, soft-voiced woman, she was in charge for many decades. One of the first things she did in 1933 was to discontinue the boarding house that had been an adjunct of the restaurant since its early days.         Sweet's operated continuously in the block known as Schermerhorn Row, between South and Front Streets, except for two periods. One was in the years just before and during the Civil War, and the other covered 18 months in 1982 and 1983 when the landmark house occupied by the restaurant was restored.         Miss Lake's partner, Andrew Gerzel, who has managed the restaurant since 1966, recalled last night that as a young woman, she had aspired to a career in show business and had appeared in at least one Broadway musical in the 1920's.         Miss Lake is survived by her sister, Queenie A. McFarland of Caldwell, N.J.

The daughter of Alicia Spaulding, a United Fruit Company heiress, and Count Lorenzo Paolozzi, she was born in New York, grew up in Rome, and was educated in Switzerland and at the Madeira School in Greenway, Va.         She began her modeling career in New York at age 17. A nude photograph of her by Richard Avedon in Harper's Bazaar in 1962 caused a sensation. Unclothed figures did not appear in fashion magazines at that time.         In 1964, she married Dr. Howard Bellin, a plastic surgeon. They were known for their lively parties attended by an eclectic group that included Andy Warhol, Jacob K. Javits, Zsa Zsa Gabor, karate instructors and whatever glamorous personality happened to be in town, Dr. Bellin recalled. They were divorced in 1982, remarried four months later when Mrs. Bellin fell ill, and divorced again when she seemed to be recovering.         She is survived by two sons, Marco and Andy, her sister, Francesca, and her mother, all of Manhattan.         The funeral will be at 3 P.M. tomorrow at St. James Episcopal Church, at 865 Madison Avenue, at 71st Street in Manhattan.         Correction:  April 30, 1988, Saturday, Late City Final Edition

Gertrude Soule, a Shaker leader whose storytelling helped visitors understand a rapidly disappearing religious community, has died at 93, leaving only two Shaker women in their 90's in the state.         Richard Kathmann, director at Shaker Village, said today that Miss Soule died in her sleep over the weekend.

They abandon their efforts after a series of mistakes. 4 Films Still to Be Released Mrs. Ramsey was nominated for an Oscar this year for ''Throw Momma,'' but lost to Olympia Dukakis of ''Moonstruck.'' She will be seen in four films that have yet to be released: ''Doctor Hackenstein,'' ''Scrooge,'' ''Good Ol' Boy'' and ''Homer and Eddie.'' Mrs. Ramsey's show business career spanned 37 years.         She appeared in two Barbra Streisand films, ''Up the Sandbox'' and ''For Pete's Sake.''         Mrs. Ramsey's television credits included roles in ''The Young and the Restless,'' guest appearances on ''Hill Street Blues,'' ''Night Court'' and ''Knight Rider,'' and movies-of-the-week roles in ''White Mama,'' ''The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,'' ''Blind Ambition'' and ''Marilyn.''         The actress often appeared with her husband, Logan Ramsey, in projects, including Clint Eastwood's ''Any Which Way You Can.''

Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson.

        A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.         A former Queen of Egypt, Safinaz Zulfikar, better known as Queen Farida, the wife of King Farouk, died in a hospital here today of leukemia. A hospital announcement said she was 68 years old.         The Queen, an Egyptian, was married to the young Farouk in 1939. The wedding, carried out accordina to strict Islamic custom at the time, was held in her absence, though with great fanfare and pageantry. After the wedding, she was renamed Farida in accordance with the tradition that all members of the royal family have the same initial.         In 1948, Farouk divorced her after she had given birth to three daughters but failed to produce a male heir. The divorce aroused both great interest and antipathy in the West, both because of Farida's youth and beauty and because the King was regarded by many as the personification of a corrupt old order.         At the same time as Farida was divorced, King Farouk's sister, Queen Fawzia, described in the press as one of the world's most beautiful women, was divorced by the Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.         In 1952, Farouk was deposed in a military coup led, among others, by then-Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser. He died in exile in Italy in 1965.         The former Queen lived most of her life in Paris with her three daughters. An artist, she returned to Cairo to live in 1974.
