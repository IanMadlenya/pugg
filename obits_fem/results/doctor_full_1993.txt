         Adina Blady Szwajger, a pediatrician who struggled to save young lives in the Children's Hospital in the Warsaw ghetto and survived to recount the horrors, died Feb. 18 in Lodz, Poland. She was 75 and lived in Warsaw.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said Jerzy Warman, a friend in Manhattan.         When the Nazis finally shut the hospital Dr. Szwajger (pronounced SHVY-gher), despite her Jewishness, escaped the ghetto with special identity papers, then worked with the resistance.         After the war she resumed work as a pediatrician and occasionally spoke about her harrowing experiences. But she kept the most haunting episode a secret for decades, until she was ill and in retirement.         Her memoirs circulated in a Solidarity underground magazine in the mid-1980's, then were published in the West in 1988.  'Damning and Uplifting'         In a review of the Pantheon edition in The New York Times, Kati Marton said: "Dr. Szwajger's unsentimental, almost matter-of-fact memoir of the German occupation of Poland is the most damning and most uplifting of the many accounts of the Holocaust that I have read. I did not think the well-covered ground of Nazi atrocities could still astonish. 'I Remember Nothing More: The Warsaw Children's Hospital and the Jewish Resistance' proved me wrong."         Her story began with the high hopes of a young medical student from the University of Warsaw. She described herself as bubbling, happy and proud to help youngsters at the hospital.         But soon the hospital was filled with youngsters dying from tuberculosis, typhus and starvation. The Nazis occupiers sealed off the ghetto and eventually marched a steady stream of people to their deaths.         "So we tried to save them with those scraps of food, medicines and injections," she wrote. Some children revived enough to smile -- "except that this was the kind of smile that made your hair stand on end and your flesh crawl." She described "famished skeletons" fighting over the soup pot, spilling it and lapping the slop off the floor.  'Corpses and Living Together'         Every day she went to a square to looking for stray children, befriending a Ukrainian guard with vodka.         "Once he was talking to me when a little girl appeared at a window," she wrote. "He raised his gun, shot her and carried on talking to me. I picked up a child, said goodbye to him and walked away -- only I didn't know how to hold the child so that it wouldn't be hit if the Ukrainian shot at me."         At the hospital, toward the end, "corpses and living all lay together" as soldiers killed some patients and ordered others to the death camps. A nurse pleaded with Dr. Szwajger to inject the nurse's bedridden mother with a lethal dose of morphine.         The doctor agreed. She also decided -- and this secret she kept for 45 years -- to carry out euthanasia on some of the children. In the infants' ward, she spoonfed each of them a fatal dose of morphine.         "Just as, during those two years of real work in the hospital, I had bent down over the little beds," she wrote, "so now I poured this last medicine into those tiny mouths. And downstairs there was screaming because the Germans were already there, taking the sick from the wards to the cattle trucks." 'Why I Was Different'         She told the older children to get into bed, and "this medicine was going to make their pain disappear."         "So they lay down and after a few minutes ----," she wrote. "I don't know how many. But the next time I went into that room, they were asleep. And then I don't know what happened after that."         That memory never left, "and that's why I was always different from everybody else."         Dr. Szwajger's husband, a law student, was killed by the Nazis, who tricked him into turning himself in. Later she became pregnant by a man in the resistance. But she arranged an abortion, and also arranged abortions for three other women, because she was convinced that "children had no right to be born" into such a world.         Dr. Szwajger later married Wladyslaw Swidowski, who died several years ago. She is survived by two daughters, Hanna and Alina, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, all in Poland.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.  Plays         Bab 1920  We Moderns 1923  Caesar and Cleopatra 1925  What Every Woman Knows 1926, 1938, 1954  Coquette 1927  Mary of Scotland 1933  Victoria Regina 1935  Ladies and Gentlemen 1939  Twelfth Night 1940  Harriet 1943  Happy Birthday 1946  The Wisteria Trees 1950  Mrs. McThing 1952  The Skin of Our Teeth 1955, 1961  The Glass Menagerie 1948, 1956, 1961  Time Remembered 1957  A Touch of the Poet 1958  The School for Scandal 1966  Right You Are (If You Think You Are) 1966  We Comrades Three 1966  The Show-Off 1967  The Front Page 1969  Harvey 1970 Films         The Sin of Madelon Claudet 1931  Arrowsmith 1931  A Farewell to Arms 1932  Night Flight 1933  What Every Woman Knows 1934  Vanessa, Her Love Story 1935  My Son John 1952  Anastasia 1956  Airport 1970 Television         The Snoop Sisters 1972  Victory at Entebbe 1976  A Family Upside Down 1978  Murder Is Easy 1982  A Caribbean Mystery 1983  Murder With Mirrors 1985       
         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Elizabeth Montgomery, a costume and set designer and a founding partner of the design company Motley, died on Saturday at her home in London. She was 91.         Miss Montgomery was born in Kid lington, Oxfordshire, and grew up in Cambridge, England. She attended Westminster Art School in London, studying portrait painting with Walter Sickert. In 1932, she and two other art students, Margaret Harris and Sophia Harris, founded a theatrical design group, which they named Motley, an allusion to the line "Motley's the only wear" from "As You Like It."         Motley created its first costumes for "Romeo and Juliet," directed by John Gielgud at Oxford University, and the company soon made its mark with costumes for his production of "Richard of Bordeaux." The Gielgud collaboration continued for the next decade. The company created sets and costumes for more than 30 Old Vic productions. An American Branch         In 1940, Miss Montgomery and Margaret Harris traveled to the United States as the costume designers for "Romeo and Juliet," starring Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. After marrying the writer Robert P. Wilmot, Miss Montgomery took up residence in the United States.         As the American branch of Motley, she and Miss Harris created costumes for Katharine Cornell in "The Doctor's Dilemma" and "The Three Sisters" in the early 1940's. Miss Harris returned to Britain in 1946. Miss Montgomery's later Broadway credits include "Anne of the Thousand Days," "Peter Pan" "South Pacific," "The Most Happy Fella," "Paint Your Wagon" and "Can-Can."         In 1958, her costumes for "The First Gentleman" won a Tony Award. That year she designed sets and costumes for "Il Trovatore" at the Metropolitan Opera.         Motley created the costumes for the David Lean film "Great Expectations," and Miss Montgomery designed the costumes for "Oklahoma!," "Little Women" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night."         The partners in Motley wrote two books, "Designing and Making Stage Costumes" (1964, reissued by Routledge in 1992) and "Theater Props" (1975).         She is survived by a son, John Wilmot of Fremantle, Australia, and four stepdaughters: Patricia Christgau of Woodbury, Conn., Dorothy Zinbardi of Brentwood, L.I., Roberta Wilmot of Idaho and Joan Clarke of Spokane, Wash.       
         Dr. Harriet L. Hardy, a pioneer in occupational medicine and the first woman to become a full professor at Harvard Medical School, died on Wednesday in Boston. She was 87.         Dr. Hardy died from lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system, at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had worked since 1940, hospital officials said.         Dr. Hardy set out to become a country doctor but developed an early interest in toxicology and environmentally related illness. Her investigation of respiratory illness among factory workers in Lynn and Salem, Mass., in the mid-1940's led to the discovery that they had come down with berylliosis, an often fatal disease caused by exposure to the light metal beryllium.         Berylliosis results from inhaling dust or fumes containing beryllium, but the symptoms may not emerge until 10 to 20 years after exposure to even a small amount of the metal. The disease, which develops in only a small percentage of people who are exposed, can produce coughing, shortness of breath, weight loss and scarring of the lungs. Created a Model Registry         Dr. Hardy set up a registry of beryllium illness that the hospital still maintains. The registry became a model for tracking other occupational hazards and establishing guidelines for their control.         In 1947, Dr. Hardy created an occupational medicine clinic at the hospital and remained its director until she retired in 1971. Dr. Hardy also led the occupational medical service at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge for more than 20 years and advised the institute on safety considerations relating to its first nuclear reactor. She also helped coordinate the study of industrial diseases at Dartmouth College.         Dr. Hardy was not the first woman appointed to the Harvard Medical School faculty but was its first full professor. That appointment did not come until the end of her career, in 1971, when she was made clinical professor of medicine.         Dr. Homayoun Kazemi, chief of pulmonary and critical care at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Hardy was "very kind, yet bombastic, never hesitating to express her opinions."         "She spoke her mind, and there was no ambiguity about what she said," Dr. Kazemi said. Began as School Doctor         Harriet Louise Hardy was born in Arlington, Mass., on Sept. 23, 1905. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1928, received her medical degree from Cornell University in 1932, and went on to train as an intern and resident at Philadelphia General Hospital.         She began her career as school doctor at the Northfield School in western Massachusetts. In 1939, Dr. Hardy became college doctor and head of health education at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, where she developed an interest in women's growth and physical fitness.         Her lifelong interest in beryllium poisoning developed from her investigation of a mysterious respiratory illness that had occurred among workers making fluorescent lamps at the General Electric and Sylvania plants on Boston's north shore. Many of those affected were women.         At the time, Dr. Hardy was working on problems of lead poisoning with Dr. Joseph Aubt in Boston. He had been informed of the outbreak and told Dr. Hardy, "Something is happening in the factories, and they don't know what is going on." He encouraged her to investigate.         In linking the illness to beryllium, Dr. Hardy went back to work done in Russia and Germany in the 1920's and 1930's. Wrote a Standard Textbook         She described acute and chronic beryllium poisoning in papers in 1946 and 1947. About the same time, other groups described a similar illness among workers exposed to beryllium in Ohio.         The work of Dr. Hardy and others led to precautions that allowed safer use of beryllium.         Dr. Hardy worked with the Atomic Energy Commission in Los Alamos, N.M., to study hazards associated with nuclear energy. Beryllium is used in nuclear energy plants and the aerospace industry.         Dr. Hardy was a crusader against diseases caused by occupational exposure to dangerous substances. In 1954, she was among the first to link asbestos and cancer. She studied mercury poisoning and anthrax, a bacterial disease, among farm workers and was a pioneer in using drugs known as chelating agents to treat lead poisoning.         Dr. Hardy and Dr. Alice Hamilton, another occupational medicine pioneer, wrote a standard textbook on industrial toxicology. Dr. Hardy was the author of more than 100 scientific papers.         She is survived by four nephews.
