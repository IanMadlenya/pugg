         Marie Collins McGuire Thompson, who worked to improve the design of public housing for the elderly and low-income people as the Public Housing Administrator in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died last Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mrs. Thompson was 92 and lived in Kensington, Md.         Marie McGuire, as she was known, came to public housing with an aversion to ''bare, stark shelter'' that, she said, ''has brought no happiness to us.'' Instead, she espoused programs to create homes of which their occupants could be proud. Her advocacy drew criticism from legislators and defenders of traditional approaches, but architectural organizations backed her. Housing projects begun under her leadership won unaccustomed design awards.         She came to national attention as executive director of the San Antonio Housing Authority, where she championed amenities like balconies for every apartment. Studying the special needs of the elderly with limited means, she insisted on features like weatherproof ramps, handrails in all rooms and corridors and emergency bells in the bathrooms.         Her crowning achievement was the Golden Age Center, with 185 low-rent apartments designed for the elderly, that opened in 1960 in San Antonio. The next year, President John F. Kennedy recruited her as the first woman to become Public Housing Administrator. She held the post until 1966, when her office was merged into the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. There she became special assistant to the Secretary, working on housing and problems that affect the disabled and the elderly.         She left the Government in 1972. Until 1982, she was the housing specialist at the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, now the Center for Social Gerontology in Ann Arbor, Mich.         Mrs. Thompson was born in the Georgetown area of Washington. She studied journalism at George Washington University and, years later, studied architecture and real estate management at the University of Houston.         She wrote four books, ''Housing for the Elderly'' (1957), ''Housing and the Disabled'' (1976), ''Housing for the Handicapped'' (1977) and ''Housing for Rural Elderly'' (1982).         Her first marriage, to John McGuire, a Government geologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Thomas B. Thompson of San Antonio, an architect, died in 1983. She is survived by a sister, Margaret C. Schweinhaut, also of Kensington.       
         Mary Bancroft, a Boston Brahmin colleen who cut a coquettish swath through 20th-century history, bewitching men of power even as she did brilliant work as an American spy in Switzerland in World War II, died on Jan. 10 at her Fifth Avenue apartment. She was 93.         If Mary Bancroft had not existed, a hack novelist would surely have invented her, or tried.         Dime store fiction could undoubtedly have accommodated her cliche origins as the daughter of a patrician, Harvard-trained lawyer and a distinctly declasse Irish girl, who died in childbirth, setting up her father's marriage to a disapproving, if not quite wicked, stepmother.         He left his daughter to be reared by a paternal grandmother with such a haughty and virulent disdain for the Irish that it was years before Miss Bancroft learned that the woman had herself been an Irish working girl before marrying into the august Bancroft family.         It would have taken a Dickens to invent Nolan, the Bancroft coachman who became Miss Bancroft's constant childhood companion, sharing her delight in the day's news, especially of war and disaster.         And a Dickens could even have contrived for her father's second wife to be the stepdaughter of Clarence Barron, the short, rotund powerhouse owner of The Wall Street Journal who encouraged his step-granddaughter to meet and study people of all walks of life, ''even gamblers and crooks,'' and who gave her what became her credo as a sometime journalist and spy: ''Facts are not the truth but only indicate where the truth may lie.''         A novelist might have foreseen that a daring, restless woman would find Smith College such a bore that she would escape after a year into what turned out to be a stultifying marriage to a teen-age chum and then divorce and seek refuge in another loveless marriage, this time to a Swiss businessman.         But it would have taken a remarkable visionary to have imagined Miss Bancroft's later life as an accomplished spy, a woman with such penetrating intelligence, infallible intuition and boundless verve -- not to mention legs that rarely failed to draw a second glance -- that her intellectual, emotional or romantic conquests included Carl Jung, Woody Allen and Henry R. Luce.         To Jung, the psychologist who became her confidant during her years in Switzerland, her appeal was textbook obvious. In his scheme of things she was an extroverted intuitive, one who had experienced such fierce inter-family battles for her affections as a child that power had become her natural element. She had such an instinctive knack for wielding it, he told her, that men seeking or holding power would cherish her advice, as indeed they did.         Her relationships were often platonic, apparently -- and surprisingly -- including even her postwar fling in New York with Luce, the Time Inc. founder and a legendary ladies' man.         But as her own 1983 book, ''Autobiography of a Spy,'' makes explicit, her wartime romance with Allen Dulles, the American spymaster who laid the groundwork for the Central Intelligence Agency with his brilliant successes in Switzerland in World War II, was as torrid as they come.         At the time, Miss Bancroft's second marriage was beginning to unravel, and Mr. Dulles, whose wife was in the United States, was looking for recruits to interview the hundreds of refugees, adventurers and spies who poured into officially neutral Switzerland from every corner of wartime Europe.         Impressed with the insightful analyses of German articles and speeches she had prepared for one of his associates, he sought her out, quickly concluding that she would be an ideal operative, and more.         ''It should work out very well,'' he blurted out on their second meeting. ''We can let the work cover the romance -- and the romance cover the work.'' The remark might have seemed startling considering that the subject of romance had not been mentioned, but Mr. Dulles was as perceptive as his recruit. The logic appealed to her, and so did he.         In what became a regular routine, she would help him prepare his legendary nightly telephone reports to Washington at his home in Bern, and then the two would engage in what she called ''a bit of dalliance.''         As a spy, she interviewed and sized up visitors from Germany and German-occupied territory, sometimes with startling results. One contact  provided the first inkling that a previously unknown figure named Joseph Broz had become the man to deal with in Yugoslavia, where he was known as Tito.         When her German maid's brother-in-law wrote from the Russian front asking for an aluminum spoon, noting that his wife had told him none was available in Germany, she picked up a critical clue about the war's effects on German production.         By far her most important work was with Hans Bernd Gisevius, a top officer of German military intelligence, who was not only a key figure in a vast plot to kill Hitler and set up a civilian democracy but who, well in advance of what turned out to be a bungled assassination attempt on July 20, 1944, had supplied a manuscript detailing the conspiracy.         Miss Bancroft was entrusted with translating the manuscript into English (Gisevius wanted it published immediately after the coup), but her real job was to make sure he was not a double agent (she concluded he was not) and then to elicit and pass on the detailed information he supplied about the day-to-day shifts of power and strategy within the German Government.         After the war, her daughter said, Miss Bancroft settled in New York, wrote a few novels, lectured on Jung, became active in local Democratic politics, became friends with Woody Allen and became Luce's confidant.         When her daughter, Mary Jane, married Horace Taft, the son of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the wedding pictures were published in Life, -- ''a present from Luce,'' Mrs. Taft said.         In addition to her daughter, of Atlanta, Miss Bancroft is survived by 6 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Margaret Halsey, author of the 1938 best seller ''With Malice Toward Some,'' which poked fun at English customs and mores, died on Tuesday at the Nathan Miller Nursing Home in White Plains. She was 86.         In her time, Ms. Halsey, a witty writer with an acute social concern, was compared to Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken. She came of age in an era when often the best job a well-educated graduate of a women's college could get was a secretarial position in publishing.         She was born in Yonkers, the daughter of Reinhold Halsey, deputy superintendent of buildings for New York City public schools. She attended Skidmore College.         In 1933, she became secretary to  the author and editor Max Eastman, who got her an entry-level job at Simon & Schuster in Manhattan.         In 1935, she married Henry Simon, an assistant professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia University and the brother of the publisher Richard L. Simon.         The newlyweds went to live in Devon, England, where Mr. Simon was on a teaching exchange. Ms. Halsey's letters home complaining of the eccentricities of English people, their food and the drudgery of their life, caught the attention of her brother-in-law, who commissioned her to write what became ''With Malice Toward Some.''         It included digressions on such subjects as English pie crust: ''It is possible to eat English pie crust, whatever you may think at first. The English eat it, and when they stand up and walk away, they are hardly bent over at all.'' On the subject of English shoes, Ms. Halsey wrote: ''Englishwomen's shoes look as if they had been made by someone who had often heard shoes described but had never seen any.'' The book sold 600,000 copies.         In 1944 Ms. Halsey was divorced from Mr. Simon. That year, she published ''Some of My Best Friends Are Soldiers,'' which she called ''a sort of novel'' about race relations in America. The book, an account of her work at the Stage Door Canteen in Times Square, was the beginning of a lifelong preoccupation with the subject of race.         ''Color Blind: A White Woman Looks at the Negro,'' followed in 1946. In the book, Ms. Halsey wrote that a need for a cheap labor supply and a fear of blacks' sexuality were at the heart of racism. Margaret Mead called the book ''straightforward, courageous and delightful.'' It was banned from schools in Georgia.         In ''The Pseudo-Ethic: A Speculation on American Politics and Morals'' in the late 60's, Ms. Halsey turned her attentions to a defense of Alger Hiss.         During the 1950's and 60's, her life took a darker course, and she wrote about her problems in ''No Laughing Matter: The Autobiography of a WASP'' (1977). She struggled with alcoholism and agoraphobia. Her only child, Deborah, nearly died from a brain tumor, and she was estranged from her parents. In 1969, her second marriage, to Milton R. Stern, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Deborah Halsey Stern, of White Plains.       
         Lucy Kroll, a longtime New York talent agent whose clients ranged  from Carl Sandburg to James Earl Jones to Norman Mailer, died on Friday at her home in Glendale, Mass. She was 87 and had moved to the Berkshires eight years ago.         She sold her Lucy Kroll Agency in late 1994 to Barbara Hogenson, an associate, but had kept a residence and office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan until last spring.         In 1994 she also gave the Library of Congress 110 boxes brimming with thousands of letters, manuscripts, contracts and other memorabilia.         The list of American greats and near-greats whose paths she crossed also included Lillian Gish, Ben Hecht, William Schuman, Martha Graham, Carl Sagan, Ossie Davis and Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. They ranged, she said, ''from dancers to jugglers,'' and many of them became her friends.         She represented Sandburg for 10 years until his death in 1967 and then tended to the Sandburg Trust for television, film and the stage. She was co-producer of a two-hour special for the Public Broadcasting System on his 100th anniversary in 1978 and organized a tour of ''The World of Carl Sandburg,'' a theatrical presentation of his writings adapted by Norman Corwin and starring Bette Davis and Gary Merrill.         She was also associated with the television version of the program, produced by her former husband, Nathan Kroll, and starring two of her clients, Fritz Weaver and Uta Hagen. In addition she was involved with a six-part mini-series of Sandburg's ''Lincoln,'' and with the award-winning PBS film ''Carl Sandburg -- Echoes and Silences,'' as well as the book ''Carl Sandburg: A Biography'' by Penelope Niven, another client.         She represented James Earl Jones for more than 40 years and looked after the interests of Alex Haley for the television series ''Roots,'' in which Mr. Jones played the part of Mr. Haley.         She also represented the playwright Horton Foote for half a century and helped establish a number of regional theaters.         During an association with the choreographer Martha Graham, she discovered that Ms. Graham had squirreled away some 50 stenographer's books of notes without ever writing an autobiography. She persuaded Ms. Graham to cooperate in their publication in the form of ''The Notebooks of Martha Graham.''         She was born Lucy Rosengardt in Brooklyn and graduated from Hunter College in 1933. She earned a master's degree in 1935 at the School for Stage while training for the classical ballet.         After her marriage to Mr. Kroll in 1939, she worked as a story analyst at the Warner Brothers studio in Burbank, Calif. She was a founder of the Hollywood Theater Alliance and the Hollywood Music Alliance.         In 1945 she returned East to open a New York office for the Sam Jaffe Agency of California. She found that the work as a literary and talent agent suited her so well that she took over the business in 1947 and turned it into the Lucy Kroll Agency.         Her marriage to Mr. Kroll, a producer-director and a resident of Tarrytown, ended in divorce in 1974. She is survived by a son, Stephen R., of Adamant, Vt.       
         Lenore LoPresti, a singer, actress and interior decorator, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 69 and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, said her son, Jonathan.         Born in New York, she attended the Ethical Culture School, Fieldston and the University of Iowa and studied at the drama workshop of the New School for Social Research and the Actors Studio. As a young woman, she had careers as both a singer and an actress and worked for a time in production at NBC Television.         Her marriage to Richard LoPresti ended in divorce. Besides her son, she is survived by a brother, Julian Sayer of Stamford, Conn.       
         Laura Nyro, the New York-born singer and songwriter whose impassioned, iconoclastic music exploded pop song conventions in a feverish search for emotional truth, died on Tuesday at her home in Danbury, Conn. She was 49.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Elizabeth Rush, her business representative.         Along with Joni Mitchell, Ms. Nyro (pronounced Nero) was a pioneer in the confessional, free-form school of songwriting that grew out of 1960's folk music, especially the work of Bob Dylan. A trained pianist, she had a kaleidoscopic musical sensibility that fused elements of folk, soul, gospel and Broadway tradition into intensely introspective songs that transcended easy stylistic categorization.         With her uninhibited, note-bending vocal wail, she also helped introduce the rhythm-and-blues-influenced style known as ''blue-eyed soul,'' so named because it was popularized by white singers imitating black role models. And her live concerts were fervent affairs in which the dark-haired, dark-eyed singer, exotically gowned and surrounded by roses, performed with a transported intensity.         As a recording artist, Ms. Nyro never had a gold album or a hit single, but many of her songs were hits for others. And her albums, especially her 1968 song suite ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession'' (Columbia), a sometimes impenetrable mosaic of fragments, reflections and fantasies with a Southern gospel feel,  was one of the most influential pop recordings of the late 1960's. Among the many artists inspired by Ms. Nyro's eclecticism and poetic sensibility were Rickie Lee Jones, Kate Bush, Wendy Waldman, Jane Siberry, Teena Marie, Suzanne Vega,  Toni Childs, Tori Amos and Paula Cole.         Among Ms. Nyro's biggest hits for others were the songs ''And When I Die'' (recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary and Blood, Sweat and Tears),  ''Wedding Bell Blues'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Sweet Blindness'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Stoned Soul Picnic'' (the Fifth Dimension), ''Eli's Coming'' (Three Dog Night) and ''Stoney End'' (Barbra Streisand).         Ms. Nyro was born Laura Nigro in the Bronx on Oct. 18, 1947. Her father was a jazz trumpeter who practiced for hours at home. An undisciplined child prodigy, Ms. Nyro began writing songs at age 8 and later attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. As a teen-ager she experimented with psychedelic drugs, absorbed musical influences as far-ranging as Bob Dylan, John Coltrane and Debussy, and at 18 made her  first extended club appearance at the Hungry i coffeehouse in San Francisco.         In 1966, Verve/Folkways released her debut album, ''More Than a New Discovery,'' a remarkably sophisticated collection of original songs that Columbia later purchased and reissued in 1973 as ''The First Songs.'' Widely admired, it led to an invitation to perform at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, where her introspective music proved so out of place amid the high-powered rock of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin that she was shouted off the stage.         Within the year, however, several of Ms. Nyro's songs had become hits for others, and she was signed by Columbia. In March 1968, the label released ''Eli and the Thirteenth Confession,'' her autobiographical album about a young woman's spiritual journey from childhood to maturity. With its abrupt changes of tempo and style and its fiercely emotional singing, the record was unlike anything that had been heard in pop music, and it laid the groundwork for a female-dominated genre of quirky, reflective songwriting that continues to this day.         On her next two albums, ''New York Tendaberry'' (1969) and ''Christmas and the Beads of Sweat'' (1970), Ms. Nyro retreated somewhat from the boundary-breaking experimentalism of ''Eli'' and settled into her characteristic style, which remained eclectic but had its strongest roots in the Philadelphia pop-soul sound of songwriters like Thom Bell, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, and Todd Rundgren. Her 1971 album, ''Gonna Take a Miracle,'' a collaboration with the rhythm-and-blues group LaBelle, was a tribute to New York street music of an earlier era that featured  jubilant remakes of old doo-wop and Motown favorites.         Never comfortable in the limelight, Ms. Nyro married and retreated from the music business to lead a secluded life for the next three years in a fishing village in Massachusetts. After the marriage ended in divorce, she returned to recording, putting out ''Smile'' (1976), her first album in four years. Here, and in her later  Columbia albums, ''Nested'' (1978), ''Mother's Spiritual'' (1984) and ''Walk the Dog and Light the Light'' (1993), her songs gave increasingly direct expression to the pantheism that had always lurked in her writing. But if her later songs exalted pacifism, feminism, motherhood and animal rights, the emotional turmoil of old was never far from the surface.         Ms. Nyro personally selected all 34 of the songs on a recently released two-disk retrospective of her work, ''The Best of Laura Nyro: Stoned Soul Picnic'' (Columbia/Legacy).         She is survived by a son, Gil Bianchini, and her companion, Maria Desiderio.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Carol Botwin, the author and social critic whose lively and exhaustive writings on sex and infidelity made her one of the leading sexologists of her generation, died yesterday at her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said Wilfred Koplowitz, her longtime companion.         With the publication of her first book, ''Sex and the Teenage Girl,'' in 1972, Ms. Botwin became a respected authority on the sexual attitudes and proclivities of young women.         She presented a broader view of the subject in subsequent books on sex and marriage and in columns she wrote for This Week and Girl Talk magazines in the 1960's and early 1970's. During the 1980's, she wrote an advice column for New Woman and Woman magazines.         Known for her no-nonsense advice and compassionate irreverence, Ms. Botwin managed to transcend gender and age in her writing. Her most popular books dealt with male and female infidelity and have been translated into more than a dozen languages.         Ms. Botwin's book ''The Love Crisis: Hit and Run Lovers, Jugglers, Sexual Stingies, Kinkies and Other Typical Men Today'' has been described as a field guide for dealing with the contemporary male and was the precursor to such 1990's best sellers as ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.''         Ms. Botwin said the book was based on the personal pain she experienced after her first marriage ended in divorce. Despite her own failed marriage, she counseled married couples on how to achieve personal and sexual fulfillment within their marriages.         ''Her advice was never negative,'' said Barbara Lowenstein, her agent of 20 years. ''Her voice registered with all women, no matter what their age.''         Her most recent book, ''Tempted Women: The Passions, Perils and Agonies of Female Infidelity,'' published in 1994 by William Morrow, was viewed by experts on sex and sexuality as one of the most comprehensive surveys since Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey's studies in 1953. Drawing on hundreds of letters from women who sought her advice and hundreds of interviews conducted over a three-year-period, Ms. Botwin found that 40 percent of married women were going outside their marriages for emotional and physical attention that they were not receiving at home.         The book was a sequel to ''Men Who Can't Be Faithful,'' which sparked heated debate on the talk show circuit after it was reported that 60 to 75 percent of American men cheated at least once in their married lives.         The former Carol Dariff was born in the Bronx and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from New York University, followed by graduate studies at Columbia University. She married Edward Botwin, a real estate broker. They were divorced in 1983.         At the time of her death, Ms. Botwin, who was diagnosed with cancer in October 1994, was preparing to write a book on the disease and her battle to overcome it, according to Mr. Koplowitz.         Besides Mr. Koplowitz, she is survived by a son, William, and a daughter, Alexandra, both of New York City, and a sister, Lillian Katell of Carlsbad, Calif.       
         Helene-Diane Shulman Kravis Ruger, an interior designer known professionally as Hedi Kravis, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Ms. Kravis, who maintained homes in Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y., was 49.         The cause was cancer, her son, Robert S. Kravis, said.         With her friend Elissa Cullman, known as Ellie, Ms. Kravis was a founding partner in 1984 of the Manhattan decorating firm of Cullman & Kravis.         They were among a new breed of interior designer -- young, chic, energetic and enterprising -- who were part of the society they designed for.         Their natural habitats were the Upper East Side and summer homes in the country. And instead of serving long apprenticeships with well-known decorators or taking courses in interior design, these women began by decorating their own apartments, their husbands' offices and their friends' country retreats.         For their clients, they enhanced the kind of settings they knew well -- spacious living rooms for parties, paneled libraries for leisure, tables hospitable to guests numbered in the dozens and richly canopied beds for slumber.         ''If you can really organize a household, you can do anything,'' Ms. Kravis said in an interview in 1987.         For one assignment, Ms. Kravis and her clients donned sunglasses and sun hats in the first week in January to imagine what summer would be like at a sprawling stucco and shingle house of 8,500 square feet on a site overlooking the Atlantic in East Hampton, L.I., where she had only six months to effect a transformation.         ''We imagined the landscaping and the not-yet-built tennis court,'' Ms. Kravis said, ''and thought what it might be like to walk through the house and out to play tennis.''         In 1987, Mrs. Cullman traced the origins of the firm to a movie script that she and Ms. Kravis showed to Stanley Jaffe, a film producer and old friend. ''His reaction was that we were talented, but could we help him refurbish his house in the country and pull his different homes together?'' she said. ''We were obsessive. We went down to the last details -- matchbook covers and guest towels.''         Both women married young, bore children, traveled, entertained, served on the boards of charities and collected antique English furniture, Chinese porcelain, American folk paintings and modern art.         Ms. Kravis, whose father, Bernard Shulman, was a psychiatrist, was born and reared in Brooklyn. She graduated from Finch College in 1969 and studied English at Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         She was a member of the board of the Irvington Institute for Medical Research and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. She also worked on behalf of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the American Jewish Committee.         Her marriage to Henry Kravis, the leveraged-buyout specialist, ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to J. Thompson Ruger, an executive of Sturm, Ruger & Company, manufacturers of firearms, was ended by his death in 1993.         In addition to her son, Ms. Kravis is survived by a daughter, Kimberly R. Kravis, and a sister, Sharon Beckerman, all of Manhattan.       
         Martha Duffy, a former senior editor in charge of coverage of the performing arts for Time magazine, died yesterday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, James Duffy.         Mrs. Duffy, one of the first women to become a senior editor at the magazine, held that post from 1974 to 1989. She joined Time in 1960 and was a researcher and then a reporter,  contributing editor and associate editor before her promotion in 1974.         She was a senior writer specializing in culture and entertainment news from 1989 until her death. She was also Time's longtime dance critic and was known as a mentor for young writers.         Mrs. Duffy was promoted to senior editor while Henry Grunwald was Time's chief editor. In his memoir, ''One Man's America'' (1997), he described Mrs. Duffy as ''one of Time's outstanding cultural editors.''         Early in her career, working on a cover story about the reclusive author J. D. Salinger, she distinguished herself by managing to trail him to a New Hampshire post office. She asked if they could talk, but he fled.         Among the writers to whom she was a mentor was Frank Rich, who was a film and television critic for Time from 1977 to 1980 and is now an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. ''She could improve any piece of copy, but she ultimately taught you how to improve your own copy,'' he recalled yesterday. ''She had a brain like steel.''         Mrs. Duffy was born Martha Murphy in Boston and graduated in 1957 from Radcliffe College. An early marriage, to David McDowell, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Anne Murphy of Manhattan.       
         Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious, a Chicago lawyer who held high posts in the Nixon and Bush Administrations, was active in the civil rights movement and was on the boards of major corporations, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 75.         The cause of death was breast cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a Republican, was known as Jewel S. Lafontant when she served in the Nixon and Bush Administrations. Prior to that, President Richard M. Nixon had appointed her to the Justice Department as Deputy Solicitor General -- the first woman and the first black person to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office.  She held that post from 1973 to 1975. Under President George Bush, from 1989 to 1993, she was in the State Department with the concurrent titles of ambassador-at-large and coordinator of refugee affairs.         In the civil rights field, she was a founding member of the Congress of Racial Equality, an officer of the Chicago chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. During the early 1940's, The Chicago Sun-Times reported yesterday, ''She brought change to the city by participating in sit-ins at Loop restaurants.'' In a 1991 interview, she recalled, ''Often we were spat upon and physically abused.''         Times changed, and from 1965 to 1967 she was on the President's Council on Minority Business Enterprise. In the early 1970's Ebony magazine named her one of the 100 most influential black Americans.         The corporate boards she was on over the years included those of the Mobil Corporation, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Trans World Airlines, Revlon, Inc., Harte-Hanks Communications, the Hanes Corporation and the Bendix Corporation         During her career, she was also a director of nonprofit institutions including Oberlin College, Howard University and Tuskegee Institute. And she received numerous awards and honorary degrees.         At her death she was a partner in the Chicago law firm of Holleb & Coff, which she joined in 1993. Her law practice, in her years there, was concentrated in the areas of corporate law, labor and employment law, and governmental and international relations.         Jewel Stradford was born in Chicago, the daughter of C. Francis Stradford -- a lawyer -- and Aida Arabella Cartera, and grew up there. She graduated in 1943 from Oberlin College and received a law degree in 1946 from the University of Chicago.         But afterward, The Sun-Times reported, she could not obtain office space, no major white law firm would employ her, and the Chigago Bar Association would not admit her as a member. In 1947, she went to work in the legal aid bureau of a charitable organization, before going on to work for a succession of Chicago law firms and doing much trial work.         During the Eisenhower Administration, from 1955 to 1958, she served as assistant United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1960, she seconded the nomination of Mr. Nixon as Republican candidate for President, but he was defeated by John F. Kennedy.         As the Bush Administration's coordinator for refugee affairs, she dealt with a staggering variety of problems. In 1989, when Moscow was permitting record numbers of Soviet Jews and Pentecostals to leave its soil, she declared that the Bush Adminstration wanted to ''get control over the flow'' of emigres. In 1990, she went to London and reaffirmed a Bush Administration pledge that the United States would help to settle half of all new Vietnamese boat people -- refugees who fled their country by sea and mostly went to camps in the British crown colony of Hong Kong.         In the same year, she went to the African nation of Malawi, which had been flooded with refugees from a civil war in neighboring Mozambique.         Her 1946 marriage to John Rogers ended in divorce in 1961. Later that year she married H. Ernest Lafontant, and he died in 1976.         She is survived by her husband of seven years, Naguib S. Mankarious; a son, John W. Rogers Jr. of Chicago, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  June 13, 1997, Friday         The obituary of Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious on June 3 referred incorrectly to a distinction she attained when she became Deputy Solicitor General of the United States in 1973. While she was the first woman to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office, she was not the highest-ranking black staff member. That was Thurgood Marshall, who became Solicitor General in 1965.       
         Denise Browne Hare, who photographed many leading painters and sculptors of the mid-20th century, died on Wednesday at Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn. She was 73 and lived in Amenia, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said her son Morgan Hare.         Ms. Hare was born in Manhattan. During World War II, she worked as an analyst for Army Intelligence in Washington.         Ms. Hare and her first husband, Edmund Delaney, moved to New York City in the 1940's, where she became friends with artists including Mark Rothko. After her divorce from Mr. Delaney, she married the sculptor David Hare in 1962, and the Hare household became a favorite haunt of still other artists.         Her photographs of Joseph Cornell and Philip Guston appeared in books by Dore Ashton in 1974 and 1976.         Ms. Hare's marriage ended in divorce in 1986.         In addition to her son Morgan of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Nick Delaney of Seattle; a daughter, Topher Delaney of San Francisco; two sisters, Eliane Koevas of Chester, Conn., and Jenny de Kergolay of Paris, and six grandchildren.       
         Mathilda, the Dowager Duchess of Argyll, died Friday at the American Hospital in Paris. She was 70 and had homes in Scotland and Paris.         Lord Colin Campbell, her stepson, said she died of a stroke.         The Duchess was the widow of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll and the 25th chief of Clan Campbell, who died in 1973. They were married in 1963 only months after the Duke divorced his third wife, Margaret, in one of Scotland's most celebrated divorce cases.         The Duchess was born Mathilda Coster Mortimer in 1925, the daughter of Stanley and Mathilda Mortimer of Litchfield, Conn. Her parents were divorced shortly after her birth and she was brought up by her grandmother in Paris.         During World War II, the Duchess studied philosophy at Radcliffe College. She returned to Europe in 1945 and married Clemens Heller, who had founded the Seminar of American Studies, a summer school in Salzburg, Austria. They were divorced in 1962.         After her marriage to the Duke, they lived in the Inverary Castle, a storybook feudal bastion, near Loch Fyne.         In the early 1990's, the Duchess began working on an autobiography. She said she later decided to stop because she found it distasteful to write about her experiences during the Duke's divorce case.         Some years earlier, she took up photography and had an exhibit of her pictures in New York. She also wrote ''Orion,'' a mystical odyssey, which she published at her own expense.         In addition to Lord Colin Campbell, she is survived by two sons, Dr. Yvan Heller of Geneva and Dr. Michael Heller of Lausanne, Switzerland; a stepson, the Duke of Argyll, and a stepdaughter, Lady Jeanne Campbell of New York.       
         Evelyn Fortune Bartlett, an art patron who was a major benefactor of the Art Institute of Chicago, died on Tuesday at her home in Beverly, Mass. She was 109.         Alert until a few weeks ago, Mrs. Bartlett was also an ardent gardener and farmer, something of an eccentric and a master of detail. In the lush gardens she cultivated at Bonnet House, a 35-acre estate in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., she could recount how and where every plant, ornament and tile was bought and installed. She grew many varieties of orchids, put black and white swans in the estate's ponds and bought 30 to 40 monkeys for its trees.         Mrs. Bartlett was equally particular with her farm in Essex, Mass., which was called Bothways. Besides the usual cows, sheep and chickens, it was also home to two llamas and an emu. For visitors, she would recite various species she raised. But she would also serve many of them, along with the vegetables she grew, for lunch. Asked if eating the animals bothered her, she replied, ''I run a farm, not a zoo.''         Described as a small, dainty woman with a stern face, she was said to be private but invariably gracious. ''She was completely representative of another age, the age of manners,'' said Courtney Graham Donnell, an associate curator at the Art Institute. ''I had lunch with her three times at her house in Beverly, and we never ate off the same china.'' Before each lunch, there would be sherry by the fire.         Mrs. Bartlett was the daughter of William Fortune, who for many years was president of the Indianapolis Telephone Company as well as other telephone companies and a director of Eli Lilly and Company. Her first marriage was to Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical concern's founder, from whom she was divorced around 1927.         She married Frederick Clay Bartlett, a Chicago-born artist, architect and patron of the arts, in 1931. Shortly thereafter she took up painting, moving quickly from watercolors to oils and developing her own style. Her pictures -- vividly colored portraits, still lifes and flower paintings, bore little resemblance to her husband's murals, landscapes and figurative works, executed in muted tones.         Mr. Bartlett and his previous wife, Helen Birch, had been among the first Americans to collect Post-Impressionist works, assembling a priceless collection of paintings by Cezanne, Picasso, van Gogh, Matisse and Seurat that went to the Art Institute upon Helen Birch Bartlett's death in 1925.         The collection included Seurat's legendary ''Sunday Afternoon on La Grand Jatte.'' After Mr. Bartlett died in 1956, Evelyn Bartlett donated money to construct a gallery named after him and to provide for the presentation and preservation of those paintings, known as the Helen Birch Bartlett collection.         A later marriage to Daniel Huger ended in divorce in 1969.         Mrs. Bartlett donated many paintings and sculptures to the Art Institute. Although she did not live for very long in Chicago, her interest in the city's art scene continued. When works in the galleries she supported were rehung six years ago, she traveled to Chicago to see them. At her death, she was an honorary governing member, life trustee, sustaining fellow and member of the Old Masters Society of the Art Institute.         No immediate family members survive, a spokesman for the Art Institute said. Mrs. Bartlett bequeathed Bothways, the farm in Essex, to the Massachusetts Trustees of Reservations, a preservation organization, and Whitehall, her home in Beverly, to the Beverly Hospital. Bonnet House was turned into a museum in Fort Lauderdale several years ago, but she retained the right to live there and spent each winter on the estate.         In 1982, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington organized a retrospective exhibition of her work and Mr. Bartlett's that also traveled to the Art Institute. Feted among friends at a gala dinner in the gallery in Chicago, Mrs. Bartlett seemed delighted but made no speech. ''She was,'' Ms. Donnell said, ''much too shy for that.''         Correction:  July 4, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the art patron Evelyn Fortune Bartlett yesterday misidentified her first husband, Eli Lilly. He was the grandson and namesake of the founder of Eli Lilly & Company, not the founder.       
         Frances Keene, a writer, translator and educator who specialized in the Romance languages, died on June 26 at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 83 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her son Adriano Valentino.         Ms. Keene's translations from the Italian included works by Cesare Pavese and Luigi Pirandello. She also edited an anthology of writings by anti-Fascist Italians and exiles, ''Neither Liberty Nor Bread'' (1940).         As an editor at Ridge Press, Ms. Keene helped develop children's books for other companies. These included the Double-Language Books for Doubleday, Fast Books and Look-and-Do Activity Books for Rand McNally and paperbacks for the Scholastic Book Series. She was also the editor of the juvenile books program for Macmillan and worked with such authors as Maurice Sendak and Hilary Knight.         She wrote a number of books for young readers, using the pen name Alex Rider, and reviewed books for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation and other publications.         Ms. Keene was born in Boston and was a graduate of Smith College. She received a master's degree in Italian literature from Columbia University. During World War II, she worked with the Office of War Information. In later years she was a consultant for Unesco's multilingual books and was a founder of the Society of Children's Book Writers.         Her three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son Adriano, of East Hampton, she is survived by two other sons, Alexander Ratensky of Tampa, Fla., and Luca Valentino of New York City; a daughter, Dr. Antonia Meltzoff of La Jolla, Calif., and a grandchild.       
         Alexandra Danilova, an internationally popular ballet star known for her vivacity and theatrical flair, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Beloved by audiences in a performing career that extended from the Imperial Russian Ballet of St. Petersburg to Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes of the 1920's and the various Ballets Russes companies that succeeded it, Miss Danilova was also a noted teacher and for many years a faculty member of the School of American Ballet, the New York City Ballet's school.         She was known to friends by the nickname Choura, and admired for her Champagne-like sparkle and a stage presence so intense that she could command attention even when she was not moving. With her heart-shaped face and dark brown hair, she was striking to behold. She was also celebrated for possessing what were considered the most beautiful -- and photogenic -- legs in ballet. Lincoln Kirstein, the New York City Ballet's director, once called them ''legs like luminous wax.''         Yet Miss Danilova did more than personify glamour. Extraordinarily versatile, she danced roles that ranged from the passionate Swan Queen in ''Swan Lake'' to the mischievous Swanilda in ''Coppelia'' and the worldly heroines of Leonide Massine's balletic comedies, ''Le Beau Danube'' and ''Gaite Parisienne.'' Although she particularly enjoyed dramatic roles, she also danced abstract ballets. George Balanchine, her schoolmate from St. Petersburg, created ''Danses Concertantes'' in 1944 for her and for Frederic Franklin, the English-born dancer who was her partner at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from the late 1930's through the 50's.         She appeared in many experimental productions, including, in the Soviet Union, Fyodor Lopukhov's ''Dance Symphony'' of 1923, among the first abstract symphonic ballets. Artistically inquisitive, Miss Danilova once said: ''I have been so lucky. All my life I have worked with the avant-garde. That developed me enormously as an artist, much more than if I had danced just 'Swan Lake' and 'Giselle.' ''         She was born in Peterhof, Russia, near St. Petersburg, on Nov. 20, 1903, and orphaned when she was a small child. She was brought up by relatives and foster parents. When they discovered that the little girl loved to dance, they wondered if there might be a career in ballet for her, and she was accepted by the Imperial Ballet School in 1911. In 1920, she entered the Maryinsky Ballet, the company now known as the Kirov Ballet.         As a young dancer, she was caught up in the artistic ferment after the Bolshevik Revolution. Not only did she appear in the experiments of Lopukhov, but she also became a friend of Balanchine, at that time an experimental young choreographer. Along with several other dancers, she and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924 on what was intended to be a tour of Western Europe. But that same year, she and Balanchine were accepted by Diaghilev: Miss Danilova as a dancer, Balanchine as a choreographer.         Until 1931, she and Balanchine lived together as husband and wife, although they were never married. Balanchine was still officially married to another dancer, Tamara Geva, and he told Miss Danilova that because his marriage papers had been left behind in Russia, he feared it might be difficult to arrange a legal separation.         When Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Danilova said she felt as if the ground had collapsed beneath her feet. A few years later, however, she danced with the Ballets Russes, which Col. W. de Basil organized in 1933 as a successor to the Diaghilev company. In 1938, she became prima ballerina of a rival company, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, in part because its resident choreographer was Massine, whom she admired only slightly less than Balanchine. The coming of World War II turned the Ballet Russe into an American company and, often partnered by Mr. Franklin, she toured across the country until the early 1950's, appearing in the classics, in ballets by Massine and in works by other choreographers, including Balanchine.         Miss Danilova, who became an American citizen in 1946, was twice married, to Giuseppe Massera in 1934 and to Casimir Kokitch in 1941. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Miss Danilova said in ''Choura,'' her autobiography, which was published in 1986: ''I sacrificed marriage, children and country to be a ballerina, and there was never any misunderstanding on my part: I knew the price.''         She also wrote, ''In a way I regard American audiences as my children, because I helped to educate them.''         Many dancegoers who saw her with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo would agree to that. Miss Danilova gained the reputation of being an artist who was never slack and who gave one-night appearances in tiny villages the same loving care that she bestowed upon seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.         ''I never danced for an audience that I thought was unworthy of my performance,'' she once declared. She said she believed that a ballerina should always be glamorous, onstage or off. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''Every woman has an image -- mother, princess, ballerina -- that she must uphold. I was privileged to be a ballerina and I, therefore, had a duty to my audience. They must never be disappointed in me.''         Miss Danilova was often in demand as a guest teacher around the country. She also coached works from the classical repertory, and in 1974, she and Balanchine staged ''Coppelia'' for the New York City Ballet. She appeared on Broadway in ''Song of Norway'' in 1944 and ''Oh, Captain'' in 1958 and in the movie ''The Turning Point'' in 1976. In 1958, she received the Capezio Award.         No immediate family members survive. A funeral service for Miss Danilova will be held at 5 P.M. on Thursday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.         Although she was long reluctant to return to Russia, Lewis Ufland, her former manager, said yesterday that Miss Danilova did go back several years ago. She visited St. Petersburg as part of the trip, and was able to attend graduation performances at the Kirov School, the former Imperial Ballet School she had attended as a child. The faculty enthusiastically welcomed her as one of that institution's greatest alumnae.       
         The death at 36 of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash in Paris brought to a tragic close the life of a woman who had gone from being a shy young society girl to one of the world's most glamorous women.         Her marriage to Prince Charles, heir to the British throne and 12 years her senior, on July 29, 1981, was one of those events that people remember as a timepost in their own lives, a moment of old fashioned romance and royal splendor seldom seen in this century. Fifteen million people in Britain alone watched it on television.         The unraveling of that marriage was just as public, with the extraordinary occurrence of candid television interviews by the two partners about their separate adulteries and the descent of the young Princess into eating disorders and suicide attempts.         Though the marriage ended officially with their divorce a year ago Aug. 28, the rivalry for public attention and approval continued until her death. This year the Princess had taken highly publicized trips to former war zones like Angola to conduct her high-profile campaign against landmines, and had in recent weeks posed knowingly on Mediterranean holidays with her friend, Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, 42, in an apparent effort to show the world that the once troubled young woman had found personal happiness.         Prince Charles, for his part, held the first photo calls at his vacation home in Balmoral since the early days of his marriage, appearing with the couple's two sons, William, 15, the next heir to the throne, and Harry, 13. It was a competition conducted by photo opportunity, and in the Princess's case turned a liability she often complained about, the constant attention of paparazzi, into an asset.         Lady Diana Spencer was born on July 1, 1961, Sandringham, Norfolk, and was only 19 years old when Charles proposed. Her son William was born in June, 1982, providing promised continuity to the crown and making her the mother of a king-to-be.         By 1986 the first press stories about cracks in the marriage appeared, at a time, a biography of the Princess has said, when Charles had resumed his relationship with his married friend Camilla Parker Bowles.         That biography ''Diana: Her True Story,'' by Andrew Morton, said she then started dating a cavalry officer, James Hewitt, conducting an affair that lasted four years and which she later said had hurt her.         The royal couple had few common interests. Charles loved horses, his garden and traditional architecture; she loved buying clothes, listening to pop music on her Walkman and gossiping on the telephone.         Once a girl in frilly modest-maiden dresses and a modified bowl haircut, she had become a fashionplate with annual expenses of more than $1.2 million, a woman whose every style change influenced the way women around the well dressed world appeared. Just this past June, 80 of her dresses were auctioned off for charity at Christie's in New York, promoted in a lavish catalogue shot by Lord Snowden, the former husband of Princess Margaret.         The couple separated in 1992, and in November 1995, Diana gave her explosive interview to the BBC confessing her own adultery, her anger at the palace and her feeling that Charles would not be a good King. It became widely reported that her wish was that Charles renounce his right to the crown, passing it on to their son William, known to the British public as Wills.         In the divorce she had to give up the honorific Her Royal Highness, the title that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats, but was able to keep the title Princess of Wales. She obtained lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600,000 a year to maintain her offices. She also got the right to keep her five-bedroom, four-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace.       
         Shirley Clarke, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, a champion of independent filmmaking and a missionary for video as a force in communications, died on Tuesday at the Palliative Care Center of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. She was 77 and lived in Carlisle, Mass.         Her sister Elaine Dundy, the novelist and biographer, said Miss Clarke entered the center, a hospice, after a stroke two weeks ago. She also suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         As a filmmaker, Miss Clarke was probably best known for the three pictures she made between 1960 and 1963. ''The Connection,'' filmed in cinema verite style in 1960 and taken from Jack Gelber's Off Broadway play, was a frank study of drug addiction that was banned on grounds of obscenity by the motion picture division of the New York State Board of Regents.         Her 1962 documentary, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' a portrait of the poet, won an Oscar.         Her gritty 1963 film, ''The Cool World,'' adapted from a novel by Warren Miller and filmed on the streets of Harlem, tracked the life of a young man who rises briefly to the leadership of a juvenile gang.         ''Right now,'' Miss Clarke said in 1962, ''I'm revolting against the conventions of movies. Who says a film has to cost a million dollars and be safe and innocuous enough to satisfy every 12-year-old in America?''         In 1962 Miss Clarke and the filmmaker and critic Jonas Mekas founded the Film-Makers Cooperative, a nonprofit company for the distribution of independent films.         ''There must be 40 or 50 others like me in the country, with a desire for self-expression and no urge to move to Hollywood and make soap opera,'' Miss Clarke said.         ''We're creating a movie equivalent of Off Broadway, fresh and experimental and personal. The lovely thing is that I'm alive at just the time when I can do this.''         In 1967, Miss Clarke attracted attention with the release of ''Portrait of Jason,'' filmed during a single 12-hour session in her Manhattan apartment. The documentary, shown at the New York Film Festival, was a 105-minute interview with a gay black male prostitute.         ''The result, I'm convinced, is a portrait of a guy who is both a genius and a bore,'' she said.         By the 1970's, Miss Clarke was turning to video. ''Videotape is going to teach Americans to play with each other,'' she said then. ''The fight of the 1980's will be the battle for access to communications media.''         Released in 1986, her final movie, ''Ornette: Made in America,'' a portrait of the great modern jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman, mixed film and video.         From 1975 to 1983, Miss Clarke was a professor of film at the University of California at Los Angeles.         She came to her life in film and video after a career in dance. Her concern with movement led her to motion pictures, and among her earliest films were dance-related shorts. ''I became more interested in people than abstractions,'' she said.         Reared in Manhattan and educated at the Lincoln School, Miss Clarke was the eldest of three daughters of the former Florence Rosenberg and Samuel N. Brimberg, a wealthy manufacturer.         ''Daddy was of the school which felt that men didn't talk about important matters to women,'' Miss Clarke once said. ''I guess I always had an enormous need to show him I wasn't the dope he thought I was.''         She said she attended seven different colleges without graduating. ''I studied anything as long as I could keep on dancing,'' she said.         For several years, she studied and danced with Martha Graham and Hanya Holm and was 17 when she offered her first work as a choreographer.         Her marriage in 1943 to Bert Clarke ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Dundy, who lives in Los Angeles, she is survived by another sister, Betty Lorwin of Brooklyn, and a daughter, Wendy, a video artist who also lives in Los Angeles.         As Miss Clarke lay dying, she was visited in her hospital room by her daughter and a group of friends, all film and video makers, who sipped Champagne as they reminisced about her and her work and how it paved the way for the MTV generation.         The next day, Ms. Dundy described the gathering to their sister Betty, who replied, ''It's so like a film Shirley would make.''         Correction:  September 29, 1997, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the filmmaker Shirley Clarke referred imprecisely to a documentary she directed. The film, ''Robert Frost: A Lover's Quarrel With the World,'' won an Academy Award in 1963 not for her but for its producer, Robert Hughes.       
         Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the poorest of the world's poor, died yesterday in Calcutta, India, where she had lived since her work with the destitute began five decades ago. She was 87.         Mother Teresa was hospitalized several times last year with heart, lung, kidney and other problems, and also suffered ill health in earlier years. Her physician in Rome, Vincenzo Bilotta, said she suffered cardiac arrest during the evening at her convent in Calcutta, The Associated Press reported.         As her health deteriorated over the past year, Mother Teresa stepped aside and her order, the Missionaries of Charity, chose a new leader, Sister Nirmala, in March.         Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in what is now Macedonia, was revered in India, where she worked for 68 years and became a citizen.         She also came to be honored around the world for the compassionate, effective way she set up and oversaw projects to provide care and comfort to the very poor and the very sick, orphans, lepers and the dying.         Traveling widely even in her later years, she became known to millions as a slight, brown-eyed figure -- she was only 5 feet tall -- smiling and dressed in the plain white sari with blue trim of her order.         Her work was considered by some a rebuke to widespread feelings of personal powerlessness in middle-class and wealthy societies. In 1968, Pope Paul VI praised her as an ''intrepid messenger of the love of Christ.''         The Nobel Committee said its award to her in 1979 was ''for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress in the world, which also constitute a threat to peace.'' Informed of the honor, she said simply, ''I am unworthy.''         But she came in for criticism, too. A British television documentary in 1994 contended that perceptions of her were colored by ''hyperbole and credulity.''         Mother Teresa, who had been a school administrator in a suburb of Calcutta, began working in the slums of that poverty-ridden and densely populated city in 1948. She had received what she described as a divine ''call within a call'' two years earlier while riding on a train. ''The message was quite clear,'' she recalled. ''I was to help the poor while living among them. It was an order.''         In 1950 she established the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, becoming its Superior General. She went on to organize far-flung programs for the impoverished, eventually reaching more than 90 countries.         Her chief task, as she defined it, was to provide ''free service to the poor and the unwanted, irrespective of caste, creed, nationality or race.''         In predominantly Hindu India, she made sure that the priests of her order gave last rites, the Roman Catholic sacrament for the dying, only on request, and that they dealt with the dead according to the practices of the individual's own religion. For the living, Mother Teresa set up orphanages, schools in slums and Pure Heart Homes for sick and dying homeless people.         Over the years, her work expanded. She set up mobile health clinics, centers for the malnourished, rehabilitation hospices for lepers, homes for alcoholics and drug addicts, and shelters for the homeless. Her centers in the United States included the Gift of Love Hospice for 15 men with AIDS, at 657 Washington Street, in Greenwich Village.         The number of sisters in her religious order, only 62 in 1957, grew enormously. By the time Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize, her order had attracted 1,800 nuns and 120,000 lay workers, running more than 80 centers in India and more than 100 others in other parts of the world. The order's patients included 53,000 lepers.         By 1988, her order was operating 600 mobile health clinics where almost four million people received treatment. That year Mother Teresa visited South Africa, which was still under apartheid rule, to set up a hostel in a black township. By early 1992, experts on Catholic welfare work reported, members of her order -- 4,000 nuns and novices, 400 priests and brothers and hundreds of thousands of lay volunteers -- worked at 450 sites worldwide, including in Albania and Iraq.         Aid and Tribute, But No Pity         Mother Teresa often paid tribute to the stricken people she cared for. Speaking to a gathering at the United Nations in 1975, she recalled a woman she had found dying on a Calcutta street.         ''I knew she was dying,'' she said softly. ''After I did what I could, she took my hand, gave me a beautiful smile and thanked me. She gave me more than I gave her.''         Mother Teresa put particular emphasis on giving the deprived and the sick a sensation of dignity through personal contact. ''Ours is a humble service,'' she said in an interview in 1975. ''We try to remain right down on the ground.''         But she said pity did not help the poor. They ''don't need pity, they need love and compassion,'' she once said, adding, ''If you don't know them, you don't love them and don't serve them.''         She said some people used to advise her that her order should have fans in some rooms used by its nuns. ''I do not want them to have fans,'' she continued. ''The poor whom they are to serve have no fans. Most of the girls come from village homes where they had no fans. They should not be more comfortable here than at home.''         In addition to piety, humility and warmth, she displayed strength of will, blunt practicality and organizational talent. The Nobel Committee said it meant to honor her as much for her managerial skills as for her devotion to the poor.         Mother Teresa earned her Nobel Prize despite a political climate in India that was unfavorable to foreign missionaries. In the 1970's the Government took measures to discourage such work, and by the time she won the prize the number of missionaries in India had shrunk to only a few hundred. It had formerly been 6,000. In 1979 there were about 15 million Christians in the country, 2.4 percent of the population of 630 million.         On certain social questions, Mother Teresa adhered outspokenly to the doctrine of her church. She voiced strong opposition to contraception, abortion and divorce.         In accepting the Nobel Prize, she declared: ''To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations. The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.''         Strong Adherence To Church Doctrine         In 1995, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, she helped dedicate a shelter in Washington for women and newborn infants. The center was meant to discourage abortions by providing quarters for children waiting to be adopted or put in foster homes.         And in February 1996, Senator Bob Dole, campaigning in Iowa for the Republican Presidential nomination, declared that Mother Teresa had called to praise him for helping pass a ban against certain types of late-term abortions.         In 1995, before a referendum in Ireland was narrowly passed to end a constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, opponents of the law were exasperated when a hand-written letter from Mother Teresa urging a ''no'' vote was made public.         On another occasion, she contended in effect that women's place was in the home, ''allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.''         Criticism of her came from various quarters. In an interview in 1995 in Calcutta, Debasis Bhattachariya of the Indian Science and Rationalists Association declared, ''Mother Teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen, because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society.''         Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation, voiced particularly strong criticism of her in a 1995 book, ''The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice'' (Verso). Mr.  Hitchens contended that she had ''furnished P.R.-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen.'' Her success, he said, ''depends on the exploitation of the simple and the humble by the cunning and the single-minded.''         The Philadelphia Inquirer's review of the book carried the headline, ''A Salvo of Cheap Shots Fired at a Contemporary Saint.''         The 1994 British television documentary that criticized Mother Teresa, titled ''Hell's Angel,'' was also written by Mr. Hitchens. Asked about the documentary, Mother Teresa said simply, ''Forgive them for they know not what they do.''         In the United States, her views were of such wide interest that ''The Simple Path,'' a book of her thoughts, experiences and beliefs compiled by Lucinda Vardey, was a best seller for 12 weeks in 1995 and 1996.         She was ''an incredible person,'' President Clinton said yesterday in Edgartown, Mass., where he was on vacation. The House of Representatives, observed a moment of silence.         Answering the Call To Become a Nun         Mother Teresa was born Agnes Bojaxhiu on either Aug. 26 or 27, 1910, to Albanian parents in Skopje, about 200 miles south of Belgrade. Studded with churches and mosques, the city is today the capital of Macedonia, but was then ruled by Ottoman Turks, before becoming part of Serbia in 1913.         Accounts have differed as to the profession of her father. An authorized biography of her that came out in Britain in 1992 said he was a building contractor. While a schoolgirl, she belonged to a Catholic lay women's group. At its meetings, letters were read from Balkan Jesuits who had gone as missionaries to Bengal, in eastern India.         At the age of 12 she first felt the desire to become a nun. At 18 she decided to do so and got in touch with the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish Catholic order with missions in Bengal. She joined the order in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin, in 1928. After English lessons there, she spent a more than a year in Darjeeling, north of Calcutta, where the order ran a girls' school.         She then became a teacher, mainly of geography and also of history and catechism, at St. Mary's High School, on the grounds of the Entally Convent outside Calcutta. Many of her pupils came from poor families. In time she learned Bengali and Hindi and became the school's principal.         It was while riding on a train on Sept. 10, 1946, that she received her ''call within a call,'' she said. She left her school and learned nursing skills from other nuns. Then she began her good works among Calcutta's poor, feeling uncertainties at first but also happiness as she set about meeting peoples' needs. ''I knew where I belonged,'' she recalled, ''but I did not know how to get there.''         Before long -- in 1950 -- she won canonical recognition for her new order, the Missionaries of Charity. The religious sisters who joined took vows of chastity, obedience, poverty and service.         One day in 1952, as her longtime associate Sister Agnes recalled years later, ''she found an old woman dying in the streets.''         ''We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital,'' Sister Agnes said, ''but before we could, she died. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.''         And so Mother Teresa set about establishing a home for the dying destitute. She persuaded Calcutta's municipal authorities to give her a shabby one-story building, which happened to stand next to a complex of Hindu shrines.         In that humble structure, she succeeded in creating a place where those who died would do so with dignity. The space was cleaned. The dying were cared for with compassion. The establishment was called Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart.         Mother Teresa's undertakings continued, one after another. There was a home for abandoned children, a leper colony and an old people's home. She went on to set up welfare institutions ranging from a family clinic, to mobile leprosy clinics, to nurseries for abandoned children.         A Strong Disdain For Mere Money         Her work brought in donations from admirers. She liked to say that money was ''really no problem, we depend on divine providence,'' and she said simply that her works were underwritten by ''cash and kind.''         She recalled that when her order opened a house in New York, ''Terence Cardinal Cooke was very anxious that he should give every month a maintenance for the sisters.''         ''I didn't want to hurt him,'' she said, ''but I didn't know how to explain to him that our services are purely for the love of God and that we cannot accept maintenance. I expressed it the only way I could: 'Your Eminence, I don't think God is going to become bankrupt in New York City!' ''         One longtime source of support was Catholic Relief Services, the overseas aid agency of the United States bishops, which operates in scores of countries. Its backing came largely in donations of United States Government surplus food.         In 1971 Mother Teresa's order opened its first house in the United States, in Harlem. It was soon moved to the Bronx, where, on a visit to the United States in 1980, Mother Teresa helped open a soup kitchen and declared her thanks to the poor people of New York ''for allowing themselves to be taken care of'' by her order. In 1981, she opened a mission in Newark.         Then in 1982, when she was 72, she worked for a number of days in Beirut, Lebanon, crisscrossing the Green Line that divided Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. She rescued dozens of mentally ill children from the dangers of warfare in the Muslim part of the city.         One of her biographers, Eileen Egan, reported in a 1985 book, ''Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa -- the Spirit and the Work,'' that a Red Cross official who helped her observed later: ''What stunned everyone was her energy. We didn't expect a saint to be so efficient.''         After suffering heart problems, Mother Teresa sent her resignation as head of her order to Pope John Paul II early in 1990. She said the time had come for ''younger hands.'' A new head was to be chosen that September. But when the time came she told reporters in Calcutta that God's will had kept her from stepping down. Catholic clergymen said she had been prevented from doing so when members of the order's electoral college, gathered from many countries, had been unable to agree on her successor. They re-elected her to her post.         Over the years, she received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees from universities ranging from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome to Harvard. She was awarded the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award. And she was an honorary citizen of Assisi, the hill town in central Italy where Francis of Assisi was born in 1182.         In addition to all her good works, Mother Teresa found time to compose prayers, including this one:         Make us worthy, Lord,         To serve our fellow men         Throughout the world who live and die         In poverty or hunger.         Give them, through our hands         This day their daily bread,         And by our understanding love,         Give peace and joy.         But she could also be briskly prosaic. In an interview in 1994 she said: ''I work all day. That is the best way.''       
         Connie Clausen, an actress and literary agent who began her career by riding circus elephants, died on Sept. 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Stedman Mays, an associate of Ms. Clausen's literary agency.         Ms. Clausen's career began in the 1940's when she rode atop elephants for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, providing the material for her memoir, ''I Love You Honey, but the Season's Over.'' After leaving the circus, she went to work at M-G-M studios in Hollywood, rising from messenger to director of special promotions.         In New York, she landed several roles on Broadway and television before becoming a publicity agent for Macmillan publishing in the 1970's. She helped publicize two of the company's international best-sellers, ''Watership Down'' and ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' and in 1973 was made an assistant vice president.         She left Macmillan in 1976 to start her own agency, Connie Clausen & Associates, which was a pioneer in the so-called beauty book, beginning with a series of best sellers by the photographer Francesco Scavullo. Other successful categories for Ms. Clausen were memoirs and biographies, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, and Quentin Crisp's ''Resident Alien: The New York Diaries.''         Ms. Clausen's three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Michael Andersen of San Francisco; a brother, Harold, of Orlando, Fla., and a sister, Dolores Clausen Brockmeyer of Sarasota, Fla.       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Toby Lelyveld, a teacher of literature who specialized in the stage history of Shakespeare's plays, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Her book, ''Shylock on the Stage'' (Western Reserve University, 1960), traced the way the moneylender in ''The Merchant of Venice'' was played by great actors, including Charles Macklin in 1741, Edmund Kean in 1814, Edwin Booth in 1861 and Henry Irving in 1879.         Noting that Shylock appeared in only 5 of the 20 scenes and had only 30 major speeches, she called the role ''a comparatively scanty part'' -- one that, perhaps more than any other in Shakespeare, was at the mercy of the actor. For that reason, she said, the character's evolution in the 19th and 20th centuries mirrored shifts in social attitudes toward Jews in Britain and the United States.         Mrs. Lelyveld, the former Toby Bookholtz, received her bachelor's degree in 1933 and her master's degree in 1943, both from Teachers College of Columbia University. She received her doctorate in English literature from Columbia in 1951.         She taught at Teachers College, the University of Omaha, Western Reserve University, the Columbia University School of the Arts and the Juilliard School.         From 1948 to 1956, she was the director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation at Hunter College.         In the 1960's and 1970's, she edited program notes for the Theater Recording Society, Caedmon Records and Spoken Arts Recordings.         Her marriage to Rabbi Arthur J. Lelyveld of Cleveland ended in divorce in 1964.         They had three sons: Joseph, executive editor of The New York Times; David, of Manhattan and Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael, of Lexington, Mass. She is also survived by two sisters, Mildred Rosenbaum and Roslyn Klibanoff, both of Florence, Ala., and five grandchildren.       
         Annette Barbara Weiner, an anthropologist and former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 64 and also had a residence in Wolcott, Vt.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Weiner became widely known in her field in the 1970's, when she retraced the steps of Bronislav Malinovski in the Trobriand Islands of the southwest Pacific. She was the recipient of this year's Distinguished Service Award of the American Anthropological Society.         At her death she was the Kriser Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at N.Y.U. She had resigned the deanship last year because of her illness.         Malinovski had brought attention to the Trobriands -- a small group of volcanic islands in Papua New Guinea -- more than five decades earlier. Dr. Weiner complemented his pioneering studies of their indigenous people by showing the importance of women in structures of authority and social relationships.         She distilled her research in ''Women of Value, Men of Renown: New Perspectives in Trobriand Exchange'' (U. of Texas Press, 1976). Written originally as a doctoral thesis, it commanded rare attention.         Dr. Weiner's original name was Annette Cohen. She was born in Philadelphia, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 and received a doctorate from Bryn Mawr College in 1974. She joined the  N.Y.U. faculty in 1981 as a professor and chairman of the Department of Anthropology.         She was a founding member, director and past president of the Society for Cultural Anthropology.         Dr. Weiner's first two marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Dr. William E. Mitchell, a retired professor of anthropology at the University of Vermont; a daughter and son by her first marriage, Linda Hoffman Matisse of Groton, Mass., and Jon Winer of Owings Mills, Md.; two stepchildren, Edward Mitchell of Puerto Rico and Elizabeth Mitchell of New Zealand; three brothers, Robert Cohen of Flourtown, Pa., Fred Caine of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Richard Cohen of Upper Darby, Pa., and eight grandchildren.       
         Dr. Elizabeth B. Keller, a biochemist who made it easier to understand a basic principle of life because she had the insight to see a cloverleaf where others saw only an infinitesimally small strand of the genetic material called RNA, died on Saturday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. She was 79 and lived in Ithaca, N.Y.         The cause was complications from acute leukemia, said a sister, Sandy Socolar.         Dr. Keller's cloverleaf model, still used in textbooks, describes transfer RNA, which helps control how the genetic information in DNA is translated into the building of proteins.         Her model was sent to a colleague, Dr. Robert W. Holley, in a Christmas card, according to lore at Cornell University, where she worked in molecular biology from 1965 until close to her death. She retired as a professor emerita in 1988 but continued to do research. The model was later published by Dr. Holley as part of a larger set of work that won him a share of the Nobel Prize for unraveling the genetic code of RNA. Dr. Holley gave some of the prize money to Dr. Keller and others on his research team at Cornell.         Using paper, pipe cleaners or pieces of Velcro, Dr. Keller would make models of the 77 subunits of a kind of transfer RNA. She found that the cloverleaf model best showed how transfer RNA did its work, finding and transporting the right amino acids to be linked together into proteins, said Dr. Joseph Calvo, a biochemist at Cornell.         ''Anybody in the field would know that design today but would not know Betty,'' Dr. Calvo said. ''Her contributions were always behind the scene, looking until she found the shape that something wanted to take.''         Dr. Keller is best known for her early explanations of how proteins are made within cells. ''Her work was like taking the engine out of a car to see how it works,'' Dr. Calvo said. ''If it works outside the car, you know something. She was one of those who figured out a way to make proteins outside the cell so they could be studied.''         Elizabeth Waterbury Beach, the youngest daughter of Congregational missionaries, was born in Changle, in Fujian Province in China.         She studied at Oberlin College and received her B.S. degree at the University of Chicago in 1940, and her Ph.D. at Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan in 1948. She worked at the Huntington Memorial Laboratory of Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard University, the United States Public Health Service and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before Dr. Holley recruited her to join Cornell.         Her marriage to Geoffrey Keller ended in divorce.         Survivors include her husband, Dr. Leonard Spector, and two sisters, Frances B. Bingham of New Haven, and Mrs. Socolar, of Manhattan.       
         Adelma Grenier Simmons, the author of dozens of books on herbs, died on Wednesday at her home on the Caprilands Herb Farm in Coventry, Conn., which she founded in 1929 and developed into a teaching center and a business. She was 93.         Mrs. Simmons, called ''the first lady of herbs'' by the International Herb Association, used her farm as a school of herbal lore and history. For decades, she delivered a one-hour lecture five days a week to visitors, who were then treated to an herbal lunch in the dining room of her colonial house.         An imposing figure given to wearing a cape, Mrs. Simmons lectured authoritatively but with a touch of humor. ''Silver rosemary is good for mind and memory, in case you have need of that,'' she once told a visiting group. ''It's also good in tea. If you don't like that, you can wash your hair with it. If that doesn't work, you can wash your dog's hair with it.''         Mrs. Simmons, whose maiden name was Grenier, was born in Shelton, Vt., where her father, a French-Canadian, was a cabinetmaker. She moved to Hartford after becoming an international buyer for the Albert Steiger department stores. Her parents soon joined her and also found work with the company, but remained homesick for the country.         In 1929, the family bought an abandoned 50-acre farm near the village of North Coventry, which they named Caprilands, and set about raising goats. The family restored the 18th-century buildings on the site, and Mrs. Simmons grew herbs and vegetables, inviting neighbors over to share in the harvest.         ''Caprilands as it now is started with 25 or 30 women cooking together,'' Mrs. Simmons told an interviewer. ''We all brought things from our gardens.''         In the 1940's, after a disastrous season in which all her vegetables died, Mrs. Simmons concentrated on raising herbs, which she sold as live plants and in dried form.         With the publication of ''Herb Gardening in Five Seasons'' in 1963, Caprilands and Mrs. Simmons herself assumed the dimensions of institutions. The farm drew tourists, gardeners and chefs. One distinguished visitor was David Bouley, a neighbor who frequented the gardens as a boy and, after achieving culinary stardom with his restaurant Bouley, returned annually to cook a five-course dinner for his staff and friends. The menu drew liberally on the 300 herbs grown on the farm's 33 thematic gardens, which include the Saints Garden, devoted to medicinal and food herbs; the Silver Garden, which has only silver plants, and the Shakespeare Garden, dedicated to plants mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.         Mrs. Simmons wrote 35 books and many pamphlets on herbs, including ''Saints in My Garden,'' ''The Witches Brew,'' ''The Gold Wreath Book'' and ''A Merry Christmas Herbal.''         She is survived by her third husband, Edward Cook; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. A brief first marriage ended in divorce. Her second husband, George Simmons, died in 1965.       
         Simone Duvalier, who rose from a childhood of poverty and abandonment to become the wife of one Haitian dictator, mother of another and a power in her own right, died of undisclosed causes in a clinic outside Paris on Friday. She was in her mid-80's and had lived in France since being forced into exile almost 12 years ago.         During the nearly 30 years that her husband, Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, and son, Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, dominated the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere through a combination of brutality, intimidation and guile, Simone Duvalier was often regarded as a power behind the throne. Because of her acquired status, her reputation for vanity and her imperious bearing, ordinary Haitians often referred to her sarcastically as ''Mama Doc.''         Mrs. Duvalier's influence probably reached its peak after the death of her husband in 1971, when her son, still a teen-ager, succeeded his father as Haiti's ''President for Life.'' She relished the title of First Lady and the power it conferred, and was said by associates to deeply resent having to relinquish that role after Jean-Claude Duvalier married Michele Bennett in a lavish wedding ceremony in 1981.         Like her rapacious husband, who systematically looted Haiti's treasury during his years in power, Mrs. Duvalier was reported to be a voodoo adept, and inspired dread among Haiti's poor and illiterate masses. Nevertheless, she cultivated the image of a benefactor, dispensing charity to inhabitants of ''Cite Simone,'' a ''planned settlement'' named for her that is known today as ''Cite Soleil'' and is perhaps the most miserable slum in Latin America.         Mrs. Duvalier's own origins, however, were exceedingly humble. Born Simone Ovide, she was the illegitimate daughter of a well-known mulatto merchant and scholar, Jules Faine, and one of the maids in his household, giving her a socially dubious lineage that in her later years she sought to conceal.         Though Mrs. Duvalier was never willing to disclose her precise date of birth, she is believed to have been born about 1913 near the southern Haitian town of Leogane. At an early age, however, her mother gave her up, and she spent much of her childhood in an orphanage in Petionville, an upper-class suburb in the hills above Port-au-Prince.         Because some members of the local elite took an interest in the institution, the wards of the orphanage were encouraged to acquire some sort of vocational skill, a phenomenon unusual in Haiti at that time. As a result, Simone Ovide was trained as a nurse's aide, and was working in that capacity when she met and was soon being courted by a young doctor named Francois Duvalier.         Then as now, Haitians fortunate enough to enter a profession ordinarily would not marry beneath their class. But Simone Ovide's light skin, good looks, unusual height and haughty demeanor were apparently enough to overcome any social handicaps, and the couple married just after Christmas in 1939.         As Francois Duvalier rose through the Haitian bureaucracy, becoming Minister of Public Health and Labor in 1949 and winning election to the presidency in 1957, Simone was right beside him. Throughout his 14 years in office, she zealously guarded access to her husband and developed and promoted her own coterie of palace favorites.         ''She had a lot of power, but it wasn't an idyllic marriage,'' said Bernard Diederich, author of a biography of Francois Duvalier. ''The old dictator and his wife were often at odds over family matters.''         During her son's years in power, Simone Duvalier's taste for luxury, exceeded only by that of Michele Bennett, grew even more pronounced, and corruption markedly increased. A tense relationship with her daughter-in-law encouraged Jean-Claude to build lavish palaces and weekend retreats, and Mrs. Duvalier was the moving force behind the construction of an elaborate mausoleum for her husband, today a museum, where she, too, planned to be buried.         But when her son was ousted from power in February 1986, Mrs. Duvalier joined him and his wife in exile, first in the French Alps and then in Paris. She was rarely seen in public from that point on, and was reported by old acquaintances in Port-au-Prince to be pining for Haiti and eager to return to her homeland when political conditions allowed.         In recent years, after Jean-Claude's bitter divorce from Michele, Mrs. Duvalier was again said to be with her son in France, amid widespread reports they were living in a state of virtual poverty.         Such speculation is sure to be fed by the decision to cremate Mrs. Duvalier's body, a procedure that believers in voodoo normally seek to avoid, rather than incur the cost of a burial plot.
