Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.

She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.

She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Herta Prager, former chief librarian of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer of the colon and the liver, said her daughter, Katharine P. Darrow of Brooklyn.         Mrs. Prager, a native of Fiume, Austria-Hungary, now Yugoslavia, received a doctorate from the University of Munich before coming to the United States in 1935. She received a law degree at the University of Chicago, practiced law in Chicago and studied at the library school of the university.         She became law librarian at Northwestern University and a bureau head at the New Jersey State Library before orking at the Court of Appeals, from 1974 to 1980. She continued to work at the library after retiring.         Mrs. Prager was the widow of Frank Prager, a patent lawyer. Surviving are a daughter, Katharine P. Darrow, who is vice president of The New York Times Company for broadcasting, information services and corporate development; a sister, Marion Schild of Brooklyn, a retired librarian at the Library of Congress, and three grandchildren.       
         Ruth McAneny Loud, a former president of the Municipal Arts Society, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after emergency surgery for an ulcer, her daughter, Margaret Faron, said.         Mrs. Loud, a native and lifelong resident of Manhattan, was active in civic affairs for several decades. She was a daughter of George McAneny, who was Manhattan Borough President from 1910 to 1913 and president of the New York City Board of Alderman from 1914 to 1916. She was a graduate of the Brearley School and of Bryn Mawr.

In 1965 she was elected president of the Municipal Arts Society and remained a member of its board of directors until her death.         She was co-author with Agnes Wales of "New York! New York! A Knickerbocker Holiday for You and Your Children" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1946).

         Frances Arick Kolb, an education consultant who worked to shape public school curriculums that would encourage achievement by girls and minorities, died last Saturday at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 53 years old and lived in Marlborough.         Dr. Kolb died of breast cancer, said Max McConkey, director of The Network Inc., of Andover, Mass.         She had been associated with The Network, a nonprofit research and training organization since 1980. She was also associate director of the New England Center for Equity Assistance, a federally supported program to provide help to schools dealing with desegregation.         An advocate of textbooks reflecting the contributions of women and minorities, she was the producer of a video directed toward people of Hispanic descent, "Breaking Through -- Portraits of Winners." She also wrote several books including "Portraits of Our Mothers; Using Oral History in the Classroom" (The Network Inc., 1983).

Dr. Kolb was born in Worcester, Mass., and graduated in 1958 from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1972 she earned a Ph.D. in American history there.         She is survived by her husband, Alfred, professor of the humanities at Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester; her mother, Beth Arick of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Sharon Cohen, also of Brookline, and a brother, Martin R. Arick of Newton, Mass.       
         Marie Provaznik, a leader of the nationalist Sokol gymnastics movement in Czechoslovakia who defected to the United States after directing the Czechoslovak women's contingent at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, died on Jan. 11 at St. Clair's Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y. She was 100 years old, and her family said she suffered a stroke two weeks earlier.         As the leader of 500,000 women in the Czechoslovak Sokol organizations after World War II, Mrs. Provaznik was regarded in her homeland as a national heroine.         Sokol, the Czech word for falcon, symbolizing freedom, was established in 1863 to combine athletics suggestive of an army in training with national democractic resistance. Allowed to Keep Position         At the time of her defection in 1948, the year a Communist Government took over her country, Mrs. Provaznik was president of the women's divisions of both the Czechoslovak gymnastics organization and the International Gymnastics Federation in Geneva.         She was also such a popular figure that when the nation's Sokol leaders were arrested after the Communist takeover Mrs. Provaznik was allowed to retain her position.         Indeed, even after she announced that she would not return to Czechoslovakia after the 1948 Summer Games because "it is the only way to be a free agent," a spokesman for the Czechoslovak Embassy in London praised her as a "fine instructor" and an "outstanding athlete," and declared that she was going to the United States "with the blessing and knowledge of Prague."  Taught in New Jersey         In the United States, Mrs. Provaznik, who became an American citizen in 1954, taught physical education at Panzer College in New Jersey, and was active in Sokols established in New York and elsewhere.         Mrs. Provaznik, whose husband, Frantisek, died in 1948, is survived by a daughter, Dr. Alena Polesny, of Altamont, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Allison Moore Coudert, a philanthropist who was active in civic causes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of pneumonia, said her daughter, Allison P. Coudert of Tempe, Ariz.         Mrs. Coudert was a member of the A.S.P.C.A.'s Founder's Society and supported museums and social welfare organizations in New York. She was past secretary of the Child Adoption Service of the Children's Aid Society and had been treasurer of the Oyster Bay Visiting Nurse Association on Long Island for many years. She attended Vassar College and served on the board of the Women's City Club.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Alexis, of McLean, Va.; a sister, Nina Moore Galston of Huntington, L.I.; a granddaughter, and a great-grandson.       
         Mary Goldburt Siegel, a lawyer who in the 1920's helped break down barriers against women in the legal profession, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.         She died of lymphoma, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Siegel, a 1917 graduate of New York University Law School, passed the bar examination at a time when there were only a handful of women in the profession. In 1921, after leaving the profession for two years to have a baby, she began to search for a position as a law clerk. At the time, a year as a clerk was a requirement for being admitted to the bar. In a 1982 article written for The Women's Rights Law Reporter, she recalled that while such positions were readily available for men, there were practically none for women.         After a long search, a law school classmate finally hired her at no salary. A few months later, she took another position that paid her $4 a week to do some law research, but in which she primarily ran errands. The salary was $1 a week more than what she had earned operating a sewing machine in a garment center sweatshop when she came from Russia in 1911. Men in similar law clerk positions were being paid $15 to $25 a week.         She finished her apprenticeship at another law firm that gave her broader experience but paid her nothing.         Her first courtroom experience produced other traumas. "When my case was called and I walked over to the appropriate table, a bailiff rushed over to direct me to where he said I belonged -- the spectator's bench," she wrote.         A short while later, the judge presiding over the case asked to speak to the lawyers.         "As I walked toward him, I was reproached by the judge, who virtually sneered when he repeated that he wanted to confer with the legal representatives, not an office stenographer," she added.         Mrs. Siegel said that throughout her legal career she had to fight against the sexist attitudes of colleagues and clients, who usually expected her to work for a lower fee than her male counterparts. She had to prove herself constantly, she said, until the situation improved in the 1960's and 70's as more and more women became lawyers. She was in private practice when she retired about 10 years ago.         Mrs. Siegel was an assistant corporation counsel for New York City during the administration of Mayor John F. Hylan in the 1920's.         Her husband, Jacob, died in 1987. She is survived by a son, Eugene, a certified public accountant in New Rochelle, N.Y.; a daughter, Dr. Irene Thompson, professor emeritus at the University of Florida at Gainesville, and four grandchildren.       
         Jane Murchison Haber, a leader in volunteer activities in Dallas and later in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.         She died in her sleep, a family spokeswoman said.         In Manhattan, where she had lived since the 1970's, Mrs. Haber was a director of the New York Infirmary and a trustee of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. In Dallas, she was a co-founder of the Auction for Cultural Arts and a former chairwoman of the annual Crystal Charity Ball.         She is survived by her husband, Leonard Haber, a New York architectural and industrial designer; three sons and a daughter from her marriage to the Texas businessman Clinton Murchison: Clint Murchison 3d, Burk Murchison and Robert Murchison, all of Dallas, and Coke Anne Saunders of Manhattan, and 11 grandchildren.       
         With reminiscences and some of her favorite songs, friends of Mary Martin gathered at the Majestic Theater yesterday afternoon to celebrate her life.         Miss Martin, who died of cancer in November at the age of 76, was recalled as a high-spirited artist who personified some of her signature roles; the eternal child in "Peter Pan," the "cockeyed optimist" in "South Pacific," the ebullient and nurturing protector in "The Sound of Music."         "She was the greatest figure we're ever going to have in musical comedy," said Helen Hayes. She quickly amended the announcement to include Ethel Merman. "Mary would rap me over the knuckles in heaven when I got there," she said, if she did not cite Miss Merman.         Miss Hayes remembered a trip with Miss Martin 35 years ago to Paris, where they were to perform in "The Skin of Our Teeth." Miss Martin took along grand clothes, she recalled, and as they walked through the city one day, "suddenly overhead there was a swoosh of birds," one of whom "took perfect aim on Mary."         "I didn't know her too well," she said, and she feared Miss Martin would "have hysterics" at the marring of her outfit. But, Miss Hayes said, there was Miss Martin "looking at me with a sort of half-smile, and she said, 'For some people, they         sing.'         That was the beginning of our friendship." Gold Dust From the Air         Van Johnson told of the time Miss Martin decided to stage a benefit for a hospital where she had been recovering from a 1982 automobile accident. To his horror, he saw her putting on a harness to reprise a number from "Peter Pan." "I said, 'Mary, you're         not!' "         he recounted, "and she said, 'Oh, yes, I am, and I may not come back.' And she zoomed up to the roof and sprinkled gold dust all over our hair."         Recalling the same car accident and another sign of the artist's indomitable temperament, Florence Henderson cited a time when Miss Martin, still a patient, was given a walker, an object she had apparently never encountered. She took it on a promenade down the corridor. Other people smiled, and she smiled back, Ms. Henderson recalled, adding that "she was         carrying         the walker."         She described Miss Martin as "truly the purest soul that I have ever known," adding, "She was so generous; she always let people into her circle of light." As for artistry, Ms. Henderson recalled a tribute that Miss Merman had made, in her fashion. Asked by a reporter what she had thought of Miss Martin's performance at the opening of "South Pacific," Ms. Henderson said, Miss Merman snapped, "Oh, she's all right, if you like talent.' " New Lyrics to a Favorite Song         In one of several videotapes shown, Miss Martin and Miss Merman were seen singing a medley, alternating, performing together and gradually turning the duet into a mock competition.         Carol Channing performed a tribute to Miss Martin that put new words to "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," the song that propelled Miss Martin to Broadway success in 1938 in Cole Porter's "Leave It To Me." "She played a nurse/She played a nun/She played a boy who was a fairy," Ms. Channing sang. "She stopped the show when she had to crow/And our hearts belong to Mary."         Other participants included the performers John Raitt, Carol Lawrence and Kathleen Nolan and the choreographer Jerome Robbins. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent remarks in a videotape. Miss Martin's son, the actor Larry Hagman, and daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, introduced the program.         The event concluded with a 1983 videotape of Miss Martin singing a song from "Peter Pan." The tape's final image, of the artist with her arms outstretched, remained on the screen as participants in the memorial returned to the stage to applaud it.       
         Charlotte L. Peskin, chairwoman and president of Polyplastex United, a producer of interiors for aircraft cabins, died on Tuesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 76 years old and lived in Tamarac, Fla.         She died of peritonitis after surgery, her family said.         Mrs. Peskin was the daughter of Louis Schnitzer, founder of the Yiddish Art Theater in New York, and his wife, Henriette, a noted actress on the Yiddish stage. Mrs. Peskin was a child actress before attending Pratt Institute, where she received a degree in art.         A longtime resident of Brooklyn and West Hempstead, L.I., Mrs. Peskin became secretary of Polyplastex, a publicly held family concern, in 1963. She was named chairwoman and president two years ago.         She is survived by her husband, Sidney, also an officer of Polyplastex; two sons, Roger, of Milford, N.J., and Dennis, of Tarpon Springs, Fla., who are also Polyplastex officers, and three granddaughters.       
         Marion Savage Rosette, a pianist, teacher and composer of children's songs, died at her home in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was 90 years old.         She died of brain cancer, said her daughter, Margot Sohmer of Jackson Heights, Queens.         "Katie the Kangaroo," "City Mouse and Country Mouse" and "The Monkey Who Wanted to Fly" are among the songs by Mrs. Rosette that were familiar to a generation of children who watched the television show "Captain Kangaroo." She also wrote nightclub and music hall material.         She was a native of Baltimore and studied piano at the Peabody Conservatory of Music there. On several occasions, she was the soloist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. She also worked as an accompanist for many dancers, singers and instrumentalists.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two granddaughters, Emily Tai and Olivia Sohmer, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Ruth Dietz, who headed the Woolen Corporation of America in the 1950's, died on Monday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Dietz, a native of Manhattan, took over direction of the Woolen Corporation in 1950 on the death of her first husband, Louis Surut, who founded the concern in 1920.         In 1952 she married Arthur O. Dietz, president of the CIT Financial Corporation, who died in 1967.         Mrs. Dietz is survived by a daughter, Elaine Fenton of Manhattan; a son, Lee E. Surut of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, Monroe Rubinger of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ralph Rubinger of Palm Beach, Fla.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Cipe Pineles Burtin, who broke the sex barrier at the Art Directors Club of New York by becoming a member in 1943 and went on to become the first woman inducted into its Hall of Fame, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Stony Point, N.Y.         Mrs. Burtin, who worked under the name Cipe Pineles (pronounced seep pin-ELL-iss), suffered from chronic kidney disease and died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She was the former head of publication design at the Parsons School of Design and a former art director of British Vogue, Seventeen, Charm and Mademoiselle magazines.         In 1943, she became the first woman to join the Art Directors Club of New York and was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in 1975 -- the only woman inducted until last year.         In 1967 she became design consultant to Lincoln Center and a member of the faculty at Parsons.         She was a member of the visiting committee for the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and a former board member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. She was also a former Andrew Mellon Professor at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.         She was born in Vienna and came to the United States at the age of 13. She attended Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn and won a Tiffany Foundation Scholarship to Pratt Institute. In 1932 she became assistant to M.F. Agha, the art director of Conde Nast.         Twice widowed, Mrs. Burtin is survived by a son, Thomas Pineles Golden of Stony Point, N.Y.; a daughter, Carol Burtin Fripp of Toronto, and two grandchildren.       
         Edythe W. Donovan, a senior lawyer with the firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed in Manhattan, died on Thursday at New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center.

         LuEsther T. Mertz, a general partner in Publishers Clearing House who was known for her extensive philanthropy on behalf of the arts and other causes, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 85 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         She had had several strokes in recent weeks, said her lawyer, William B. O'Connor.         Mrs. Mertz became a general partner in Publishers Clearing House, the magazine-subscription business, soon after its founding in 1953 by her husband, Harold E. Mertz, and their daughter, Joyce Mertz Gilmore. She and her husband were later divorced.         She was the chairman of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival from 1973 to 1987 and underwrote moving several of its productions from the Public Theater to Broadway, including "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Chorus Line."         Recalling her support for the arts and her interest in social justice, Mr. Papp said that despite her wealth, "there was nothing in her that suggested anyone was different from anyone else." He described her as high-spirited but said she "never wanted to be in the spotlight."         Mrs. Mertz, a longtime supporter of dance, was on the board of the Original Ballets Foundation, which operates the Feld Ballets/NY and the New Ballet School. She also supported the New York City Ballet. The Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, which opened in 1982 and is devoted to dance, is named in memory of her daughter, who died of cancer in 1974. Literature on Tape         In 1961 she founded Choice Magazine Listening in Port Washington for people who are unable to read regular print. The organization selects articles, fiction and poetry from contemporary periodicals, records them on cassette tapes and distributes the tapes free. To endow the organization, she set up a private foundation, the Lucerna Fund.         The LuEsther T. Mertz Retinal Research Center at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is named for Mrs. Mertz.         She was a major contributor to many New York City cultural and educational institutions, including Lincoln Center and the New York Botanical Garden, and received the Mayor's Award for Arts and Culture in 1983 and the New York State Governor's Arts Award in 1986.         In recent years, she was chairman of the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation, which supports nonprofit activities in human rights, world security and the environment and New York City cultural and civic programs.         She was a trustee of the Port Washington Public Library and a founding member of the Port Washington League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Mertz, whose maiden name was Turner, was born in Cincinnati and grew up in Williamsport, Pa. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1927 with a degree in library science.         Her son, Peter, died in an accident in 1954. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara Dodge Borland, a writer and editor, died on Monday at Sharon (Conn.) Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Salisbury, Conn.         She died of an abdominal aneurysm, said her daughter, Diana Thompson of Cambridge, Mass.         Mrs. Borland wrote two books and collaborated for many years on short stories and novellas with her husband, the nature writer Hal Borland, who died in 1978. In 1962, her book "The Greater Hunger" was published by Appleton-Century Press, and in 1986 "This Is the Way My Garden Grows," was published by W. W. Norton.         She attended Oberlin College, and in the 1930's she ran writing workshops in Manhattan. For several years, she also wrote a gardening column for The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, Mass.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a stepson, Donal Borland of Lithonia, Ga., and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Baldwin Folinsbee, a community leader and former government official in New Hope, Pa., died Wednesday at her home in New Hope. She was 100 years old and died in her sleep, said her daughter, Elizabeth Wiggins of New Hope.         Mrs. Folinsbee was involved in civic activities in her community and was a founder of the New Hope Public Health Association. In 1966, at the age of 75, she was elected to the Borough Council of New Hope and served until 1969.         Her husband, the landscape artist, John F. Folinsbee, died in 1972. In addition to her daughter, Elizabeth, she is survived by another daughter, Joan Cook of Princeton, N.J.; 7 grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren.       
         Miriam Burton Holman, a soprano and actress who appeared on Broadway and in opera, died last Sunday at High Ridge House, a Christian Science nursing facility in the Bronx. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, her daughter, Diedre Greenway of Manhattan, said.         Miss Burton appeared in many Broadway and Off Broadway productions, including "House of Flowers," "Waltz of the Toreadors" and "The Sunshine Boys." Her film credits included "Cotton Comes to Harlem" and "The Landlord," and she had featured roles in the television series "Search for Tomorrow" and "True Blue."

         Katinka Loeser, many of whose short stories were infused with what a critic described as "autobiographical sketches of warmth and charm," died Wednesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Westport.         She died of kidney failure, said her daughter, Jan DeVries.         Miss Loeser published three collections of stories, most of which first appeared in The New Yorker: "Tomorrow Will Be Monday: Stories of Parents and Children" (1964); "The Archers at Home" (1968), about a suburban couple afflicted with empty-nest syndrome, and "A Thousand Pardons" (1982), stories about a Westport couple who enjoy their lives and the changing seasons.         Miss Loeser was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on July 2, 1913, and grew up in Chicago. She started writing poetry when she was 14. In 1943 she won the Young Poet's Prize of Poetry magazine, and her poems later appeared in The New Yorker. She was notified of the Young Poet's Prize in a telegram from the editor of Poetry, the humorist Peter DeVries, whom she married later that year.         In an interview in 1982, Miss Loeser maintained that it is more difficult to write short stories and poetry than novels. With a poem, she said, "You're thinking in abstract terms and trying to get a rhythm." In a novel, she added, "There is more leeway." But to be a successful writer of any kind, she added, "you have to be a decent reader from the time you're small."         At the University of Chicago, from which she graduated in 1936, Miss Loeser studied under the playwright Thornton Wilder, one of her favorite teachers. When she taught a writing class at the Westport Division of Continuing Education in the 1970's, she adopted the Wilder method of reading his students' stories out loud, anonymously, and having the other students critique them.         Miss Loeser is survived by her husband and three children: Jan DeVries of Media, Pa.; Peter Jon, of New York City, and Derek, of Santa Monica, Calif. Another daughter, Emily, died of leukemia in childhood and is remembered in Miss Loeser's story "Whose Little Girl Are You?" and in Mr. DeVries's book "The Blood of the Lamb."       
         Dorothy Kramer, a Long Island church official, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 61 years old and lived in Port Washington.         She died of breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Kramer was active in hospice work in Nassau County and on the Veatch board of governors, the body that decides on charitable contributions for the North Shore Unitarian Universalist Church. She was the church delegate to the International Association of Religious Freedom in California and in the Netherlands.         Mrs. Kramer began teaching in 1966 and retired in 1989 as an elementary and middle-school teacher in the Plainview-Old Bethpage Central School District. She was a past president of the district's local teachers union.         In 1979 and 1980, she developed a curriculum for dyslexic elementary school children for New York State.         Mrs. Kramer is survived by her husband, Donald, a retired procurement officer for the Grumman Aerospace Corporation; two sons, Donald, of Boston, and Theodore Charles of Brattleboro, Vt.; a daughter, Meredith Ann Brown of Harwinton, Conn.; two brothers, Robert G. Schwartz of Exton, Pa., and Louis Schwartz of Buffalo, and four grandchildren.       
         Helen Lee Caldwell, a leading designer of children's clothes in Manhattan for three decades under the name Helen Lee, died on Wednesday at Fort Sanders Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn. She was 82 years old and had lived in Knoxville since 1981.         She died after a series of strokes, a spokesman for the family said.         In 1953 she became the first children's designer to win the Coty American Fashion Critics Award, for her designs for Youngland Inc. The award cited her "significant influence in the development of good taste and charm in children's fashions."  Clothes for Girls and Boys         For the next three decades, Miss Lee designed clothes for infants, girls, boys and teen-agers. She also created designs for Sears, Roebuck & Company; Saks Fifth Avenue; Alyssa, a children's fashion concern, and for her own company, Designs by Helen Lee Inc.         Despite the reputation of English children's clothes as the best in the world, her designs won accolades from critics at a London fashion show in 1962. One of the models, 3-year-old Cathryn Harrison, the granddaughter of the actor Rex Harrison, wore a white eyelet dress sashed with yellow and cried when asked to take the dress off after the showing.         A 1965 showing in Tokyo was received with equal enthusiasm by an international audience.  Designs Shown in Moscow         Miss Lee's designs appeared at the American Fair in Moscow in 1959 and in a dress worn by her granddaughter, Hilary Ball, on the cover of Life magazine in 1959.         As designer and partner of Alyssa, she received a Neiman-Marcus Award in 1958 and the Ethel Traphagen Award in 1970. She retired in the late 1970's.         Miss Lee was born in Knoxville and attended the University of Tennessee before coming to New York, where she studied at the Art Sudents League and at the Traphagen School of Art.         She is survived by a daughter, Jenny Higginbothan Caldwell of Newton, Mass., five grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Lillian Day Lederer, a novelist, biographer and playwright, died yesterday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan, where she had lived for the last eight years. She was 98 years old.         She died of heart failure, a cousin, Alexandra Lippman, said.         She was a native New Yorker, the daughter of two prominent physicians of the 1890's, Dr. Alexander Abrams and Dr. Amelia Fendler.         In the 1920's, she wrote magazine articles as Lillian Day, adopting the surname of her first husband.  In 1931, she wrote the novel "Kiss and Tell" and the next year she collaborated with her second husband, Lyon Mearson, on the novel "Our Wife." Later she was co-author of the mysteries "Murder in Time" and "Death Comes on Friday" with her third husband, Norbert Lederer.         Her 1938 novel, "The Youngest Profession," was made into a film starring Edward G. Robinson. A play, "Collector's Item," written with Alfred Golden, had a short run on Broadway in 1952.         In 1950 she moved to France, where she lived for nearly 30 years in Neuilly-sur-Seine and in Paris, where Mr. Lederer died.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Lola Popper Kramarsky, former president of Hadassah, the national women's Zionist organization, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kramarsky was president of Hadassah from 1960 to 1964 and was active in the organization for much of her adult life. Her particular concerns were with Youth Aliyah, which rescues and rehabilitates displaced children, and the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centr in Jerusalem.         She retired from active Hadassah involvement in 1985. At her death she was an honorary vice president of the organization, whose current membership is 385,000.  Owned Noted Art Collection         With her husband, Siegfried, a banker and philanthropist who died in 1961, Mrs. Kramarsky owned an art collection that was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and included works by Van Gogh, Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, Seurat and Gauguin.         Violet Ingeborg Else Popper was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of an importer who died in 1917. A twin brother was killed in action with the German Army in World War I. With her husband, whom she married in 1921, and children she left Germany in 1932, fleeing the rise of Hitler and anti-Semitism.         The Kramarskys came to the United States from the Netherlands in 1940, aided by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, a family friend who became the first president of Israel.         Mrs. Kramarsky is survived by two sons, Bernard, of Great Neck, L.I., and Werner, of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Sonia Kramarsky of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and three-great grandchildren.       
         Virginia W. Milliken, an animal-rights advocate, died on Friday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 88 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said her daughter, Jane, of Riverside, Conn.         Mrs. Milliken, who opposed the use of animals in medical and scientific experiments, was a director of the Humane Society of the United States and a founder of the Manhattan-based American Fund for Alternatives to Animal Research.         In the 1950's Mrs. Milliken helped establish the first chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in St. Petersburg, Fla.         She was born in Roanoke, Va., and was a graduate of Barnard College.         Besides her daughter, Mrs. Milliken is survived by a granddaughter.

         Ruth Page, a pioneering American ballet dancer and one of the first ballet choreographers to employ American subject matter, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 92 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, said Andrew Mark Wentink, her biographer.         Miss Page, who arranged Rudolf Nureyev's New York debut by engaging him for one of the companies she directed, was involved with an almost bewildering array of activities. She performed with Anna Pavlova's classical ballet company, with Serge Diaghilev's avant-garde Ballets Russes and with German Expressionist modern dancers.         She appeared in opera houses around the world, danced at the coronation of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1928 and gave programs in the Soviet Union in 1930. But she remained proudly American, making Chicago the base of her activities and refusing to change her name at a time when many Americans adopted exotic stage names.  Wide Range as Choreographer         An eclectic choreographer, Miss Page is known for "Hear Ye, Hear Ye" (1934), a ballet about a murder trial to a commissioned score by Aaron Copland; "An American Pattern" (1937), a feminist protest against conformity; "Billy Sunday" (1948), a ballet derived from a fiery evangelist's sermons, and several ballets based on famous operas.         During the 30's, her partner was Bentley Stone, an American choreographer with whom she occasionally collaborated on works. Their most enduring achievement is "Frankie and Johnny," which was inspired by a bawdy old ballad about love and betrayal. Since its premiere in 1938, it has been successfully revived by many companies, including Dance Theater of Harlem. Reviewing a production by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1947, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, "It convinces you of its human truth even while you are chortling at its crude and uninhibited sentimentalities."         Miss Page was born in Indianapolis on March 22, 1899, the daughter of Dr. Lafayette Page, a brain surgeon, and Marian Heinly, a pianist. Her parents encouraged her desire to dance and sent her to study with local teachers. In 1914, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova was a guest at the Page house and was so impressed by Miss Page that she encouraged the teen-ager to make dancing her career. Miss Page appeared briefly with Pavlova's company that year.         Moving to Chicago, Miss Page studied with Adolph Bolm, a former member of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes who had settled in America and was staging productions both for Chicago companies and for his itinerant Ballet Intime. In 1919 Bolm choreographed "The Birthday of the Infanta" for Miss Page, one of the first 20th-century ballets with a score by an American composer (John Alden Carpenter) and scenery by an American designer (Robert Edmond Jones).  In a Stravinsky Premiere         Bolm and Miss Page again made history in 1928, when she portrayed Terpsichore in the world premiere of Stravinsky's "Apollo," choreographed by Bolm in Washington months before George Balanchine created his more familiar version of the ballet for Diaghilev.         Miss Page married Thomas Hart Fisher, a well-to-do Chicago lawyer, in 1925, and on her honeymoon in Europe danced with Diaghilev's company. While she was with the Ballets Russes, Balanchine choreographed two divertissements for her, "Etude" and "Polka Melancolique," which are believed to be his first works created for an American.         Always curious about dance forms, Miss Page studied with Mary Wigman, the great German Expressionist choreographer, in 1930. In 1933, she toured with another important German modern dancer, Harald Kreutzberg.         During the 1940's, she staged works in Chicago and for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She choreographed "Revanche," a ballet version of "Il Trovatore," for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees in Paris in 1951, and "Vilia," an adaptation of "The Merry Widow," for the London Festival Ballet in 1953. Their success prompted her to found the Chicago Opera Ballet in 1956, a touring company that featured ballets inspired by operas and operettas. Yet it also presented internationally known stars in classial excerpts. It was with this troupe that Mr. Nureyev made his New York City debut in 1962. Later known as Ruth Page's International Ballet, it continued until 1970.  An Annual 'Nutcracker'         In Chicago in 1965, Miss Page staged a production of "The Nutcracker" that remains an annual event in that city. She frequently revived her works for regional companies and directed the Ruth Page Foundation School of the Dance, which will continue under the direction of Larry Long.         Miss Page's first husband, Mr. Fisher, died in 1969. She married the French artist and stage designer Andre Delfau in 1983. Miss Page was the author of "Page by Page" (1980) and "Class" (1984). She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1980 and the Illinois Gubernatorial Award in 1985, and held honorary degrees from Indiana University, De Paul University and Columbia College of Chicago.         She is survived by her husband and a brother, Dr. Irvine Page of Hyannis, Mass.       
         Sadie H. Zaidens, a dermatologist and psychiatrist, died on April 1 at St. Clare's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of intestinal bleeding and complications of diabetes, her daughter, Dr. Debra Brand, said.         Dr. Zaidens was first a dermatologist and then became a psychiatrist. She wrote articles on the psychosomatic aspects of dermatology.         She was a native of Manhattan and a graduate of George Washington University and the university's medical school. She studied and practiced with her husband, Morris A. Brand, the medical director of the Sidney Hillman Health Center, who died in 1968.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Farmington, Conn., Dr. Zaidens is survived by a sister, Isabel Levin of Manhattan.       
         Selma Gross, a teacher and administrator in the New York City public school system for 32 years, died on Sunday at the Whitehall Convalescent and Nursing Home in Chicago. She was 57 years old and lived in Chicago.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Gross was the head of the Office of College and Career Planning at the New York City Board of Education from 1985 to 1988, when she moved to Chicago after her husband, Theodore L. Gross, was named president of Roosevelt College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Donna, of Los Angeles; a son, Jonathan, of Manhattan, and two sisters.       
         Louise Dickinson Rich, the author of "We Took to the Woods," a best seller during World War II, died on Tuesday at her daughter's home in Mattapoisett, Mass. She was 87 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Dinah Anderson, said.         "We Took to the Woods" was a witty account of a Thoreau-like existence in a wilderness home in northwestern Maine.         Mrs. Rich was born in Huntington, Mass., and grew up in Bridgewater, where her father was the editor of a weekly newspaper. She met Ralph Eugene Rich, a Chicago businessman, on a Maine canoe trip in 1933 and they married a year later. Mr. Rich died in 1944.         Mrs. Rich wrote a number of books for adults and children, among them "Only Parent" (1953), "Innocence Under the Elms" (1955) and "The Coast of Maine" (1956).         She is survived, in addition to her daughter, by a son, Rufus, of Dresden, Me.; a sister, Alice D. Hoke of Mattepoisett, and a grandson.       
         Grace Hartley Jenkins Mead, a philanthropist and trustee emeritus of Columbia University's Teachers College, died on Wednesday at her home in Morristown, N.J. She was 95 years old and also had residences in Norfolk, Conn., and St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.         She died of heart failure, a grandson, Nicolas W. Platt, said.         She was appointed a trustee of Teachers College in 1934 and later was named trustee emeritus. From 1940 to 1965 she was president of Hartley House, a settlement house on West 46th Street that was named for her great-grandfather, Robert Milham Hartley, a New York civic leader.         For more than 40 years, Mrs. Mead was president of the Hartley Corporation, a philathropic foundation that has contributed to charitable and educational institutions.         She was born in Morristown, the daughter of George W. Jenkins, president of the family-owned Remington Arms Company, and Helen Hartley Jenkins, a benfactor of Columbia University. Mrs. Mead and her cousin, Marcellus Hartley Dodge, were major donors to a building program at Columbia that included the M. H. Dodge gym, Hartley Hall and the gates at Barnard.         Her husband, Winter Mead, an executive for the Prudential Life Insurance Company, died in 1953.         She is survived by a daughter, Helen Hartley Mead Platt of Madison, N.J..; a son, Robert Hartley Mead of Norfolk, Conn., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Marjorie Lee Collins Bishopric, one of the early residents of the Devon Colony in Amagansett, L.I., died on Monday at her daughter's home in Amagansett. She was 79 years old and lived in Amagansett and Greenwich, Conn.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Lucy Allison Sprunger, said.         Her family was among the first to move into the Devon Colony, a group of Mediterranean-style houses privately built in the early 1900's. The houses, no longer a private enclave, have since been declared historic landmarks.         Mrs. Bishopric was an active tennis player into her 70's, and won several amateur tournaments.         Besides her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Allison Bishopric Jr.; a brother, J. Rawson Collins of Cincinnati, and two grandchildren.       
         Joan Colebrook, a writer, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. She was 80 years old and lived in Truro, Mass.         She died after a heart attack, her son Jay Colebrook said.         Mrs. Colebrook wrote two novels in the 1940's, one about pre-World War II life in England, the other, "The Northerner" (1948), about life in Australia, where she grew up.         She received most praise for her nonfiction books. In "The Cross of Lassitude: Portraits of Five Delinquents" (1967), she used her experiences as a social worker and officer in women's prisons to track five teen-age girls through the penal system. She also wrote for Commentary, The New Yorker and other magazines.         In addition to her son Jay, of Geneva, Mrs. Colebrook is survived by another son, John Van Kirk of Boston, and a daughter, Binda, of Seattle.       
         When Carol Perkins sat down in the New York Times cafeteria last week, she pulled down her lower lip and exposed two big white blisters. "They're not herpes," she announced, which certainly turned a lot of heads. But that is something she expects.         Ms. Perkins is a model with the Eileen Ford Agency, and her face -- not to mention the rest of her -- is familiar to anyone who shops through the Victoria's Secret catalogue or reads Vogue. Recently, she has been moonlighting at "Penn and Teller: The Refrigerator Tour," playing at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, which is where the blisters come in. Ms. Perkins works with Penn and Teller, the comic magic team, who bill themselves as "a couple of eccentric guys who've learned to do a few cool things," as a fire-eater.         And if the show's opening act is for the children -- a giant refrigerator is dropped directly on top of the two stars -- then the bit called "Burnin' Luv" is the adults' payoff. Ms. Perkins and Penn Jillette perform a hilarious parody of sex by eating fire, after which Ms. Perkins, wearing an impossibly low-cut dress, strikes a match and lights a cigarette directly from Mr. Jillette's mouth.  An Unmodel-like Model         That someone whose face is her livelihood should take such risks is the height of perversity. But looks aside, Ms. Perkins seems nothing like most models. During the entire lunch she never once mentioned the size of her pores, or how many glasses of water she drank before noon, and she told her age, 33, without hesitation. "Why not?" she asked. "I look pretty good for 33."         She said she loved cafeteria food, and had never had a weight problem. And though she skipped the steam table meat, she eagerly ate up a plate of mashed turnips and peas, which she covered in butter, and followed it with a roll, coffee and a cigarette.         She does dress like a model, perfectly pulled together in a dark turquoise Harris tweed jacket, cashmere sweater, Hermes scarf, corduroy pants and a string of pearls. Then she admitted that she bought the jacket in a thrift shop, on what she called a "junkin' " spree.         Since she learned to eat fire last fall, Ms. Perkins said, she has been "burnt really bad." She pointed to her chin, which looked fine. But she insistently rubbed off her makeup, until the maroon shadow of a burn finally appeared.  A Well-Timed Ignition         Isn't this just about the most awful thing that could happen to her         face?         Her fortune? Apparently not. "I'm not real fussy about things like breaking a nail or getting a wrinkle." Yes, but isn't this is a little more serious? "I couldn't work when I got burned," she said, "but I had taken those two weeks off anyway for rehearsal. It took a couple of weeks for the big old scab to fall off."         Mr. Jillette, who is the tall one, with the ponytail, is Ms. Perkins's partner in "Burnin' Luv." He said in a phone interview: "Her chances of being disfigured and landing in the hospital are slim. Eating fire is safer than walking on the street. She got a nickel-sized blister on her chin, that's all."         Isn't she giving Eileen Ford an ulcer? "Not at all," Ms. Perkins said. "She told me she's never had a model go to Broadway before."'         Also, Ms. Perkins said, there is no insurance policy for her face. She said she didn't need one. "When you're learning to eat fire you're fearful and respectful," she said. "But I got confident and kind of cocky about it, and I just wasn't paying attention. I'm back on guard again."         How did she ever get mixed up in all of this? A longtime fan of Penn and Teller, she arranged an introduction through a friend about a year ago. Last fall, when the duo was rehearsing for an NBC television special, Mr. Jillette called her and asked if she could help find a replacement for Isabella Rossellini, for whom he had written the bit, who had just been cast in a movie. They needed someone famous, Ms. Perkins said, to satisfy the network.         "I suggested Lauren Hutton, who's pretty gutsy, Joan Severance and Carrie Fisher," she said. "I called some girls for him but none came through. Then about a week before the special taped they got into a jam. Penn called me and said: 'We're really on our knees. Can you learn to eat fire so you can show whoever it is we get? You can be the understudy.' And I thought, what a cool thing. I live around the corner from the rehearsal place, so I threw on my jeans and left. I was terrified."         But she turned out to be a quick study, and when no one better known was willing to risk her face, she got the job. "She was our absolute last choice," said Mr. Jillette. "She really likes fire eating, which I don't. When she was learning we would scream at her not to really get comfortable, just to look comfortable."         As the act progressed, the two got comfortable with each other as well, and soon found themselves in the gossip columns. What is it like to kiss after eating fire? "What happens is you burp up gasoline," Ms. Perkins said, laughing. "It's pretty gross." How New York Is Unlike Sarasota         But still exciting for a woman who grew up Sarasota, Fla., where the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus spent its winters and was home to the Ringling Brothers Museum and Clown College. As a child, Ms. Perkins said, she performed in the children's Sailor Circus, along with Emmett Kelly's daughter and a daughter of one of the Flying Wallendas. She specialized in tumbling and riding the unicycle.         Since she didn't have to run away to join the circus, she graduated from high school a year early and ran away from it, to New York at the age of 16: "It seemed so alive compared to the resort-town feel in Sarasota, which catered to vacation living. I loved the chaos in New York, the subways and the dirt. I hung out with a musician boyfriend and modeled for a minute at Wilhelmina. But I wasn't mentally prepared for it, until a few years later."         Ms. Perkins says she has a one-year commitment to the Penn and Teller show, which has been extended on Broadway indefinitely. Then, she said, she plans to split her time between New York and Sarasota, where she wants to establish a women's resource center similar to Hope for Housing in New York, which teaches skills to women on welfare, in rehabilitation programs and recently released from prison. She said her family still lives in Sarasota, where her father is a school principal, and her mother is a painter.         But for now, she is still a model and a fire-eater. At a recent weekend performance full of children, a number of them lined up outside after the show to get the stars' autographs. When Ms. Perkins was spotted near the stage door, a small group of prepubescent boys shyly lined up in front of her, programs in hand. Though she had changed out of her costume, the dress she was wearing was equally low cut. And judging from the looks of rapture on those faces as she bent over to sign the Playbills, the fascination with the falling refrigerator was a thing of the past.         She's getting a kick out of it, too. "It's a once in a lifetime opportunity," she said. "If I had tried to plot it out this way it couldn't have happened. And it really is the perfect part-time job. Because I eat fire a lot better than I type."       
         Hannah Falk Hofheimer, a philanthropist and a major benefactor of Barnard, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 102 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her lawyer, Bernard Gartlir.         Mrs. Hofheimer, a 1909 graduate of Barnard College, taught for five years in the New York public schools before devoting herslf to volunteer work. She was a major benefactor of Barnard and on the occasion of her 90th birthday endowed the Hannah and Henry Hofheimer Scholarship there. She also supported the League of Women Voters, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the United Jewish Appeal and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. Her husband, Henry, a Manhattan lawyer, died in 1975.         She is survived by a son, Joseph, of Scarsdale; a daughter, Babette Sonneborn, also of Scarsdale; 10 grandchildren, and 28 great-grandchildren.       
         Harriet Fleischl Pilpel, a lawyer and civil libertarian who was a prominent advocate of women's rights, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Pilpel died of a heart attack, her husband said.         Last Wednesday, she received an award from the New York Civil Liberties Foundation, one of many such awards she had received. At her death she was first vice chairwoman of the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.         Mrs. Pilpel, a frequent guest on the television program "Firing Line" with William F. Buckley Jr., was associated with the Manhattan law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which she joined in 1982. Throughout her career she lectured extensively on freedom of speech and the press, birth control, abortion and related subjects. She also spoke on the status of women and literary and entertainment law.  Served on Rights Panel         In the 1960's, she was a member of the Kennedy and Johnson Commissions on the Status of Women, serving on the committee on political and civil rights. From 1970 to 1978, she was chairwoman of the Law Panel International of Planned Parenthood Federation. She was also a consultant to the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor from 1965 to 1976 and general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union from 1979 to 1986.         She was also general counsel for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and special counsel for Planned Parenthood of New York City. In 1974, she was a founding member of the Women's Forum, an organization of women of achievement and influence from diverse fields.         In 1961, she argued successfully for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America against a suit asking the Supreme Court to rule on Connecticut laws that would have made it a crime to use birth-control devices or for doctors to advise their use. The Court declined 5 to 4 to rule on the laws.         In 1965, Mrs. Pilpel represented Dr. Benjamin Spock in a free-speech suit over whether advertising in his best-seller "Baby and Child Care," violated the public interest. The court ruled against Dr. Spock, who sought to block the ads.         She graduated from Vassar College in 1932 and received a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School in 1933. She received a law degree from Columbia in 1936.         She is survived by her husband, Irvin B. Schwartz, executive administrator for psychiatry at New York Medical College; two children from a former marriage to Robert C. Pilpel, an executive at the Hudson Guild Settlement House, who died in 1987; a daughter, Judith E. Appelbaum, and a son, Robert H. Pilpel, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Juliette Brudney of Cambridge, Mass., and Ruth Frank of Sanibel, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Emily McLaughlin, an actress who was a star in the television soap opera "General Hospital" for nearly three decades, died of cancer on Friday at her home here. She was 61 years old.         Miss McLaughlin, who portrayed Jessie Brewer, had appeared on the ABC series since its first broadcast, on April 1, 1963. She last appeared Feb. 13.         Miss McLaughlin was born in White Plains and earned a bachelor's degree at Middlebury College in Vermont. Her career included Broadway appearances in "The Frogs of Spring" and "The Lovers."         Survivors include a daughter, Mary Ann Anderson, and a son, Robert Lansing Jr.       
         Lisa Taylor, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design from 1969 to 1987, died on Friday in a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas, said David McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts. She was 58 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mr. McFadden said she died of liver cancer.         The museum's current director, Dianne Pilgrim, said through a spokesman that Mrs. Taylor "had a passionate belief in the importance of design and brought that passion and excitement to the museum."         The museum, in the former Andrew Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st Street, is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It closed in 1963 but reopened in 1976, after Mrs. Taylor played a major role in raising funds to install it in the renovated mansion.         Grace Glueck, The New York Times critic, wrote in 1976, "The museum's far-reaching collection covers 3,000 years of artistic production, but it is also very much in touch with contemporary concerns, such as urban planning and the environment." 'Wallpaper to Bird Cages'         What is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum originated as a part of Cooper Union, which had housed it since 1897. In the 1960's, financial problems led Cooper Union to end its ties with the museum, which by then was what Paul Goldberger, The Times critic, called "one of the world's finest storehouses of objects of design and the decorative arts -- with everything from collections of wallpaper to bird cages."         In 1969, the secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, named her as head of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1972 the Carnegie Corporation donated the mansion, and over the next four years Mrs. Taylor and her staff managed to obtain more than $6 million from private individuals, corporations and foundations.         It was Mrs. Taylor who had the idea for the annual Museum Mile open house and street fair involving museums along upper Fifth Avenue. It was first held in 1979, and 10 museums participated last year.         In 1976, Mrs. Taylor said, "I think we'll be a great success, because we have a superb collection and people are becoming more and more aware of how design relates to the quality of life. And besides, there's a feeling of love for us because we've made it." Edited Design Series         Mr. McFadden said Mrs. Taylor retired in 1987 for reasons of health and to work on the final volumes in a series of books she edited. The series, titled "Immovable Objects," comprises six books of essays by various authorities on the impact of design on daily life. The volumes have separate topics ranging from urban open spaces to the subways.         Mrs. Taylor was born on Jan. 8, 1933, in New York, the daughter of Theo von Bergen-Maier, an architect, and the former Martina Weincerl, a painter.         She studied at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington and at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities.         She was on the staff of the President's Fine Arts Commission in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and membership director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington from 1962 to 1966. She then joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where she helped to devise a highly successful Smithsonian educational program before being named to head the Cooper Union Museum.         She was awarded honorary doctorates by the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.         She is survived by her second husband, Bertrand L. Taylor 3d, who is an investor; their daughter, Lauren, and their son, Lindsay, all of Naples, Fla.

         Tatiana du Plessix Liberman, the leading hat designer for Saks Fifth Avenue for 20 years, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan and Warren, Conn.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Liberman, whose original name was Tatiana Yacovleff, was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 7, 1906, into a professional family that found sanctuary in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. She studied painting and sculpture, but also learned millinery to earn a living.         She was married to a French diplomat, Bertrand de Plessix, from 1929 until 1940 when he was killed by the Germans in their conquest of France.         She fled to New York with their daughter in 1941 and began designing hats for Henri Bendel. Within a year, she joined Saks Fifth Avenue and became head of its custom hat salon, designing with the signature Tatiana du Plessix until its Salon Moderne closed in 1963.         The designs were often praised by fashion reporters as irresistible. In 1950, Virginia Pope of The New York Times hailed the milliner as "a perfectionist" in assembling both materials and colors and for artful originality in flattering women of many types. The 1951 collection, Miss Pope wrote, excells in "both wit and wisdom."         In 1942, the designer married Alexander Liberman, an artist and editorial director of Conde Nast Publications. Mr. Liberman was an adolescent friend and fellow Russian emigre in Paris.         They kept close ties with friends from the Paris days and later with prominent Soviet artists who settled in the West, including Joseph Brodsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The couple's homes were also gathering places for friends like Salvador Dali, John Gunther, Marlene Dietrich and Christian Dior.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Liberman is survived by a daughter, the writer Francine du Plessix Gray, of Warren, Conn., a sister, Lila Duchess of Caylus, France, and two grandsons.       
         Elinor Remick Warren, who composed more than 200 works for orchestra and voice, died at her home on Saturday. She was 91 years old.         Miss Warren was born in Los Angeles, attended Mills College, and studied with musicians in New York and Paris. Her first choral-orchestral work, "The Harp Weaver," was introduced at Carnegie Hall in 1936. Her "Legend of King Arthur" was first performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1940.         Miss Warren's husband, Z. Wayne Griffin, a film producer, died in 1981. She is survived by a daughter, two sons and five grandchildren.       
         Lucy Jane Ford Buhler, former president of the Women's Investment League, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of pnuemonia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Buhler was one of the first female investment brokers at Bache & Company, with whom she was associated in the 1960's. She retired in 1971.         She was also president of The Women's Aid Society of 1844 and a volunteer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's costume institute. She also helped run benefit concerts for the Metropolitan Opera National Council audition for several years.         Her husband, Dr. Curt F. Buhler, keeper of printed books for the Pierpont Morgan Library, died in 1985.         Mrs. Buhler is survived by a daughter, Lucille Ford of Manhattan; two stepsons, Ferdinand Schoettle of Minneapolis, and Michael Schoettle of Rolling Hills, Calif.; two stepdaughters, Joan S. Carville of Point Pleasant, N.J., and Mary Alice Jones-Ohlemann of Lake Oswego, Ore.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Teaze, a Red Cross volunteer whose more than 70 years of service spanned two world wars, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Fairfield, Conn. She was 93 years old and lived in Weston, Conn.         She died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.         Her mother started the Red Cross chapter in her hometown of Bloomfield, N.J. Mrs. Teaze's late husband, Moses, was president of the chapter and of the Westport-Weston chapter after the couple moved to Connecticut in 1950.         She joined the Red Cross at the age of 18, shortly after the start of World War I, and became captain of the motor corps for the chapter in Bloomfield. During the 1920's and 1930's, she continued to transport soldiers to and from hospitals. When World War II began, she became co-captain of the Red Cross Motor Corps. In the 1950's she began helping drives for the newly established Red Cross blood bank. She ceased her volunteer activities in mid-1990.         She is survived by two sons, Allison D., of Little Falls, N.J., and David A., of New Canaan, Conn.; a daughter, Kathryn Clark of Weston; 9 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Marie Jastrow, who wrote two critically praised books describing immigrant life in turn-of-the-century New York, died at her home in Tucson, Ariz., on March 30. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Jastrow was 82 when her first book, "A Time to Remember: Growing Up in New York Before the Great War," was published in 1979 by W. W. Norton. It was followed in 1986 by a sequel, also published by Norton, "Looking Back: The American Dream Through Immigrant Eyes 1907-1918."         Reviewing "A Time to Remember" in The New York Times Book Review, Caroline Seebohm wrote: "This kind of document grows more and more precious with the years. Her vivid descriptions evoke more than just a lost age -- they evoke a certain feeling for America that cannot quite be duplicated."         Mrs. Jastrow was born in the Prussian city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. She lived in Yugoslavia before moving to the United States with her family in 1907, at the age of 10. They settled in the Yorkville area of Manhattan.         In a 1979 interview Mrs. Jastrow recalled: "We enjoyed Yorkville when it was a melting pot for immigrants from all over Europe. It was a wonderful time. People were poor in money, but no one felt poor otherwise.         "We lived on East 81st Street. Fleischmann's Vienna Bakery was next door. It was managed by Raoul Fleischmann, who later became the publisher of The New Yorker. P.S. 96 was across the street."         Mrs. Jastrow said she had been writing since she was a young girl, but had always received rejection slips. "I concentrated on short stories, which I must say are very good," she said.         She is survived by her son, Robert, an astonomer, author and professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College; a daughter, Dorothy Heller of Creston, N.C., and a sister, Yolanda Pesce, of Tucson.       
         Nettie S. Horch, an arts patron and co-founder of the Master Institute of United Arts in New York City, died at the Humana-Biscayne Hospital in North Miami on Monday. She was 94 years old and lived in Hallandale, Fla.         She died of bronchitis, her daughter, Oriole Farb Feshbach, said.         The Master Institute, which began as a music school with a collection of Old Master art works, was founded by Mrs. Horch in 1922 with her husband, Louis. Its purpose was to help bring people together through the arts.         In 1928 the Horches incorporated quarters for the Institute in a 29-story residential skyscraper they built at Riverside Drive and 103d Street. Their aim was to provide an environment of art and culture for apartment dwellers, and they developed the concept that income from the apartments would support the art activities of the Institute. The building contained a 300-seat theater, a non-profit school of fine arts, studio apartments for musicians and dancers, and the Riverside Museum, a small, vanguard institution that became known for showing work that differed from the prevailing currents in the art world.  Equality in Acquisitions         Mrs. Horch became the director of the museum, which not only housed the couple's collection of Tibetan, American, and American Indian art, but mounted many early shows by artists who were later to become well-known, like Louise Nevelson. The museumdevoted a number of shows to the work of women, and under Mrs. Horch's direction, presented in 1939 the first exhibition by the Abstract American Artists, whose work ran against the social realist trend of the time. The museum also gave shows to the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. In 1940 it mounted one of the earliest exhibitions of work by Puerto Rican artists.         As fine arts chairman of the National Council of Women of the United States, from 1937 to 1954, Mrs. Horch was interested in fostering the work of women artists, and mounted a series of group shows devoted to women of various nationalities, among them Japanese, Canadian and Norwegian.         In 1971, after Mrs. Horch and her husband moved to Florida, the museum was closed, and its holdings became the Louis and Nettie Horch Collection at Brandeis University. Mr. Horch died in 1979.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Leonia, N.J. and Amherst, Mass., Mrs. Horch is survived by a brother, Nathan Stone of Lake Worth, Fla., four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

         Bennetta Bullock Washington, an educator and a former director of the Women's Job Corps, died Tuesday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 73 years old and lived in Washington.         Dr. Washington, who was being treated for complications from a stroke, died of cardiac arrest, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Imbued with the desire to educate the poor and culturally deprived, Dr. Washington believed that all children, including poor, black, inner-city youngsters, have potential.         The daughter of a prominent Baptist minister, she was the wife of Walter Washington, the first elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. During his tenure, 1967 to 1979, she was regarded as one of his two top advisers.         She began her teaching career in a special school for disturbed youths called Boys Junior-Senior High. She was named principal of Cardozo High School in 1961, where she initiated an academic and work-study program that became a model for the National Teacher Corps.         In 1964 she started a Job Corps program for women, setting up training centers around the country. In 1973 she became an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Labor, specializing in the education, vocational training and counseling of men and women in urban and rural ghettos. She retired in 1981.         Dr. Washington wrote three books about the effects of poverty on the learning process, was a trustee for several colleges and was a member of Presidential committees on youth, hunger and employment of the handicapped.

         Dr. Frances Fuchs Schachter, a child psychologist, died on Thursday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 61 years old.         She died of lung cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Dr. Schachter's primary interest was in developmental psychology, in work with brothers and sisters, language development in young children and parent-toddler relations.         Since 1983, Dr. Schachter had been supervising pediatric psychologist at Metropolitan Hospital and an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at New York Medical College. She also had a private practice in family therapy.         From 1974 to 1982 she was an assistant professor of psychology at Barnard College, and in the early 1970's she was a pychologist at the Bank Street College of Education. In the 1960's, she was a member of the department of child psychiatry at St. Luke's Hospital.         She was the author of "Everyday Mother Talk to Toddlers: Early Intervention" (Academic Press, 1979), and co-editor with Richard K. Stone of "Practical Concerns About Siblings: Bridging the Research-Practice Gap" (Haworth Press, 1987).

         Friedelind Wagner, a granddaughter of the composer Richard Wagner who won fame for her courageous opposition to Nazism, died early yesterday evening at the Community Hospital in Herdecke, Germany, in the Ruhr. She was 73 years old.         She died of liver disease, said her nephew, Gottfried Wagner.         Miss Wagner, who bore an uncanny resemblance to her grandfather, was born in Bayreuth, Germany, the site of the annual summer Wagner festival. She was educated in Germany and England and at the Sorbonne in Paris.         Her father, Siegfried, whom she adored, died in 1930, along with her grandmother Cosima, who was Franz Liszt's daughter. It was her English-born mother, Winifred, whose fanatic admiration for Adolf Hitler (and Hitler's equally fanatic admiration for Wagner's music) made Bayreuth into a Nazi shrine in the 1930's. Fled the Nazis         Friedelind Wagner, always a rebel, resisted that trend and finally fled Germany in 1940 amid a burst of publicity.         "I was always stubborn and independent," she said in an interview in 1944. "I only had to listen to Hitler rave and rant to be disgusted and horrified."         When war broke out in September 1940, she was visiting in Switzerland. Already an outspoken opponent of Nazism, she realized that the protection she had enjoyed as a member of the Wagner family would no longer guarantee her safety. Although offered asylum in Britain, she was interned by bureaucratic accident for three months. Toscanini's Intercession         Released at the intercession of the conductor Arturo Toscanini, another outspoken anti-Fascist, she came to the United States in 1942 after detours to Uruguay and Argentina. During the war she remained an active anti-Nazi propagandist, a particular embarassment for the Nazis, given their idolatry of Wagner.         Miss Wagner's career after 1945 was a checkered one. She wrote a lively autobiography, "Heritage of Fire," but her only real ally in the Wagner family was her brother Wieland. His brilliant career as a stage director and designer and co-director of the Bayreuth Festival was cut short by his death in 1966.         Until then Miss Wagner had directed the Bayreuth Festival Master Classes, a summerlong series of workshops and instruction for young singers, conductors, directors and critics. After Wieland's death, the hostility shown her by her mother and her brother Wolfgang turned her later years into a gypsylike odyssey as she fruitlessly attempted to find support for her dream of a theatrical academy.         She lived in northern England for a number of years, then attempted to relocate to Bayreuth and spent her final years in Lucerne.         She is survived by her brother Wolfgang, of Bayreuth, and a sister, Verena Lafferentz, of Uberlingen, Germany.       
         Wally Toscanini, a daughter of Arturo Toscanini who was known in Italy for her charitable works, died yesterday at the home of her daughter in Rome. She was 91 years old and had lived in Rome in recent years.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her sister, Wanda Horowitz of Manhattan.         One of Toscanini's three children, Walter, Wally and Wanda, she lived most of her life in Milan. She devoted much of her time to raising money for orphaned children throughout Italy and for restoring La Scala, where her father was the principal conductor for many years.         Her marriage to Count Emanuele di Castelbarco in 1931 ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, the widow of the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, she is survived by her daughter, Emanuela Castelbarco, and a grandson.       
         Alice Fetzer Carse, a professor of comparative humanities at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, L.I., died on Wednesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 59 years old.         She died of cancer, her daughter said.         A linguist, translator and specialist in dramatic literature, she was chairwoman of the comparative humanities department from 1975 to 1976 and again from 1986 to 1987. She received the Governor's Award for Distinguished Teaching in 1985.         She traveled extensively in Western Europe and India, lived and studied in Mexico and Nicaragua, and taught English and German at Kangreung National University in Korea in 1985.         Dr. Carse was born in Adolzhausen, Germany, and came to the United States in 1949. She graduated from Bucknell University, received a Master of Divinity degree from Yale University and a doctorate in German literature from New York University. She taught at Yale and at Drew University before joining SUNY in 1973.         She is survived by her husband, James Carse, a professor of religion at New York University; her daughter, Alisa, a professor of philosophy at Georgetown University, and two sons, Keene and James, both professional musicians, of Manhattan. Two sisters and two brothers also survive.       
         Emily Coolidge Stone, a former director of membership at the Museum of Modern Art, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         She died after a stroke, her daughter said.         Before joining the museum in 1947 she was a research assistant for the Office of Strategic Services.         Mrs. Stone, who attended Radcliffe College, was a director of the France-America Society and a member of the Museum of Modern Art International Council and the International Council of Museums.         A widow, she is survived by her daughter, Edith Woodruff Kunhardt of Manhattan, four grandchildren and four great-granchildren.       
         Heidi Bruehl, an actress and singer, died on Saturday in a hospital at this resort near Munich. She was 49 years old.         The cause of death was not immediately known, said her agent, Carla Rehm.

Born in Munich, Miss Bruehl began her movie career at the age of 12. She appeared in more than 20 films in West Germany, including "The Confessions of Felix Krull." She also became a popular recording star in her native country.         From 1970 to 1972, she starred in shows in Las Vegas, Nev., and later founded a film company with her husband, Brett Halsey.         After the couple divorced, Miss Bruehl began producing records. She returned to West Germany, where she acted in several television series.         She is survived by a son and a daughter.       
         Ruth Hornby Page, an educator and former executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, died on Sunday at Jupiter (Fla.) Hospital.

Mrs. Page, a 1932 graduate of Montclair State College, taught English at Park Ridge High School and Fairleigh Dickinson University before joining the staff of the School Boards Association in 1957. She led the 604-member organization until she retired in 1971.         Mrs. Page was a member of many educational organizations.         She is survived by her husband, H. Clifford Page; a son, Ronald, of Burke, Va.; a daughter, Lois Drew of Manhattan; a sister, Alice LeGrand of Fair Lawn, N.J., and five grandchildren.

         Elizabeth Sorel, a former fashion model, died Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Sorel died of complications from leukemia, said her daughter, Claudette.         In the 1920's and early 1930's, Mrs. Sorel was one of the most sought-after models in Paris, modeling for members of the haute couture like Jean Patou, Jacques Fath and Chanel. A native of Budapest, she came to the United States in the early 1940's and, with her husband, operated Sorel Belt Creations in Manhattan. The store was later sold. She also worked for Saks Fifth Avenue as an accessories designer for Sophie Gibel.         With her husband, Michel, who died in 1989, Mrs. Sorel operated the Shelton Apartments Inc., a real estate firm in Manhattan, from 1947 to her death.         She is survived by a daughter, Claudette, a concert pianist and a professor of music at the State University of New York at Fredonia, of Manhattan.       
         Vera Yarrow, a teacher in the New York City public school system and a diction coach to singrs and actors, died yesterday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Yarrow, the mother of the singer Peter Yarrow of the group Peter, Paul and Mary, died of leukemia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She taught English, speech and drama at various public schools, among them the Julia Richman High School in Manhattan, Walton High School in the Bronx, and Girls' Commercial High School in Brooklyn. She also lectured at Hunter College and coached singers and actors privately.         Mrs. Yarrow was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1903 and came to the United States three years later. She was a graduate of Hunter College and did postgraduate work at Columbia University.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Elena Mezzetti of Perugia, Italy; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Eva Le Gallienne, who as an actress, producer, director, translator, writer and teacher was for many decades one of the grand figures of the American stage, died late Monday night at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 92 years old.         The cause of death was heart failure, said a friend, Anne Kaufman Schneider.         A commanding presence on the stage and a strong-minded director, Miss Le Gallienne was actually a slight and, according to her friends, a shy and private person, her affections being concentrated on her dogs and other pets. In a memoir, she expressed surprise at being called beautiful by critics; she said she thought beauty might be a burden.         She was dedicated to the theater from early childhood, two aunts and an uncle having been successful English actors. She was born in London on Jan. 11, 1899, the daughter of Richard Le Gallienne, a then-famous poet and journalist, and the former Julie Norregard, a Danish journalist. Her parents were divorced when Eva was 4 years old, and she and her mother moved to Paris. Saw Bernhardt Act         There, as a young girl, she saw Sarah Bernhardt act, and was taken backstage to meet the star. The experience was to determine the course of Miss Le Gallienne's own life.         "It made such an enormous impression on me that I thought, 'That's what I'd like to do,' " she said.         Eva was 15 when Constance Collier, a family friend, got her a walk-on role in Maeterlinck's "Monna Vanna" in London. She attended a drama school for a few months, but left for a part as a cockney servant girl in a minor comedy -- and brought down the house.         On the strength of rave reviews and encouragement from theater folk, Miss Le Gallienne and her mother left wartime London in 1915 for New York. Her bright expectations were not immediately realized. The first two plays in which she found work were failures, and she was dismissed from the cast of another play during its out-of-town tryouts. She spent a season on the road and in summer stock.  First Success         Finally, at the age of 20, she enjoyed her first big success, opposite Sidney Blackmer in Arthur Richman's "Not So Long Ago." This was followed by a still greater hit in 1921 with Joseph Schildkraut in the Theater Guild's production of Molnar's "Liliom."         In 1923, she had another hit in the star role in "The Swan" by Molnar. During its long run in 1923 and again in 1924-25, she became obsessed with the need for a repertory theater.         "Miss Le G.," as generations of theater people called her, came closer than any other person to endowing the United States with a permanent company performing repertory in the manner of the Old Vic, the Comedie Francaise and the Moscow Art Theater.         Without any government subsidy, she very nearly realized her dream. Willingly abandoning a career as a Broadway star in 1926, she founded the Civic Repertory Theater and staged classics at popular prices that filled the old 14th Street Theater for six seasons.         The Civic Rep's production of "Peter Pan," with the actress sailing to the balcony on an invisible wire, enchanted masses of children, and Josephine Hutchinson as "Alice in Wonderland" with Miss Le Gallienne as the White Queen enchanted grownups as well.         Among the company's apprentices were such hopeful novices as Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, J. Edward Bromberg and Howard Da Silva.         But although the Civic Repertory played in the main to full houses, the box office, with a top ticket price of $1.50, never quite met its budget. The company's wealthy patrons were hit by the Depression, donations dwindled and the theater closed in 1933. By then it had given 1,581 performances of 34 plays -- 32 of which Miss Le Gallienne had directed. She also acted in a majority of the plays.         At the end of the 1930-31 season, Miss Le Gallienne was severely burned in the explosion of a gasoline stove at her country home in Weston. The use of her hands was only partly restored in a series of operations, but she so mastered the handicap that few in her audiences perceived it.         After a series of operations on her crippled hands, she directed and starred on Broadway in Rostand's "L'Aiglon" with Ethel Barrymore.  'Rather Play Ibsen Than Eat'         After its long run, Miss Le Gallienne performed the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" in vaudeville, and translated, staged and acted in Ibsen's "Rosmersholm." It failed, using up her financial reserves. Long afterward, she wrote, "I would rather play Ibsen than eat -- and that's often just what it amounts to."         With her longtime companion, the late actress Marion Evensen, she moved to the estate at Weston, which she had bought at a prosperous time in 1926. There, with barnyard and forest creatures, cats and a kennel of cairn terriers, she busily gardened, wove, wrote and studied for the rest of her life -- but never abandoned the theater.         She lectured at colleges, toured frequently in plays and realized a youthful ambition by playing "Hamlet," in a summer production that she staged with the young Uta Hagen as Ophelia. For the Theater Guild, she directed a series of revivals at popular prices.         During the war years, the actress also toured for the Guild as Mrs. Malaprop in "The Rivals" and returned to Broadway as a star opposite Joseph Schildkraut in two successes: "Uncle Harry" by Thomas Job and a new "Cherry Orchard." She had also produced the play and helped to translate it.         With Margaret Webster and Cheryl Crawford, Miss Le Gallienne helped organize the American Repertory Theater in 1946, but the reviews were mixed, the costs were high and the three leaders did not always agree. The first season was the last.         In 1958, her television production of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey" was described by Jack Gould, the New York Times critic, as "unforgettable" and her part as "acting at its supreme best." Played Queen Elizabeth         Another memorable role was her performance as Queen Elizabeth in Schiller's "Mary Stuart," which she did on stage across the country periodically from 1957 through 1962, and also on television.         As translator, director and a star of Chekhov's "Seagull" in 1964, Miss Le Gallienne received from Adlai E. Stevenson the award of the American National Theater and Academy. She got another ANTA award on her 78th birthday in 1977.         She was then on tour, in "The Royal Family." The revival of the Edna Ferber-George S. Kaufman comedy based on the Barrymore family was a hit of the 1976 Broadway season and a triumph for Miss Le Gallienne, who played the mother of the tribe, skipping girlishly upstairs in Act I and descending like an elderly queen in Act III.         As a result of her work in "The Royal Family," she received New York City's cultural award, the Handel Medallion, and the observation by the actress Rosemary Harris:         "If you listen to Miss Le G., you can hear 15 shades of meaning in 15 syllables."         In 1981 Miss Le Gallienne returned to Broadway in "To Grandmother's House We Go," which ran for only 61 performances. Returned as White Queen         But her enthusiasm for her next Broadway project was boundless, since it involved her co-directing a late 1982 revival of her beloved "Alice in Wonderland" and again assuming the role of the White Queen. It, too, however, was a flop, closing after 21 regular performances.         In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Arts.         Miss Le Gallienne traveled everywhere for many years with a two-pound Yorkshire terrier, Nana, in a little basket.         After observing two barnyard hens, she wrote a children's book, "Flossie and Bossie: A Moral Tale." She also translated "Seven Tales by Hans Christian Andersen" and wrote a bio graphy, "The Mystic in the Theater: Eleonora Duse" (1966).         Stagestruck to the end, she once recalled a young woman complaining that she had never seen Sarah Bernhardt, Sacha Guitry, Isadora Duncan or Duse. "I thought to myself," Miss Le Gallienne said, " 'I wouldn't change places with you for anything; not even to be 20 again!' "         There are no survivors.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Anita Hart Balter, an artist and writer well known for her role in fostering the arts in the Hudson Valley, died on June 29 at her home in Garrison, N.Y.         Mrs. Balter, who was 57 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., died of complications from breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Her activities were directed at both art and broader community development. She was the founder and operator of Gallery Forecast, now defunct, in Peekskill, in which well-known sculptors chose emerging talent for exhibition to draw the attention of the many corporate headquarters in the region.         Mrs. Balter, who was born in Amsterdam and moved to the United States with her family just before World War II, was also on the board of the Garrison Art Center, where she established a Scholarship and Mentor Program in which artists worked with promising local pupils. In 1987 she was a founding board member of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival.         She is survived by her husband, Lee; her mother, Jenny Hart; a brother, Herbert Hart of Monte Carlo, Monaco; and, by a former marriage, a daughter, Elise Hart of Berkeley, Calif., and two sons, Michael Sheffrin of Majorca, and Ivan Sheffrin of Washington, and a grandson.       
         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.

         Mimi Schnall, a Westchester County Democratic committeewoman, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 57 years old and lived in Greenburgh, N.Y.         Mrs. Schnall died of gall bladder cancer, her husband said.         She was elected first vice chairwoman of the Westchester Democratic Committee in 1986. She was also a former chairwoman of the Town of Greenburgh Democratic Committee for many years, a delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention in Manhattan and the Westchester County coordinator for Mario M. Cuomo's first campaign for governor.         Beginning in 1974, Mrs. Schnall was director of volunteers for the Westchester Lighthouse, a local subsidiary of the New York Lighthouse for the Blind, for 17 years.         She is survived by her husband, Albert, executive vice president of Complus Data Innovations Inc. in Hawthorne, N.Y.; a daughter, Lisa Schnall of Brooklyn; three sons, Michael, of White Plains, David, of Bedford, N.Y. and Peter, of Washington; a brother, Dr. Robert Ascheim of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Patricia Robbins Beatty, an award-winning author of 50 children's books, died on Tuesday at the Riverside (Calif.) Community Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in Riverside.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Beatty's books were generally admired for their evocation of both the humor and the harsh realities of the American West in the 19th century. Her more recent novels, including "Charley Skedaddle" (1987), which won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, dealt with the Civil War.         She was born in Portland, Ore., and spent much of her childhood in the Northwest, sometimes living on Indian reservations. She graduated from Reed College in Portland and became a children's librarian and a high school teacher of English and history.         She began to write when her children were small and drew on her knowledge of the Quileute Indians for her first book, "The Indian Canoe Maker," published in 1960 by Caxton Press. Eleven books that followed were written in collaboration with her first husband, Dr. John L. Beatty, a professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, who died in 1975.         In 1974, she received an award for a distinguished body of work from the Southern California Council on Children's Literature. In 1988, she established the John and Patricia Beatty Award through the California Library Association to encourage the writing of children's books about the culture and heritage of California.         A forthcoming book, "Jayhawker," the story of a young abolitionist during the Civil War, is to be published by Morrow Junior Books in October.         She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Carl Uhr, a professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside; a daughter, Alexandra Beatty, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Frankenthaler Feldon, the first woman to become a trustee of Congregation Emanu-El in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her daughter said.         Mrs. Feldon was named a trustee of Congregation Emanu-El in May 1957 and remained in the post until 1967.         She was born in Manhattan, the daughter of George Frankenthaler, a State Supreme Court justice, and Marion Hendricks Frankenthaler. She graduated from Vassar College in 1939.         Her first husband, Richard Lewisohn Jr., died in 1976, and her second husband, Richard Feldon, died in 1988.         She is survived by three children from her first marriage: a daughter, Aileen Godsick of Manhattan, and two sons, Richard Lewisohn 3d of Manhattan and Clifford Lewisohn of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Anne F. Kohn of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Lee Remick, the elegant actress who illumined dozens of films and many stage and television plays, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 55 years old.         The actress died of cancer after fighting the disease for two years, a spokesman for the family said. In one of her last public appearances, a star was dedicated in her honor in April on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.         Ms. Remick, an uncommonly versatile performer, portrayed characters as disparate as a seductive cheerleader and a tormented alcoholic, along with such historical figures as Lady Randolph Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt.         Once billed as "America's answer to Brigitte Bardot," she was as much admired for her acting abilities as for her bubbly attractiveness. Writing in The New York Times of her performance in the 1980 television movie "The Women's Room," John J. O'Connor said, "Lee Remick proves once again she is an uncommonly gifted actress whose somewhat fragile, almost stereotyped good looks tend to distract one from that fact."         Ms. Remick, who was born in Quincy, Mass., studied dance as a child and won her first acting job at age 16 with a summer-stock company on nearby Cape Cod. This led to a part in a short-lived Broadway comedy, "Be Your Age," in 1953, several more summer-theater appearances and a string of television roles on "Philco Playhouse," "Hallmark Hall of Fame," "Playhouse 90" and other programs in the mid-1950's. 'I Chucked School'         Later in her career, when asked about her decision to give up school in favor of acting, she said: "I'd cut classes to go to rehearsals, then stay up all night studying, but it wasn't working, and one day a very kind teacher advised me to choose one or the other. I guess the strain was showing. Anyway, it was an easily made decision. I chucked school, told my parents and then slept for 10 days."         After the director Elia Kazan cast Ms. Remick as a seductive cheerleader in his 1957 film, "A Face in the Crowd," she gave highly praised performances in Martin Ritt's "Long Hot Summer" (1958), Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) and Mr. Kazan's "Wild River" (1960). Her portrait of a happily married housewife turned alcoholic in Blake Edwards's "Days of Wine and Roses" (1963) brought her an Academy Award nomination. Subsequent film roles included "Baby the Rain Must Fall" (1965), "Loot" (1972), "Sometimes a Great Notion" (1972) and "The Europeans" (1979).         She chose her roles with care. "After 'Anatomy,' in which I played a kind of tramp, for instance, I could have followed up with more of the same," she told an interviewer. "Reinforcing my 'image' by becoming a sex symbol would have been one way to be more strongly identified as a star, but I had no interest in doing that. I can't be something I'm not." On Broadway and Television         Ms. Remick's most successful Broadway performance was in Frederick Knott's 1966 thriller, "Wait Until Dark," about a blind woman at the mercy of three criminals. Her other stage credits included "Anyone Can Whistle," the 1964 musical by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim, and a Boston production of John Pielmeier's play "Agnes of God" in 1982.         Ms. Remick was a frequent star in television mini-series in the 1970's and 80's. She played the title role in "Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill" (1975) and also starred in "Ike" (1979), "Haywire" (1980), "Toughlove" (1985) and "Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder" (1987).         Reviewing Ms. Remick's performance in "Nutcracker," a 1987 NBC mini-series in which she played a woman who manipulates her son into committing murder, Mr. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times: "If she had been born with Bette Davis eyes or Katharine Hepburn cheekbones, she might long ago have been recognized as one of this country's most outstanding dramatic actresses."  Of Preparation and Humility         Ms. Remick was known to prepare intensively for her roles, attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for her work in "Days of Wine and Roses" and spending a month of blindfolded mornings at New York's Lighthouse for the Blind before starring in "Wait Until Dark."         "I'm really a housewife who is incidentally an actress," Ms. Remick told an interviewer. On another occasion she said: "People tell me that I have a special quality in films, but if I do I take no intellectual credit for it. It's pure instinct. I think I've held on to certain qualities within myself which have been strong."         Ms. Remick's marriage to William A. Colleran, a producer and director, ended in divorce in 1969. Her survivors include her husband of 21 years, Kip Gowans, a producer; a daughter, Kate Colleran Sullivan; a son, Matthew Remick Colleran; two stepdaughters, Justine Gowans Solly and Nicola Gowans, and her mother, Pat Packard.         Correction:  July 29, 1991, Monday         An obituary on July 3 about the actress Lee Remick omitted one of her survivors. He is her brother Bruce Waldo Remick of Springfield, Va.       
         Carol Rubinstein Schickel, a television producer and theatrical lighting designer, died on Saturday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Richard Schickel, the film critic. .         As a husband-and-wife team, Ms. Rubinstein and Mr. Schickel co-produced several television specials, including "Minnelli on Minnelli: Liza Remembers Vincente" for the Public Broadcasting Service and "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" for Turner Network Television. She also co-produced the filmed sequences for the last two Academy Award broadcasts.         Ms. Rubinstein was born in Troy, Ohio, and received a Master of Arts from the Yale Drama School. She was a lighting designer for several regional theaters, including the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival and the Whole Theater Company of Montclair, N.J. Her Off Broadway credits include such shows as "Now Is the Time" and "The Last Sweet Days of Isaac." On Broadway she was the assistant lighting designer for "Jesus Christ, Superstar," "Pippin" and a 1982 revival of "Othello."         Her first marriage, to Arthur B. Rubinstein, a composer, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Charlotte Foy, of Troy; a daughter, Alexandra Rubinstein, of Pasadena, Calif., and two step-daughters, Erika Schickel, of Los Angeles, and Jessica Schickel, of Northampton, Mass.       
         Clara Parker, who was the daughter of the founder of the Concord Resort Hotel in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y., and who took an active part in its development and interior design, died on Sunday at her home in Kiamesha Lake. She was 74 years old.         Mrs. Parker died of the effects of a stroke suffered a year ago, a family spokesman said.         Her husband, Raymond, is chairman of the resort in the Catskills, the nation's largest independently owned family resort hotel.         Mrs. Parker became interested in breeding and raising cattle in the 1930's after meeting Henry A. Wallace, then the Secretary of Agriculture. With Mr. Wallace's help, she experimented in genetics in the raising of the brown Swiss breed. She continued her efforts at the family's farm in Grahamsville, N.Y., and more recently at its 10,000-acre ranch at Rancho Arroyo Grande in California.         Mrs. Parker is survived by her husband, Raymond; a brother, Jules Winarick of Southampton, L.I.; three sons, Robert and James, of Kiamesha Lake, and George, of Tuxedo Park, N.Y.; two daughters, Naomi Friedman of Purchase, N.Y., and Laurie Parker of Kiamesha Lake; 10 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Sylvia Scribner, a psychologist on the faculty of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Scribner died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Dr. Scribner's research centered on cultural influences on learning and development. One of her best-known projects involved studying the literacy of the Vai people of western Liberia, who invented an original writing system. She detailed her research in a book, "The Psychology of Literacy," for which she received the Melville J. Herskovitz Award from the African Studies Association in 1982.         Before joining the faculty of the CUNY Graduate School in 1981, Dr. Scribner was a research scientist at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington and, from 1978 to 1979, was associate director of the National Institute of Education. From 1970 to 1978 she was senior research associate at Rockefeller University.         She graduated from Smith College in 1944 and earned a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in 1970. She began her career as research director for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America in Newark.         Her husband, David Scribner, a lawyer, died in April.         She is survived by a son, Oliver, of Vancouver, B.C.; a daughter, Aggie Kapelman of Manhattan; three step-daughters, Toni Scribner of St. James, N.Y., Wendy Scribner of Manhattan and Nancy Jaslow of Abington, Pa., and two grandsons.       
         Florence Cohen, president emeritus of the Volunteers for Israel, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Cohen died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She had been active with the Volunteers of Israel since its founding in 1982. The organization sends volunteers from the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America to Israel to work in a civilian capacity on military bases and in kibbutzes. It is an offshoot of an 1982 volunteer drive that was established to alleviate shortages created by the war in Lebanon.         Mrs. Cohen, a native of Ramsey, N.J., was a registered nurse who got her nursing degree in 1943. She left nursing to raise a family but returned to the profession in the early 1970's, most recently working at the now defunct Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jules Cohen, a New York cardiologist; two sons, David, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Linda, of Boston, and three grandchildren.       
         Ruth F. Corcoran, who became the first woman to be elected to a Suffolk County town board when she won a seat as a councilwoman in Huntington, L.I., in 1961, died on Friday at the Hilaire Farms Nursing Home in Huntington. She was 81 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a daughter said.         Mrs. Corcoran was a councilwoman from 1961 to 1965. She was also the founder of the Huntington Youth Bureau and served as chairwoman of the Suffolk County Youth Board.         Her husband, Charles R.

She is survived by four daughters, Lucille Buergers of Hampton Bays, L.I., Mary Ehmann of Winnetka, Ill., Jean Schott of Alexandria, Va., and Ruth Ann Howley of Piscataway, N.J.; a son, Charles A., of Des Moines; 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Rachelle Goldberg, a retired New York psychiatrist, died on Wednesday at her room in the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and had lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Goldberg died of natural causes, said her daughter, Alla.         She was born in Dnepropetrovsk, Russia, and graduated from medical school in Moscow in 1923. She came to the United States in 1924 and received her medical license in New York in 1933.         Dr. Goldberg opened a private practice in Brooklyn and was associated with various hospitals, among them Brooklyn Women's Hospital, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and Maimonedes Hospital in Brooklyn. She also worked for the city's well-baby clinics for 30 years. She retired in 1972.         Her husband, Johann, a music teacher, died in 1967.         She is survived by a daughter, Alla Goldberg of Manhattan; a sister, Freyda of Dnepropetrovsk, U.S.S.R.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Alline Elizabeth Davis, a past director of the Gramercy Park Neighborhood Association who was active in community affairs, died on June 18 at her son's home in Vista, Calif. She was 83 years old and until recently lived in the Gramercy Park section of Manhattan.         Mrs. Davis died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a spokeswoman for the family said.         In 1987 she founded and was director of a program, known as Help Our Neighbors Eat Year-Round, to collect cans of food at supermarkets in the Gramercy Park area for distribution to the needy elderly. In 1981 she founded the 22d Steet Association.         Her husband, Hermon Davis, a musician, died in 1965.         In addition to her son, Del, Mrs. Davis is survived by a daughter, Mona Shorey of Sutter Creek, Calif.; a brother, Edward Ponder of Chicago; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.       
         Gisela Warburg Wyzanski, a leader in Zionist women's and youth activities for several decades, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 79 years old.         She died of leukemia, her famlly said.         Mrs. Wyzanski was a longtime national board member of Hadassah, the American women's Zionist organization, and worked in Berlin in the Hitler era with Youth Aliah, a group that resettled Jewish children in Palestine and other countries.         She was born in Hamburg and came to the United States as a refugee in 1939. She served for a quarter century as chairman for the Boston area of the greeting-card fund-raising campaign for Unicef.         Her husband, Charles E. Wyzanski, a former chief judge of Federal District Court in Boston, whom she married in 1943, died in 1986. She is survived by a son, Charles M. Wyzanski of Cambridge, a daughter, Anita Robboy of Cambridge; a sister, Anita Warburg of Manhattan, and four granddaughters.

         Marguerite Feinstein, founder and director of the retiree division of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 23,000 municipal workers in New York City, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 57 years old and lived in Clinton Corners, N.Y.         Mrs. Feinstein, who was known as Maggie, was the wife of Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said Frank Mazza, a spokesman for the union.         Under the Local 237 retiree program, which Mrs. Feinstein founded in 1980, more than 5,000 members participate in classes, community projects and political activities as well as the customary social activities, trips and health-care seminars offered by labor unions. The program has become a model for teamster locals across the country and for locals of other unions.         Mrs. Feinstein was born in Milton, N.Y., and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Marist College. Before joining Local 237, she was director of legislation and political education for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in New York State.         Mrs. Feinstein's older son by a previous marriage, John Dakin, who lived in Poughkeepsie, died of a heart attack on July 23. In addition to Mr. Feinstein, she is survived by her younger son, Patrick Dakin of Poughkeepsie; a daughter, Colleen Trogisch of Pleasant Valley, N.Y.; and two granddaughters.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Brandee Erlanger, a volunteer and fund-raiser for the United Nations for more than 30 years, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a stroke, her husband, Jack, said.         Mrs. Erlanger, a native New Yorker, first became active at the United Nations in Volunteer Services, now known as Staff Activities. She was an officer and past president of the United Nations Hospitality Committee and often headed its fund-raising galas.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Erlanger is survived by a daughter, Peri, of Manhattan; two sisters, Lillian Picoult of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Rose Finkelstein of Ellenville, N.Y., and four brothers, Ruby Mayer of Lakewood, N.J., Harvey and Murray, both of Fort Lauderdale, and Leonard, of Hauppauge, L.I.       
         Erma Campbell, an actress in theater, television and films, died on Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 49 years old.         She died of cancer, said Margo Britton, a friend of the family.         Ms. Campbell appeared in a number of Off Broadway and regional theater productions. In 1990, she won praise for her portrayal of a blues singer in "Ground People," an Off Broadway play about a black minstrel troupe in the 1920's.         She appeared on television in the soap operas "The Guiding Light" and "All My Children," and had a small role in the Woody Allen film "Zelig."         She is survived by her mother, Addie Hutchins of Los Angeles; two sons, Darrin and Raymond, and a daughter, Tracey, all of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Katheryn Hait Dorflinger Manchee, a historian and lecturer whose specialty was glass, died on Wednesday in North Naples Hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 86 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, June Dorflinger Hardy.         Mrs. Manchee was a historian for the Steuben Glass Company in the 1940's and later was a representative for the Swedish glass concern Orrefors.         In addition to her daughter, of Naples, she is survived by three stepdaughters, Marilyn M. Wortman of Montclair, N.J.; Cynthia D. Brown of Darien, Conn., and Sally M. Batchelder of Weston, Mass.       
         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Eva Bertrand Adams, a gold miner's daughter who presided over the United States Mint for eight years, died Friday at a hospital in Reno. Miss Adams was 80 years old and lived in Reno.         The funeral home said she died of natural causes.         Miss Adams was born in Wonder, Nev., a gold-mining town that died when the gold ran out. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada and a master's degree in English from Columbia University.         She taught high school English in Las Vegas before returning to the University of Nevada as an instructor in 1936. She also served as assistant dean of women at the university before beginning a new career in 1940 as the principal aide to Senator Pat McCarran, Republican of Nevada, in Washington.         She continued as administrative assistant to Mr. McCarran until he died in 1954, then served under his interim successor and under Senator Alan Bible, a Democrat elected as Mr. McCarran's permanent replacement.         While working for Senator McCarran, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she received an bachelor of laws degree from George Washington University in 1948 and a doctor of laws degree from the university two years later. She became a member of the bar in her home state and in the District of Columbia, as well as of the Supreme Court bar.         In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named her director of the Mint.         During her tenure, Miss Adams authorized and supervised the construction of a new mint in Philadelphia and the expansion of the Denver Mint. She also battled an acute nationwide coin shortage in the early 1960's that was caused by hoarding and a proliferation of coin-operated vending machines.         President Lyndon B. Johnson reappointed her in 1966 and she retired from the post in September 1969 for yet another career, as a management consultant in Reno.         Miss Adams left no immediate survivors.       
         Joan D. Abrams, a former superintendent of schools in Red Bank, N.J., and a leader in the movement to open doors for women in school administration, died on Sunday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. She was 62 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J.         Dr. Abrams died of breast cancer, her son, Linus, said.         As an educator, one of Dr. Abrams's concerns was advancing early detection of learning problems. In the Red Bank school system, where she was superintendent from 1974 to 1987, she began a systematic way for a teacher to determine how much a student had learned. She lectured nationally on this method, called mastery learning.         Before going to Red Bank, Dr. Abrams was superintendent of schools in Montvale, N.J. In New York City, where she began her career, she was principal of Public School 165, assistant principal of Public School 41 and a teacher at Public School 192.         Dr. Abrams received her Ph.D. in education administration from New York University in 1971. When she moved into administration, she was one of a few women in the nation in the top echelons of administration. To help change this, she founded the National Women's Caucus of the American Association of School Administrators.         Besides her son, Dr. Linus Abrams of Brookline, Mass., Dr. Abrams is survived by her husband, Nathan, and a daughter, Lydia, of New York City.       
         Ruth G. Schapiro, a nationally known tax lawyer and a partner in the New York firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Donald Schapiro, her husband of 39 years, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Schapiro, a native of Manhattan, was a 1947 graduate of Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where she was notes editor of the Law Review. She went to work in 1951 at the firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and joined the Proskauer firm in 1955.         President Carter appointed Mrs. Schapiro to the Tax Court Nominating Commission in 1978, and she served as a member of the panel until 1981. At the time of her death, she was chairwoman of the committee on personal income taxes of the New York City State Bar Association.         She was a past chairwoman of the state bar's tax section, as well as of its finance committee, and served on the executive committee of the state bar's House of Delegates. From 1984 to 1989, she also headed a special committee on women in the courts set up by the state bar.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Schapiro's survivors include a daughter, Jane G., also of Manhattan; a son, Robert A., of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of United States District Court in Manhattan.       
         Miss Southern's recordings include "You Better Go Now," "When I Fall in Love," "An Occasional Man" and "Fire Down Below," which she sang in the Rita Hayworth film of the same name in 1957. That song made it to the top-10 spot on the pop-music charts.         Miss Southern, whose name was originally Genevieve Hering, was born in Royal, Neb. She began playing the piano as a child, and she trained as a classical pianist. She moved to Chicago in the mid-1940's. To support herself, she worked as a cocktail pianist, and built a reputation as a pop singer. She was signed by Decca Records, which released her first single in 1951.         In the late 1960's, Miss Southern stopped performing publicly and began teaching vocal and piano technique to others in the profession. She continued to write and arrange songs, and published a book, "Interpreting Popular Music at the Keyboard."         Miss Southern had been divorced for more than 10 years from the jazz musician Bill Holman, but she continued to use that last name privately. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Barbara Ewing Ylvisaker, a registered nurse who in the 1960's helped to create one of the nation's first federally financed neighborhood health centers, in Trenton, died Sunday at New England Baptist Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 66 years old.         Her husband, Paul, said she died of cancer.

She died of breast cancer, family members said.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Carr was one of several female law students who filed sex discrimination claims against several large law firms. The suits were settled by the firms' adoption of procedures to assure equal opportunities in hiring for future generations of law students.         Ms. Carr had been litigation counsel for Warner Communications, now Time Warner, since 1981. She was a graduate of Vassar College and of Columbia Law School, and she had received a master's degree in political science from New York University.

         Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, great-aunt of King Hussein of Jordan and an artist best known as an abstract painter of the Paris School in the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday after a short illness. She was 89 years old.         During an artistic career that spanned more than 60 years, the princess blended elements of Islamic and Byzantine art with abstract and other influences from the West. She had exhibitions in major galleries in Paris, London and New York City.         The princess was born in 1901 in Istanbul to a prominent Ottoman family that included many artists. She began painting at the age of 14 and was one of the first women to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul.         In 1934 she married King Hussein's great-uncle Prince Zeid el Hussein, a diplomat serving as a minister plenipotentiary in Turkey for his brother King Faisal I of Iraq. He died in 1970.         She is survived by a son, Prince Raad bin Zeid, and two children from a previous marriage: another son, Nejad Devrim of Warsaw, a painter, and a daughter, Sirin Devrim Trainer of New York City, an actress.       
         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Jane Dewey Ellsworth, founder of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation, died last Friday at her home in Westlake Village, Calif., near Los Angeles. She was 80 years old.         Her family said the cause of death was emphysema.         Mrs. Ellsworth, a native of Greenfield, Mass., studied speech and drama at Smith College and had a brief stage career in stock and in bit parts on Broadway. She was under contract to Paramount Studios for two years and, at the time, wrote some magazine fiction.         She was married for a time to Patric Farrell, who in the 1920's and 30's was director of the Irish Theater at Sheridan Square and an Irish arts museum in Manhattan. In 1938, after they had divorced, she married Whitney Ellsworth, writer and producer of the old "Superman" television series.         The Ellsworths were living in Greenwich, Conn., in the early 1950's when her 15-year-old daughter by her first marriage, Patricia, developed myasthenia gravis. Mrs. Ellsworth's concern with the nerve disorder, which is characterized by muscular weakness and fatigue, especially in the face and the neck, prompted her to form the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation. The foundation, organized in New York in 1952, now has headquarters in Chicago and has 53 chapters around the country.         Mrs. Ellsworth's daughter, a Barnard College graduate and former editor for the Encyclopedia Americana in New York, is now Patricia Wilson, a resident of Holland, Mich. Mrs. Ellsworth's first husband, Mr. Farrell, lives in Manhattan. There are no other immediate survivors.       
         Hallie Burnett Zeisel, a novelist, college teacher and co-editor of Story magazine from 1942 to 1971, died on Wednesday at the Steward Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 years old.         She died of causes related to a stroke she suffered two years ago, said her daughter, Whitney Voss.         The novelist, who was professionally known as Hallie Burnett, made her reputation as a nurturer of young talent at Story magazine.         She joined the periodical in 1942 as assistant editor and new wife of its editor and founder, Whitney Ewing Burnett. Through the 1940's and 1950's, Story published known and unknown writers alike, paying the same standard fees. Salinger, Cheever, Etc.         During her tenure, Mrs. Burnett helped publish the early short stories of writers like J. D. Salinger, John Cheever and William Saroyan.         Then there was the young soldier named Joseph Heller who entered a writing contest held by the magazine. And there were stories from Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. A Harvard freshman named Norman Mailer won a Story college-writing prize for a piece entitled "The Greatest Thing in the World."         In addition to publishing Story, the Burnetts edited anthologies of stories and fiction, along with "Story Jubilee: Thirty-Three Years of Story" (1965). The Burnetts also operated Story Press, a book-publishing concern. Story magazine closed down in 1971, and Whitney Burnett died two years later.         In 1977, Mrs. Burnett married William Zeisel, who died in 1980. Wrotes Novels and Textbooks         Mrs. Burnett's novels were "A Woman in Possession" (1951), "This Heart, This Hunter" (1953), "The Brain Pickers" (1957) and "The Watch on the Wall" (1965). She also wrote a number of textbooks, including "On Writing a Short Story," which was published in 1983.         Mrs. Burnett, whose family name was Southgate, had little formal schooling in her native St. Louis. She spent a good deal of time at colleges as the daughter and niece of trustees. She was married in the 1930's to Robert Abbott, a college teacher, but the marriage ended in divorce.         Later, she returned to campuses to teach literature and creative writing at schools like Sarah Lawrence, Wagner College, Hunter College and the University of Missouri.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, John Burnett, of Bali, Indonesia, and six grandchildren.       
         Claire Zeisler, an artist and art collector who helped transform the two-dimensional craft of weaving into the three-dimensional medium called fiber art, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 88 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Joan Binkley of Lake Bluff, Ill.         Mrs. Zeisler, whose maiden name was Block, was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1903, and showed a strong interest in art from childhood. In 1921 she married Harold Florsheim, an heir to the Florsheim Shoe Company, and moved to Chicago.         For a while, her interest in art was manifested in a collection that became well known for its broad range and exquisite taste. In the 1930's, she acquired paintings by European modernists including Picasso, Miro and Klee, as well as objects from many tribal cultures, among them African sculptures, tantric art, ancient Peruvian textiles and more than 300 American Indian baskets. Later, she added works by prominent postwar American artists, from Franz Kline and Robert Rauschenberg to Jenny Holzer.         In 1943 Mrs. Zeisler divorced her husband, and in 1946 she married Ernest Zeisler, a physician and author. In the 1940's she also went back to school, studying with the sculptor Alexander Archipenko and with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy at the Illinois Institute of Technology, often known as the American Bauhaus. But it was the instruction she received from a Chicago weaver named Bea Swartchild that channeled her abiding interest in textiles toward the craft of weaving. A Move Toward Complexity         At first she created functional loomed weavings, but by 1962, the year of her first solo exhibition, she had abandoned the loom to create three-dimensional free-form fiber sculptures of increasing scale and complexity. These works actively exploited the inherent qualities of weaving and thread, especially in their emphasis on knotting and wrapping and on free-falling unwoven strands of fiber, a device that the artist considered her trademark.         After a 1963 exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City that also included fiber works by Sheila Hicks and Lenore Tawney, Mrs. Zeisler came to be seen as an innovator in her field. From then on, she exhibited widely, in Europe and Japan as well as the United States, and many museums acquired examples of her work. In 1979 the Art Institute of Chicago organized a retrospective of her art; a smaller exhibition was mounted by the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two sons, Peter Florsheim of Sedona, Ariz., and Thomas Florsheim of Milwaukee; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Zaring Stone, a novelist who also wrote under the pen name Ethel Vance, died on Sunday at the Mary Elizabeth Nursing Center in Mystic, Conn. She was 100 years old and had lived in Stonington, Conn.         Three of Mrs. Stone's novels were made into films: "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," in 1933, which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther; "Escape" (1940,) with Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor and Conrad Veidt, and "Winter Meeting" (1948,) with Bette Davis.         "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," about a New England woman who arrives in China to marry a missionary but becomes a captive of a Chinese warlord, was the first movie to be shown at Radio City Music Hall.         "Escape," an anti-Nazi thriller, was written in 1939 under the pseudonym Ethel Vance. In 1942 the author said the pen name had been used to protect her daughter, Eleanor Perenyi, who was living in occupied Europe, and because Mrs. Stone's husband, Ellis, was the United States naval attache in Paris, where they were living.         The book became a best seller, and Mrs. Stone used the Vance name for some of her later books, including "Reprisal" (1942) and "Winter Meeting," (1946).         Mrs. Stone was the great-great-granddaughter of Robert Owen, the British social reformer and socialist who founded the cooperative colony of New Harmony in Indiana. Her mother died when she was born, and she spent most of her childhood "visiting around," she said.         "In all the houses of the Owen descendants there were many books being very thoroughly read and almost everyone kept diaries," she said. "Diary keeping, writing in general, was just something one did. Then I married into the Navy and of course that was very, very different. But when my husband was stationed at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, the place seemed to get me started."         She wrote an account of a hurricane, and the Atlantic Monthly bought it, and later bought a short story as well. Then "Bobbs-Merrill wrote to ask me if I had a novel in mind, by any chance," Mrs. Stone said, "and of course that was a most amazing question to me, because I'd had a novel in mind practically forever."         Mrs. Stone's first novel was "The Heaven and Earth of Dona Elena," published in 1929. Her other works included "The Cold Journey" (1934,) "The Secret Thread" (1949) and "Althea" (1962).         Surviving besides her daughter, a writer, of Stonington, are a grandson and a great-graddaughter.       
         Dorothy Berliner Commins, a concert pianist and author, died on Monday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 102 years old.         Mrs. Commins was born in New York City and made her recital debut at Town Hall at the age of 12. She studied in New York and in Europe and had an active career for five decades. Her last concert was at Town Hall in the mid-1950's.         In 1927 she married Saxe Commins, who became editor in chief at Random House. He died in 1958. Mrs. Commins's books included a biography of her husband, "What Is an Editor?" (1978); "All About the Symphony Orchestra and What It Plays" (1961); "Lullabies of the World" (1967), and a compilation of letters exchanged by her husband and the playwright Eugene O'Neill.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Frances Commins Bennett of New Haven, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Marcia Simon Weisman, a collector admired for her discerning taste in postwar American art and as a benefactor who helped found the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 73 years old.         She died of a stroke, a spokesman for the hospital said.         Known for her instrumental role in galvanizing support for, and contributing art to, the Museum of Contemporary Art in the late 1970's and early 80's, Mrs. Weisman also gave prize works from her collection to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 1976 she initiated a program that resulted in the contribution by hundreds of donors of more than 8,000 works of art to Cedars-Sinai. She helped establish similar programs at medical institutions across the country. De Kooning, Warhol and Ruscha         Born in Portland, Ore., she was a daughter of Meyer Simon, who with Mrs. Weisman's brother, Norton Simon, went on to found Val Vita Food Products, a forerunner of Hunt Wesson Foods. She attended Mills College in Oakland, Calif., where she began collecting art, buying posters and prints. In 1938 she married Frederick R. Weisman, who worked with Norton Simon before he became the head of a large Toyota distributorship. Beginning in 1952 the Weismans amassed one of the finest private collections of modern art in the country at their home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         When they divorced in 1979, the couple divided their holdings, which had come to include sigificant paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings by Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Andy Warhol and others. To the National Gallery, Mrs. Weisman promised paintings by Ed Ruscha and Clyfford Still. To the Los Angeles County Museum of Art she gave works by Newman and Hans Hofmann, among others. Last year she gave Jasper Johns's "Map," perhaps the most important work in her collection, to the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.         Besides her brother, she is survived by a sister, Evelyn Simon Prell; two sons, Richard and Daniel; a daughter, Nancy, and two granddaughters.       
         Veronica Perry, a Harlem teacher and the mother of Edmund Perry, the honor student fatally shot by a police officer on Morningside Drive on June 12, 1985, died on Oct. 4 at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 44 years old.         She died as a result of a heart condition, the funeral home said.         Mrs. Perry, a fifth-generation Harlem resident and a graduate of Bronx Community College and Fordham University, was a teacher for the Lenox Hill Association. She was a past president of Community School Board 3 and of the Parent-Teacher Association of Wadleigh Junior High School and was a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club.         She is survived by her husband, Jonah Perry Sr.; her mother, Eva Rutledge; a son, Jonah Jr.; a daughter, Nicol, and several brothers and sisters.       
         Alice R. Bachrach, a volunteer leader of numerous national social service agencies who was involved in a landmark discrimination suit, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bachrach died of cancer, her family said.         Among her early activities, she organized and was chairwoman of the Women's Division of the National Jewish Welfare Board and was a vice president of the board for 19 years. She was a board member of the United Service Organizations during World War II and the Korean war.         She also had been an honorary governor of Hebrew Union College, vice president of the New York City Y.W.H.A., vice president of the national Girl Scouts and chairwoman of its American Girl magazine, executive committee member of the New York Blood Center and a trustee of the Parsons School of Design.         Mrs. Bachrach, whose maiden name was Rothschild, was born and grew up in Manhattan and studied at Parsons. She married Alfred R. Bachrach, a prominent accounting executive and president of Temple Emanu-El, the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. Mr. Bachrach has since died.         In a landmark case 30 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach filed a religious-discrimination complaint against a Park Avenue cooperative for rejecting their application to buy an apartment. The city Human Rights Commission upheld their complaint and moved for injunctive relief, the first time the agency exercised that remedy against a cooperative.         Mrs. Bachrach is survived by her twin sons, John, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Robert, of Manhattan and Southbury, Conn., and a daughter, Ellin Gordon, of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Melissa Gold, who was active in various civic causes, including help for earthquake victims in San Francisco and was a companion of Bill Graham, the rock music impressario, died Friday in the helicopter crash near San Francisco that killed Mr. Graham and his pilot. She was 47 years old and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Gold was also a member of a prominent East Coast family. Her father, Joseph Richardson Dilworth, is a former chairman and chief executive officer of the Rockefeller Group in New York City.         Mrs. Gold was born in Washington and grew up in Princeton, N.J. She was a graduate of Radcliffe College and moved to San Francisco, where she married Herbert Gold, a writer. After a divorce, she married Robert L. Anderson, a lawyer, from who she was also divorced.         She and Mr. Graham were first acquainted about 12 years ago, her father said, and their friendship was renewed when they worked on the plans for the public welcoming of Nelson Mandela to San Francisco last year. They had recently been working on a project to provide money to improve public schools.         Besides her father, survivors include her mother, Elizabeth, of Princeton; a daughter, Nina Gold of New York City; twin sons, Ethan Gold, a student at Harvard University, and Ari Gold, a student at Columbia University; a sister, Alexandria (Lucy) Nolan of Silver City, N.M., and two brothers, Charles D. Dilworth of San Francisco and Joseph R. Dilworth Jr. of Bronxville, N.Y.       
         Sylvia Fine Kaye, a producer, lyricist and composer, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Dena Kaye of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaye, the widow of the actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man" (1945), "The Kid from Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman and Danny Kaye. There she began writing specialty material, including a Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Mr. Kaye. In 1940, the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue."         That year, she married Mr. Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for her husband and accompanied him on piano. Wit and Patter         Mrs. Kaye was known for her complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines. Most frequently cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization. "I wrote many songs for Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect love song."         For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely for her husband. She once estimated that she wrote more than 100 songs for him during their 40-year collaboration. She was also involved in the production of almost all his films. She was twice nominated fpr Academy Awards for her work on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953). Musical Comedy on Television         In the 1970's, she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971 and at Yale in 1975. In 1979, she produced and narrated the course as a 90-minute PBS program, "Musical Comedy Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975 she was executive producer for a television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and edited "Assignment Children," a Unicef film that starred her husband.         In the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book about her life with Mr. Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She was also writing a catalogue of show-business material that she and her husband had donated to the Library of Congress.         Brooklyn College awarded her an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.         Mr. Kaye died in 1987 at age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.         Correction:  October 30, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the songwriter Sylvia Fine Kaye omitted a survivor. He is Robert Fine Forrest, of Manhattan, her brother.       
         Ernestine McClendon, an actress, comedian and theatrical consultant, died on Sept. 23 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 77 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of cancer, said Joahn Webb, a friend.         In the late 1950's, after 18 years as an actress, Ms. McClendon founded Ernestine McClendon Enterprises, a theatrical agency, in New York City. Later she also operated the agency in Los Angeles.         In recent years, she returned to performing, appearing in Los Angeles this year as a stand-up comedian. She made her first comedy appearance at the Apollo Theater in Harlem with her husband, George Wiltshire, who died in 1976, and his partner, Pigmeat Markham. She also appeared with them on Broadway and as a guest on Ed Sullivan's television show.         She acted in films including "A Face in the Crowd," "The Last Angry Man," "The Apartment" and "The Young Doctors."         She is survived by two sisters, Lessie M. Holloway of the Bronx and Wilma Taborn of Virginia Beach, Va.; a brother, Samuel K. Epps of Brooklyn; a daughter, Phyllis Davis of Baton Rouge, La., and four grandchildren.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Dorothea Matthews Dooling, founder and editorial director of Parabola, The Magazine of Myth and Tradition, died on Friday at her ranch in Jackson, Mont. She was 80 years old.         Mrs. Dooling had been diagnosed with acute leukemia last month, her family said.         Parabola, a quarterly magazine which Mrs. Dooling founded in 1976 in Manhattan, quickly earned a reputation as the major journal exploring myth and ancient spiritual traditions. It has a circulation of more than 100,000.         A lifelong interest in religion, mythology and folklore led Mrs. Dooling to found Parabola, each issue of which explores the quest for meaning in life through investigating a universal theme like wholeness, pilgrimage or death.         The daughter of an Episcopal bishop and a Procter & Gamble heiress, Mrs. Dooling was born in Glendale, Ohio.         In 1931, she married John Orville Dooling, a rancher and hotel owner in Jackson. Mrs. Dooling lived in Jackson until 1952, when she moved to Manhattan. She was divorced in 1953.         Mrs. Dooling's brother, T. S. Matthews, who died in January, was the editor of Time magazine from 1949 to 1953, a post he took over from Henry R. Luce, the magazine's creator.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Jackson, and Thomas, of Dillon, Mont.; four daughters, Mary Ann Troedson of Jackson, Janet Bertino of Bozeman, Mont., Catherine, of Stevensville, Mont., and Ellen Draper of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a sister, Margaret Flinsch of White Plains; 23 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Marion Letcher Bohmrich, a research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services and with the United States Mission to the United Nations, died on Thursday at Fair Haven Home in Bostic, N.C., where she was a resident. She was 89 years old.         She died of pneumonia and suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, a spokesperson for the home said. She had requested that her remains be made available for research at the Alzheimer's Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C.         Mrs. Bohmrich, a daughter of a Foreign Service officer, traveled and studied in Western Europe, focusing on German culture and tradition. In 1941, she was recruited by the O.S.S., forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, as a social science analyst.         After World War II, she was transferred to the Department of State and sent to the Mission to the United Nations, where she worked with Eleanor Roosevelt when she was chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights from 1946 to 1951.         A native of Turin, Ga., she attended a number of schools in Europe, Mexico and the United States, including Columbia University.         Her first marriage to John Moore McKeehan Woodburn, a writer and editor, ended in divorce. She later married Louis Bohmrich, a Foreign Service officer and lecturer on foreign affairs, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a stepson, Roger Bohmrich of White Plains, and a sister, Adele Letcher Goddard of Sun City, Ariz.       
         Simone Yellen Feldman, an interior designer, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of leukemia, said Victoria Hagan, her partner in Feldman-Hagan Interiors, a New York design firm.         Mrs. Feldman was born in New York and obtained a B.F.A. from Syracuse University. She established her own design firm in the late 1950's and became a member of the American Society of Interior Designers in 1975. Ms. Hagan met Mrs. Feldman through a mentor-apprenticeship program sponsored by the A.S.I.D. when she was a student at the Parsons School of Design in 1982. Mrs. Feldman founded Feldman-Hagan Interiors with Ms. Hagan in 1985 to specialize in residential interiors and corporate office work.  Uncluttered, Not Minimal         In the last few years, Feldman-Hagan Interiors has risen to prominence and garnered a following among stylish clients who favored a look that is uncluttered but not minimal. Spare, often neutral-colored rooms, were furnished with an eclectic mix of antiques and modern pieces, as well as graphic modern photographs.         Feldman-Hagan Interiors participated in the 1988 showhouse at Keewaydin, a home in Southampton, L.I., that benefited the Rogers Memorial Library there, and in the prestigious 1990 Kips Bay Boys' and Girls' Club Decorator Showhouse. The decorators devised a "salon of social consciousness," an airy living room that was considered the most influential room in the showhouse.  Recycling a Theme         Combining such objects as an antique toy airplane with a Louis XVI settee and including some handwritten words from Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince," the room wove the concepts of recycling and responsibility to nature into an elegant framework.         Mrs. Feldman's corporate clients have included U.S. Steel, the Harmonie Club and, most recently, Mitsui Fudosan, a Japanese real-estate company.         Mrs. Feldman is survived by her husband, Edgar; a brother, Sherman Yellen; a daughter, Mindy Schanback, and a grandson, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Gene Tierney, the elegant actress whose beauty bewitched a tough detective in the 1944 film "Laura" and whose portrayal two years later of a diabolically selfish woman in "Leave Her to Heaven" won her an Academy Award nomination, died Wednesday night at her home in Houston. She was 70 years old.         Miss Tierney died of emphysema, a spokesman for the family said.         Miss Tierney had undergone years of treatment for stress and depression. She retired from films in 1965 after making "The Pleasure Seekers," but made at least two television appearances after that. She told reporters that she preferred her life in Houston as the wife of W. Howard Lee, an oil man whom she married in 1960. He died in 1981. Trying to Cope         A year before her marriage to Mr. Lee, when reporters found her working in a dress shop in Topeka, Kan. (a job she took as part of her psychotherapy at the Menninger Clinic there), she told them she attributed her illness to "my lack of understanding of what I could cope with and what I could not. . . . I tried to work harder and harder, thinking that work would cure everything. All it did was make things worse."         With her blue-green eyes, brown hair, prominent cheekbones and what many young men of the 1940's regarded as the most appealing overbite of the day (Miss Tierney said her movie contract stipulated that her slightly protruding front teeth were never to be fixed) she won plaudits for her patrician look but some criticism for her acting.         Even in "Laura," which more than any other movie established her as a major star, Miss Tierney was faulted by some critics. In that film, a detective (Dana Andrews) falls in love with the portrait of a woman he believes has been murdered. For the first 30 minutes of the film, he and the other characters merely talk about her; then they discover she has not been murdered, and the character appears on screen.         For Thomas P. Pryor, who reviewed the film in The New York Times, Miss Tierney's entrance was a bit of a letdown. She did not "measure up to the word portrait of her character," he wrote.         Nevertheless, Miss Tierney received much praise over the years for the freshness and disarming directness she brought to her portrayal of Laura. The film is still regarded as a classic of its genre.         Among the critics who liked her work was Bosley Crowther, who in 1939 had first seen her perform in the Broadway comedy "Ring Two," by Gladys Hurlburt. She was not yet 20 years old and not long out of finishing school, and she had only a supporting role, but Mr. Crowther wrote in The New York Times that he thought she had talent.         Whatever talent she had she decided not to use on Broadway. She went to Hollywood in 1941, signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox and built her career there. Among her other motion picture credits are "The Return of Frank James" (1940), "Belle Starr" (1941), "The Shanghai Gesture" (1942), "Heaven Can Wait" (1943), "A Bell for Adano" (1945), "Dragonwyck" (1946), "The Razor's Edge" (1946), "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" (1947) and "The Left Hand of God" (1955).         Gene Tierney was born on Nov. 20, 1920, in Brooklyn, to Howard S. Tierney, a successful Manhattan insurance broker, and the former Belle Taylor. Miss Tierney was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; St. Margaret's School in Waterbury, Conn., and at a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. Even with all the propriety that surrounded her upbringing, her grade-school teachers noted that she liked to mimic them, and at St. Margaret's she was regarded as the "class romantic."  Background Showed Through         For some critics who reviewed her films, Miss Tierney could do nothing to obscure her privileged childhood. As early as 1941, when she made "Belle Starr," The Times said: "As for Miss Tierney, her youth and fancy finishing school background betray her. As Belle, she never shot a man, much less loved one."         But by 1946, when she made "Leave Her to Heaven," the actress in Miss Tierney that had been noticed years before by other critics emerged. David Thomson, in "A Biographical Dictionary of Film," said that in "Leave Her to Heaven," Miss Tierney's portrayal of the selfish and deadly character was "frighteningly credible."         In 1941, Miss Tierney eloped with Oleg Cassini, the well-known couturier and her own wardrobe designer. They had a daughter, Daria, in 1943, who was born retarded, a condition attributed to the German measles Miss Tierney contracted during her pregnancy. They had another daughter, Christina, in 1948.         Miss Tierney's marriage to Mr. Cassini ended in divorce. She is survived by their daughters, Daria, who is institutionalized, and Christina Belmont of Paris; four grandchildren, and a sister, Patricia Byrne of Boynton Beach, Fla.       
         Mary Vandergrift, a founder and longtime executive of Parke-Bernet Galleries auction house and for many years a major figure in international auctions, died in her sleep on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         Her daughter, Joan Sweeney of Manhattan, said the cause of death was heart failure.         Ms. Vandergrift was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 4, 1901, and attended college there. Pursuing an interest in art and antiques, she worked for American Art Galleries, later known as American Art Anderson Galleries, a well-known auction house in New York. In 1937, she left American Art with a group of employees that included Hiram H. Parke, Otto Bernet, Leslie A. Hyam and Lewis Marion. Together they formed Parke-Bernet Galleries, which came to dominate New York City's art and antiques auction scene.         Throughout her assocation with the house, Miss Vandergrift oversaw press relations and the design and production of catalogues. When Parke-Bernet was acquired by Sotheby & Company, an English auction house, in 1963, she was named executive vice president of the new firm, Sotheby Parke Bernet. When she retired in 1971, she was succeeded by John Marion, who is now chairman of the firm, which changed its name to Sotheby's Inc. in 1985.         Miss Vandergrift was on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development. Her first husband, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Sr., a career officer in the Army, died in the early 1950's; in 1968 she married E. Swift Newton, an Irish businessman, who died in 1974.         She is survived by her daughter; a sister, Katherine, of Manhattan; her step-son, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Jr., of Orlando, Fla., and three granddaughters.       
         Eleanor Pollock Hughes, former top editor of three national magazines and a public relations executive for several Federal agencies, died Friday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 91 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.         Mrs. Hughes died of heart disease, friends said.         Known professionally as Eleanor Pollock, she was a magazine editor in New York City for nearly three decades, starting in the 1930's. She was the editor in chief of Cue and Family Life, the managing editor of Charm and an assistant to Fleur Cowles in the women's division of Look and Quick magazines at Cowles Publications.         Switching to daily newspapers, she became the editor of the women's section at the Philadelphia Bulletin from the late 1950's to 1965. In that period she was also chairwoman of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award organization. Held Various Federal Posts         Serving in the Government from 1965 to 1973, she variously held the posts of the White House liaison for Project Head Start, public affairs director for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Commission on Product Safety and the National Commission on Materials Policy and press secretary to Betty Furness, when she was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs.         After leaving government employment, Mrs. Hughes did freelance writing and public relations consulting.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Alice Leal Pollock, an actress and playwright, and was educated at the Gardner and Finch Schools.         She was married and divorced from Byron Darnton, a reporter for The New York Times who was the first American correspondent killed while covering World War II. Her second husband, Albion Hughes, also a journalist, is deceased.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Ethel Halsey Blum, a painter, water colorist and former journalist, died on Wednesday at her home in Lakeville, Conn. She was 90 years old.         She died of pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Blum studied at the Art Students League and the Brooklyn Academy and had her work shown in New York and New England. Among her subjects were the land, sea and animals of Long Island, Maine, Connecticut and the Bahamas, places where she and her husband lived and vacationed.         She was a graduate of Wellesley College and had worked as a reporter in New Orleans, in France for The Paris Herald and in New York for The Associated Press.         Mrs. Blum was a past governor and president of the Cosmopolitan Club of New York, a founder of the Brooklyn Committee for Planned Parenthood and a former president of the Brooklyn Juvenile Guidance Center.         In Bal Harbor, Me., she was a trustee of the Mount Desert Island Hospital, a founder and former vice president of the Mount Desert Island Highway Safety Council and a trustee of the Mount Desert Biological Laboratory.         Mrs. Blum is survived by her husband, Robert E.; a son, John R. H., and a daughter, Alice B. Yoakum, both of Lakeville; a brother, Donald Halsey of New Orleans; 10 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Madeleine Martin, an artist and founder of the Peter and Madeleine Martin Foundation for the Creative Arts, died on Saturday in San Francisco. She was 69 years old and had homes in San Francisco and Fair Harbor, L.I.         She died of liver disease, her brother, Nelson Doubleday, said.         Mrs. Martin, a daughter of Ellen Doubleday and Atwood Violett, was born in New York City. She and her husband, Peter, who died in 1988, operated the New Yorker Bookstore, an Upper West Side institution that closed in 1982.         Mrs. Martin became an artist after serving in the Waves in World War II and after attending the California School of Fine Arts, where she studied under Hassell Smith. In 1990 she founded the arts foundation, which recognizes and rewards artists.         In addition to Mr. Doubleday, who lives in Hobe Sound, Fla., and Locust Valley, L.I., she is survived by a daughter, Lavinia Dimond of Ranchos de Taos, N.M.; two sisters, Ellen Violett of Manhattan, and Neltje, of Banner, Wyo.; two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Sybil Hart Kooper, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in New York, died yesterday at her home in Brooklyn Heights. She was 66 years old.         She died of breast cancer, a former aide said.         It was because of the cancer that she retired on Oct. 31 from the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division is the state's intermediate appeals court and the Second Judicial Department is in Brooklyn.         Justice Kooper was appointed to the Family Court by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1973, elected to the State Supreme Court two years later and was named by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the Appellate Division in 1985.         A champion of women's rights, she observed in 1982, during a convention of the National Association of Women Judges, that "women judges are sometimes very lonely."         She added, in an interview: "Through this organization we've gained a sense of identification and belonging. We've enhanced our sense of personal worth, price, strength." Notable Murder Trials         During her judicial career, she presided at some notable murder trials. Among them was the racially motivated slaying of a black transit worker, William Turks, by a group of white youths in 1983. When Justice Kooper sentenced a defendant, Gino Bova, to a 5-15 year sentence, she said with stinging terseness that there had been "a lynch mob" on the Brooklyn street that night. "The only thing missing was a rope and a tree," she said.         Justice Kooper, who born in Brooklyn, attended Wellesley College and graduated from the New York Law School. As an attorney, she specialized in family law before being named to the Family Court. Her father, Walter R. Hart, was also a justice of the State Supreme Court and rose to become Presiding Justice of the Appellate Term, Second Department.         Not long before she went on the bench, Justice Kooper sued to gain admittance to the 130-member citywide Metropolitan Trial Lawyers Association, contending that she had been excluded because of her sex. The suit was eventually settled and she became the association's first female member.         One appellate opinion she wrote concerned the boycott of the Red Apple grocery operated by Koreans in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Her finding in that case was that police officers were obliged to implement an order by a lower court that said demonstrators must remain at least 50 feet away from the store's entrance.         She is survived by her husband, Justice William C. Thompson of the Appellate Division; three sons from her first marriage, to Robert Ross, which ended in divorce: John Hart Ross of Washington D.C., James Franklin Ross and William Stewart Ross, both of Brooklyn, and a daughter from her second marriage, to Stanley E. Kooper, Dr. Grace Kooper, of Cumberland, R.I.

Her finding in that case was that police officers were obliged to carry out an order by a lower court that said demonstrators must remain at least 50 feet away from the store's entrance.         She is survived by her husband, Justice William C. Thompson of the Appellate Division; three sons from her first marriage, to Robert Ross, which ended in divorce: John Hart Ross of Washington D.C., James Franklin Ross and William Stewart Ross, both of Brooklyn, and a daughter from her second marriage, to Stanley E. Kooper, Dr. Grace Kooper, of Cumberland, R.I.         Correction:  December 14, 1991, Saturday         An obituary headline yesterday about a retired justice of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court rendered her name and age incorrectly in some editions. She was Sybil Hart Kooper, and she was 66 years old.

In addition to her philanthropic pursuits, she collected art and antiques and was a master bridge player.         Her husband, James H. McGraw Jr., died in 1970.

         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, the secretary of the Democratic National Committee who called the roll and tallied the votes at 12 national conventions from 1944 to 1988, died on Saturday in a hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Bush died of lung cancer, her stepdaughter, Jan Bush Jennings, told The Associated Press.         At each Democratic national convention, from the one that nominated the Roosevelt-Truman ticket to the one that drafted Michael S. Dukakis and Lloyd Bensten, Mrs. Bush called the role of states in a slight, but crisp, Dixie-accented voice that made her a fixture of the convention floor and a legend in the party. 'Born a Democrat'         "I was born a Democrat," she said before the 1976 convention, "like most people were born into religion."         Dorothy McElroy was born on Dec. 8, 1916, in Baldwyn, Miss., the third daughter of a postmaster. When she was in the eighth grade, her family moved to Columbus, Miss., so that she and her sisters could attend Mississippi State College for Women, from which she graduated in 1938.         In 1940, she married Peter Vredenburgh 3d, a wealthy Alabama lumberman and prominent Democrat, and quickly became enmeshed in politics. She was elected national committee woman of the Alabama Young Democrats in 1941 and a vice-president of the Young Democratic Clubs of America in 1943.         She was just 27 years old when she was named secretary to the Democratic National Committee in 1944. She was the first woman -- and the youngest person -- ever to serve in the position, which is unpaid.         Mr. Vredenburgh died in 1956, and in 1962 she married John W. Bush, then a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.         In addition to her work at the conventions, she also arranged meetings of the national and executive committees and kept party records.         She retired in September 1989.         In addition to Mr. Bush and Mrs. Jennings, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Emily Bush Zuckett.       
         Sarah Nederlander, the matriarch of the Nederlander theatrical family, died on Dec. 19 at her home in Southfield, Mich. She was 97 years old.         She died of natural causes, said David Techner, funeral director of the Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield.         Mrs. Nederlander, who was born Sarah Applebaum, married David T. Nederlander in 1916. Together they built the Nederlander Organization, which operates a chain of theaters and other entertainment enterprises. Mr. Nederlander died in 1967.         She is survived by a daughter, Frances Kohn, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and five sons: James M. of New York, chairman of the Nederlander Organization; Robert, also of New York, the organization's president; Harry, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Fred, of Franklin, Mich., and Joseph, of Birmingham, Mich.

         Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.         Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
