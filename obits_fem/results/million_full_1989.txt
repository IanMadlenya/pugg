        Beatrice Blackmar Gould, co-editor with her husband, Bruce, of the Ladies' Home Journal from 1935 until their retirement in 1967, died of Alzheimer's disease yesterday at their home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 90 years old.         Beatrice Blackmar Gould, co-editor with her husband, Bruce, of the Ladies' Home Journal from 1935 until their retirement in 1967, died of Alzheimer's disease yesterday at their home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Gould, who was born in Emmetsburg, Iowa, and held degrees from the University of Iowa and the Columbia School of Journalism, began her writing career as a reporter on the Ottumwa (Iowa) Courier in the early 1920's.         She later edited news about women for the New York Sunday World and contributed to several magazines, including the Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, Liberty and Vanity Fair.         With her husband, whom she married in 1923, she wrote two plays, ''Man's Estate,'' which the Theatre Guild produced in 1929, and ''The Terrible Turk,'' which appeared in 1934. The Goulds also wrote the screenplay ''Reunion'' in 1936.         In the 32 years the Goulds edited the Ladies' Home Journal, its circulation tripled to 7.5 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Gould is survived by a daughter, Sesaly Kraft of Federalsburg, Md.; a sister, Florence Snoke of Ann Arbor, Mich.; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
        Pegeen Fitzgerald, who, with her husband, Edward, conducted a radio talk show for 42 years and pioneered the at-home radio format, died of breast cancer Monday at her Manhattan home. She stated her age as 78 and also had a home in Kent, Conn.         Pegeen Fitzgerald, who, with her husband, Edward, conducted a radio talk show for 42 years and pioneered the at-home radio format, died of breast cancer Monday at her Manhattan home. She stated her age as 78 and also had a home in Kent, Conn.         ''The Fitzgeralds,'' subtitled ''Book Talk, Back Talk and Small Talk,'' was a radio institution, achieving at times an audience of 2 million listeners. It was broadcast mainly on WOR radio from the couple's 16th-floor apartment overlooking Central Park, and occasionally from their weekend homes in Hay Island, Conn., off Long Island Sound, and later from Kent, Conn., in the foothills of the Berkshires.         Mr. Fitzgerald died in 1982, at the age of 89, after 52 years of marriage, and Mrs. Fitzgerald continued a talk show on WOR and later on WNYC, until last April when she took a medical leave.         With ease and good humor, Mrs. Fitzgerald, a calm, homespun liberal, and Mr. Fitzgerald, a scholarly, theatrical conservative, bounced ideas, events and viewpoints off each other. Their casual preparation usually involved only glancing through newspapers and their mail. Cats and Commentary         Their only script was commercials, which they themselves styled, and they delivered them unobtrusively and at random. Their commentary, punctuated by the purring of their many cats, concerned the doings of friends and acquaintances and oddities in the news, and included occasional comments designed to shock bluenoses. The couple occasionally bickered on the air, but with wit and affection, in an effort to project the reality of their long marriage.         ''There is no easy way to describe what they do,'' Francis X. Clines wrote in The New York Times in 1979. ''They wool-gather and play off each other. They steep themselves daily in remembrances, using the airwaves as their Proustian bed.'' The husband often asked civility of the wife, and she responded by ''listening very carefully to him, correcting details, switching topics intuitively, reading the commercials elegantly and accurately.'' ''We're a true soap opera,'' she remarked to the reporter.         The loyalty of many listeners who regarded the Fitzgeralds as friends or part of their family frustrated some broadcast executives who tried to take them off the air several times. This loyalty extended to listeners who sent them their cats when entering nursing homes and others who willed their pets to the couple, who often had 10 cats in their apartment and 100 at their weekend home. Headed Animal Protection Groups         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's last years, she continued to maintain the Last Post, a shelter in Falls Village, Conn., and also aided many orphans, convicts and former convicts.         She said she believed deeply in antivivisection and ethical vegetarianism, refusing to eat meat or fish or to wear a fur coat ''because I don't want any living thing killed for my own use or pleasure.'' She headed two animal groups as president of the Vivisection Investigation League and as executive director of the Millenium Guild.         Mrs. Fitzgerald, a vivacious, stylish woman, has been described by friends as a gracious hostess who invariably kept champagne in her refrigerator for guests. From Portland to New York         Pegeen Fitzgerald was born Margaret Worrall in Norcatur, Kan., the eldest of seven children of Fred Calvin Worrall and the former Jane Sweeney, who were of French and Irish ancestry. In Pegeen's early teens, the family moved to Portland, Ore., where she graduated from high school at 15.         She attended the College of St. Theresa in Winona, Minn., but had to leave and seek work after two years when her father fell ill. She started to work in a Portland department store, rising from bookkeeper to advertising copywriter to assistant advertising manager. She married Mr. Fitzgerald in 1930.         He worked as a newspaper reporter and as a movie publicist, and entered radio in 1933 as a master of ceremonies for a variety show. The couple went to New York in 1936 and he joined WOR, where he gained success with a program on books and current events. She, meanwhile, was the advertising manager of McCreery's department store but, after several years, also joined WOR, where she had a talk show and then, in 1940, joined her husband and began broadcasting from their home.         Surviving are four sisters, Irene McAllister, of San Jose, Calif.; Cristine Sharkey, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; Eve Jane Mueller, of Portland, Ore.; and Mimi Findlay, of Martinez, Calif., and a brother, P. J. Worrall, of Alamo, Calif.

Ruth Moore Garbe, a writer of books about science, died of cancer Monday at her brother's home in San Francisco. She was 80 years old lived in San Francisco.         Under the name of Ruth Moore, Mrs. Garbe was the author of books that included ''Man, Time and Fossils'' and ''The Coil of Life: The Story of the Great Discoveries in the Life of Sciences'' published in 1953 and 1961 by Alfred Knopf & Co. She also wrote a biography of Nils Bohr, published by Knopf in 1966.         She was a graduate of Washington University, St. Louis. From 1943 to 1970 she was a reporter for The Chicago Sun-Times.         In 1986, Mrs. Garbe and her brother, Norman Moore, gave $1 million to Washington University to endow a professorship in architecture. In 1987 she and her husband, Raymond W. Garbe, since deceased, donated $1 million to Harvard University to endow a professorship in urban design.         She is survived by her brother.       
        Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920 and, over the years, turned it into an international literary haven. It is still thriving at 41 West 47th Street in Manhattan, an anachronism in a time of failing independent bookstores.         Soon after the store opened, it attracted authors, dramatists, poets and artists. Among those who came to chat, to browse and to see if their books and plays were on the shelves were Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, H. L. Mencken and Eugene O'Neill. Her customers included George and Ira Gershwin, Ina Claire and Charlie Chaplin, and, more recently, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, John Guare and Garson Kanin.         She championed the experimental and challenged the censors. Her courage in purchasing shipments of the banned ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' directly from D. H. Lawrence in Italy in the late 1920's and in ordering smuggled copies of ''Tropic of Cancer'' from Henry Miller in Paris during the 1930's led to lawsuits and landmark decisions on censorship.         Although Miss Steloff sold the Gotham in 1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, she continued to live in an apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working consultant. She ignored her age and her semiretirement, descending every afternoon to sit at a desk in her own corner, occasionally jumping up to press books on browsers, and then to direct them to the cash register. Browsers Welcome         Essentially a person of no literary pretensions, Miss Steloff made her bookstore a place cherished as the habitat for the new and the avant-garde in literature, where small magazines and forgotten books of poetry, out-of-print books on belles-lettres and works on film and the theater could be found in an atmosphere congenial to browsers.         Under her guidance the Gotham became a meeting place for the literati and a bibliophile's paradise. The number of well-known writers, dancers, artists and theater people who were her customers, clients and friends made up an encyclopedia of 20th-century culture. At her 100th birthday celebration, on Dec. 31, 1987, greetings arrived from all over the world.         Miss Steloff was one of the founders of the James Joyce Society, which still meets at the Gotham, although she never met the author. ''Sylvia Beach took care of his book wants at Shakespeare & Company in Paris,'' she said. ''But sometimes Joyce ordered books from the Gotham directly by mail - including during the last year of his life.''         After working in several bookstores, she opened her own on West 45th Street in 1920. The store moved twice to larger quarters. ''It was a struggle at the beginning,'' she recalled. ''There were some days during the Depression when we didn't sell a single book.'' An Interest in the Mystical         ''I am not the great brilliant person to decide about how good a book is,'' she said once. ''I judge books by my customers who buy them and spark others to read them.'' She was greatly interested in Oriental teachings, mystical experiences and philosophers not connected with established Western churches. Books in these fields were represented in her corner of the store.         Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully operated book business. As the owner and the person who paid the salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much concentration into the store as she did.         Miss Steloff recalled some of the clerks who had worked for the Gotham over the years. ''There was Allen Ginsberg and LeRoi Jones and many poets in their youth,'' she said. ''Tennessee Williams lasted less than a day - he couldn't get here on time in the morning and, also, he wasn't very good at wrapping packages.'' Sold Flowers in Hotels         Ida Frances Steloff was born Dec. 31, 1887, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a town full of gaiety in the summer and a bleak, wintry place for the rest of the year, especially for the poor. The Steloffs, who lived year round in Saratoga Springs, were among the very poor. When Miss Stefloff was little, she sold flowers on the verandas of the big hotels. The early death of her mother increased her misery, especially when her stepmother expressed her frustrations with poverty in the harshness she showed the children.         At 12, Miss Steloff was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. But she soon found herself a menial in the household and was forced to drop out of the seventh grade - her last formal schooling. Once in desperation she ran away to New York City. It was not until she was 19 that she made a final move to New York. She landed a job at Loeser's, a Brooklyn department store, working in ''corsets.'' But during the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the books department.         It was like giving a copy of Euclid to Isaac Newton: She had found herself and a way of life.         For the next 12 years she worked in various bookstores: Schulte, Brentano and McDevitt-Wilson, where she developed what one friend called ''an instinctive taste for the best in modern literature,'' a taste that she was willing to gamble on when she had her own shop. She never referred to Gotham as a store; it was always a ''shop.''         Her stature concealed her stamina. She ran the place, but she also opened the correspondence, wrapped and mailed packages, climbed up and down ladders and argued with publishers. Bookstore people were continually helping her down from ladders in her 80's. ''She feels,'' Mr. Brown said, ''as if she still has to stock the store.'' A Doctorate From Skidmore         Miss Steloff was awarded a prize by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for distinguished service to the arts, was listed in Who's Who in the Theater and received an honorary doctorate from Skidmore College - an award that stood in sharp contrast to one of her remarks:         ''I used to feel bitter and cheated about not having a formal education. But why should I? How could I, no matter what my education, ever have had the wonderful chance to have Thornton Wilder and other people talk to me personally, and right here in my shop! As if they were in their classrooms! I couldn't ask for anything more.''         A battle to save the bookstore ended last February, when Mr. Brown bought the building that houses the store from the American Friends of the Hebrew University Foundation. With the $1 million proceeds, the foundation has established a scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the name of Miss Steloff's parents.         It was quiet yesterday at the cozy bookstore, with a sprinkling of students and literary buffs brousing through the volumes. In the hall on the second floor hung oversized photographs of Miss Steloff - with Dylan Thomas in 1952, Anais Nin in 1966, Jean Cocteau in 1948, Salvador Dali in 1963, Marianne Moore in 1967. Memorial Service Is Planned         Although funeral arrangements were not yet complete, Mr. Brown said yesterday that Miss Steloff would be buried Monday in the family plot in the Jewish Cemetery at Saratoga Springs.         The Gotham will be closed on that day in her memory. Mr. Brown said he would post a sign and pictures of Miss Steloff in the bookstore window. A memorial service is to be held in three or four weeks, he said.         On May 11, Miss Steloff was to have been presented Brandeis University's Notable Achievement Award.         Miss Steloff was married to David Moss in 1923. They were divorced in 1930 and had no children.         Surviving are a half sister, Belle Sidoroff, of Wilmington, Del., and a half brother, Al Steloff, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.       
        Dame Daphne du Maurier, the author of ''Rebecca'' and other highly popular Gothic and romantic novels that were turned into films, plays and documentaries, died yesterday in her sleep at home in the village of Par in Cornwall, on the rugged southwestern coast of England, a setting she had peopled with characters who were cherished by readers all over the world.         Dame Daphne du Maurier, the author of ''Rebecca'' and other highly popular Gothic and romantic novels that were turned into films, plays and documentaries, died yesterday in her sleep at home in the village of Par in Cornwall, on the rugged southwestern coast of England, a setting she had peopled with characters who were cherished by readers all over the world. She was 81 years old.         ''Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again . . . I came upon it suddenly; the approach masked by the unnatural growth of a vast shrub that spread in all directions . . . There was Manderley, our Manderley, secretive and silent as it had always been, the gray stone shining in the moonlight of my dream, the mullioned windows reflecting the green lawns and terrace. Time could not wreck the perfect symmetry of those walls, nor the site itself, a jewel in the hollow of a hand.'' With 'Rebecca,' a Classic         With those famous opening lines of ''Rebecca,'' written by Miss du Maurier when she was 31, she created one of the classic Gothic romances. It is a story about a young woman who marries a widower and becomes the new mistress of a mansion haunted by the image of his first wife. Trying to solve the mystery, she is drawn into a psychological labyrinth. As the model for Manderley, Miss du Maurier used Menabilly, a 70-room manor on the Cornwall coast. Later, fulfilling a childhood dream, she and her husband moved into the mansion that had served as the setting for her novel.         One British critic called the novel ''a Charlotte Bronte story minus Bronte,'' but found it had its own appeal. Another critic, Basil Davenport, called it a ''melodrama, unashamed, glorying its own quality, such as we have hardly had since that other dependent, Jane Eyre, found that her house too had a first wife.'' In The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote, ''You know the end before you know the beginning; you never know the beginning until, almost, the end. That is a writer's art. Call it a trick, if you like; a trick performed as well as Miss du Maurier performs this trick is art.'' 'I Lose Myself in the Plot'         Long after the novel's international success, Miss du Maurier said she could never understand why it had become an instant favorite that eventually sold over a million hardcover copies. ''It is true that I immersed myself in the characters, especially in the narrator, but then this has happened throughout my writing career. I lose myself in the plot as it unfolds.''         All her life she received letters from readers about the characters in ''Rebecca,'' often asking why she did not give her heroine a Christian name. She explained, ''The answer is simple - I could not think of one, and it became a challenge in technique, the easier because I was writing in the first person.''         Although she had lived in Cornwall quietly, with occasional visits from her son and two daughters, to her neighbors she was known for her interest in protecting the integrity of the land and seascape around her against exploitation. Up to two weeks ago, she took her dog for daily walks along the beach. Several Films From Other Books         Friends said she carried her authorial fame and honors lightly. As the wife of Lieut. Gen. Sir Frederick A. M. Browning, who died in 1965 after serving as treasurer to the Duke of Edinburgh, she was also known as Lady Browning. In 1969, Miss du Maurier was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire.         In addition to ''Rebecca'' (the 1940 film that starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine), other movies adapted from her novels included ''Jamaica Inn'' (1939), ''Frenchman's Creek'' (1944), ''The Years Between'' (1946), ''Hungry Hill'' (1947) and ''My Cousin Rachel'' (1953). ''The Birds,'' directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1963, was based on a short story by Miss du Maurier that appeared in a collection, ''Kiss Me Again, Stranger.''         She also wrote a biography of her father, ''Gerald,'' a famous actor and theater manager; ''The du Mauriers,'' a family history; ''The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte, a biography of Patrick Branwell Bronte; and several plays - ''Rebecca,'' based on her novel; ''The Years Between'' and ''September Tide.'' The End as Beginning         Once, talking about the technique of her writing genre, she said, ''What is a suspense novel? The term is a loose one, covering any story from a whodunit to a frivolity turning on which dark stranger gets the blonde. People in doubt, people mystified, people groping their way from one situation to another, from childhood to middle age, from joy to sorrow - these are the figures in a true suspense novel. They are traveling along a road of uncertainty toward an unseen goal. The suspense novel succeeds if the reader says to himself at the final page, 'Yes - it couldn't happen any other way.' In its end, to paraphrase Mary, Queen of Scots, is its beginning.''         Miss du Maurier spoke of her writing without pretension, according to her friends. Asked if one of her novels was about ''boy meets girl,'' the author replied, ''No, it's ghoul meets goon.''         She is survived by a son, Christian Frederick du Maurier-Browning, and two daughters, Lady Tessa Montgomery and Lady Flavia Leng.       
        Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         Lucille Ball, the irrepressible queen of television comedy for nearly a quarter-century, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles a week after undergoing heart surgery there. She was 77 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Ron Wise, said the actress had suffered a rupture of the aorta after having improved steadily from a seven-hour operation.         Miss Ball, noted for impeccable timing, deft pantomime and an endearing talent for making the outrageous believable, was a Hollywood legend: a contract player at RKO in the 1930's and 40's who later bought the studio with Desi Arnaz, her first husband.         She made her last public appearance four weeks ago at the Academy Awards ceremonies, when she and Bob Hope introduced a production number.         The elastic-faced, husky-voiced comedian was a national institution from 1951 to 1974 in three series and many specials on television that centered on her ''Lucy'' character. The first series, ''I Love Lucy,'' was for six years the most successful comedy series on television, never ranking lower than third. The series, on CBS, chronicled the life of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a Cuban band leader played by Mr. Arnaz, who was Miss Ball's husband on and off screen for nearly 20 years.         It was a major national event when, on Jan. 19, 1953, Lucy Ricardo gave birth to Little Ricky on the air the same night Lucille Ball gave birth to her second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha 4th. The audience for the episode was estimated at 44 million, a record at the time, and CBS said 1 million viewers responded with congratulatory telephone calls, telegrams, letters or gifts. Miss Ball's first child, Lucie Desiree Arnaz, was born July 17, 1951, three months before the show went on the air.         The Ricardos were the best-known, best-loved couple in America, and the first ''Lucy'' series is still in syndication in more than 80 countries, at times with six episodes a day in a single area.         Analyzing the reasons, Miss Ball explained why her inspired exaggeration of an average middle-class housewife was credible: ''I believe it all the way. I do what I do with all my strength and heart.''         ''Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS,'' William S. Paley, the chairman of the network, said yesterday in a tribute issued by his office. ''Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever.''         Miss Ball was also an astute business executive. From 1962 to 1967, she headed Desilu Productions, one of the biggest and most successful television production companies. Also, starting in 1968, she and her second husband, Gary Morton, a former nightclub comic, headed Lucille Ball Productions.         She bought Mr. Arnaz's share of Desilu Productions in 1962 with a $3 million bank loan, and she sold the company to Gulf and Western Industries in 1967 for $17 million. Her share totaled $10 million.         Discussing how she became an executive, Miss Ball said: ''My ability comes from fairness and a knowledge of people. I ran my studio like I run my home, with understanding of people. We touch in our house. I tell my children, 'There's so little time.' ''         Miss Ball was a tireless worker. ''I have to work or I'm nothing,'' she once said. ''I've never been out of work except for two hours once between contracts.'' On the set, she was said to know every term, every lighting fixture and every worker. A Veteran of Motion Pictures         Before entering television, Miss Ball appeared in more than 50 films, beginning in 1933 as an unbilled chorus girl in an Eddie Cantor musical farce, ''Roman Scandals.'' Her other films included ''Having Wonderful Time'' (1938), ''Room Service'' (1938), ''The Big Street'' (1942), ''Best Foot Forward'' (1943), the title role in ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1943), ''Without Love'' (1945), ''Sorrowful Jones'' (1949) and ''Fancy Pants'' (1950).         James Agee, the writer and film critic, observed that Miss Ball ''tackles a role like it was sirloin and she didn't care who was looking.'' Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote in 1938 that she ''is rapidly becoming one of our brightest comediennes.'' In 1960 she also starred in a Broadway musical, ''Wildcat.''         In 1964 there was a Lucy Day at the New York World's Fair, and in 1971 she became the first woman to receive the International Radio and Television Society's Gold Medal. Her many other awards included four Emmys, induction into the Television Hall of Fame and a citation for lifetime achievement from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Daughter of a Pianist         Lucille Desiree Ball was born on Aug. 6, 1911 in Celoron, outside Jamestown, N.Y. She was the daughter of the former Desiree Hunt, a pianist, and Henry Dunnell Ball, a telephone lineman, who died when she was 3.         As a girl she spent a great deal of time with her maternal grandparents, who instilled in her a deep family loyalty and a commitment to hard work. Her favorite times were attending vaudeville shows and silent films and acting out episodes and plays. Of a school production of ''Charley's Aunt,'' she said, ''I played the lead, directed it, cast it, sold tickets, printed the posters and hauled in furniture for props.''         She embarked on a show-business career at 15 by going to Manhattan and enrolling in John Murray Anderson's dramatic school. From the first, she was repeatedly told she had no talent and should return home. She tried and failed to get into four Broadway chorus lines. From Soda Jerk to Cigarette Girl         She worked variously as a waitress and as a soda jerk in a Broadway drugstore. She then became a hat model in Hattie Carnegie's salon and also modeled for commercial photographers. She won national attention as the Chesterfield Cigarette Girl in 1933. This got her to Hollywood as a Goldwyn chorus girl in ''Roman Scandals.''         Over two years, she played unbilled and bit roles in two dozen movies and made two-reel comedies with Leon Errol and the Three Stooges. She then spent seven years at RKO Radio Pictures, getting many leading roles in low-budget movies. She was typed and mostly wasted in films, but a few roles suggested her talents - a cynical young actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), a temperamental movie star in ''The Affairs of Annabel'' (1938), a rejected lover in the 1939 melodrama ''Five Came Back,'' a gold-digging stripper in ''Dance, Girl, Dance'' (1940), a handicapped egotist in ''The Big Street'' (1942) and a tough-talking secretary in ''The Dark Corner'' (1946).         ''I never cared about the movies,'' she said later, ''because they cast me wrong.'' A Regular on the Radio         In radio, Miss Ball did regular stints on Phil Baker's and Jack Haley's comedy-variety shows in the late 30's and 40's and, from 1947 to 1951, she played the precursor to Lucy: the hare-brained wife of a Midwestern banker (Lee Bowman and later Richard Denning) in the CBS radio comedy ''My Favorite Husband.'' The show's writers were Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr., who were to write many Lucy scripts in later decades.         On the stage, Miss Ball won favorable notices for a 22-week tour in the title role of Elmer Rice's fantasy ''Dream Girl.''         In 1950, she and Mr. Arnaz tried to sell the ''I Love Lucy'' television show to CBS. Network executives objected, contending the public would not accept the team of an American redhead and a Cuban bandleader with a heavy accent. To prove their case, the couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour with a 20-minute act that included a ''Cuban Pete-Sally Sweet'' medley. They produced a 30-minute film pilot with $5,000 of their own money. The broadcast officials were won over. Premiere in 1951         ''I Love Lucy'' had its premiere on Oct. 15, 1951, and within a few months millions of Americans tuned in every Monday evening to watch the antics of the Ricardos and their best friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz (William Frawley and Vivian Vance).         ''I Love Lucy'' was one of the first shows to be filmed rather than performed live, making it possible to have a high-quality print of each episode for rebroadcast, compared with the poor quality of live-show kinescopes. The change eventually led to a shift of television production from New York to Hollywood. The show was the first to be filmed before an audience, and crew members used three cameras at once to permit motion-picture-type editing. The series won more than 200 awards, including five Emmys.         Jack Gould of The Times offered this analysis: ''The extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce gives 'I Love Lucy' its engaging lilt and lift. Only after a firm foundation of credibility has been established is the element of absdurdity introduced. It is in the smooth transition from sense to nonsense that 'I Love Lucy' imparts both a warmth and a reality to the slapstick romp that comes as the climax.'' Miss Ball's superb timing, Mr. Gould wrote, makes her ''the distaff equivalent of Jack Benny,'' her professional idol. A Fortune in Rerun Rights         Mr. Arnaz made a fortune for the couple by obtaining rerun rights for the series. He later sold the rights to CBS, allowing the couple's production company, Desilu, to buy a studio, the former RKO lot where Miss Ball's film career had languished and where they had met in 1940 while appearing together in ''Too Many Girls.''         Despite the continuing popularity of ''I Love Lucy,'' the couple sought a less demanding schedule and ended the series in 1957 after making 179 episodes. The format persisted, however, for three more years through a series of hourlong, high-budget, around-the-world specials called ''The Luci-Desi Comedy Hour.'' Their collaboration ended with their divorce in 1960. Mr. Arnaz died in 1986.         Two years after their divorce, Miss Ball revived ''Lucy,'' playing a widow in ''The Lucy Show'' for 156 episodes until 1968, then did ''Here's Lucy'' for 144 episodes from 1968 to 1974. In these two series she was joined by her two children, her longtime friend Vivian Vance and Gale Gordon, who succeeded Mr. Arnaz as her masculine foil. In shaping situation comedies, Miss Ball consistently sought superior writers, followed their advice, gave them unstinting credit and paid close attention to production details.         In later movies, she co-starred with Bob Hope in two comedies, ''The Facts of Life'' (1961) and ''Critic's Choice'' (1963), and appeared with Henry Fonda in ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' a 1968 farce about a couple with nearly a score of children. In 1974 she starred in a film version of the stage hit ''Mame.'' Last Series Failed         Miss Ball also appeared occasionaly in television specials and played a spunky bag lady in a 1985 television movie, ''Stone Pillow.'' John J. O'Connor of The Times said she was ''as wily and irresistible as ever'' and ''in total control.'' In 1986, she returned to weekly television as a grandmother in another sitcom series called ''Life With Lucy,'' but it failed to gain an audience.         Addressing a group of would-be actors, she said the best way to get along with tough directors was ''don't die when they knock you down.'' She said she was very shy at the start of her career, but overcame it when ''it finally occurred to me that nobody cared a damn.''         Associates called Miss Ball self-reliant, sympathetic and sometimes tempestuous. ''Life is no fun,'' she once said, ''without someone to share it with.''         For many years she and Mr. Morton had homes in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs and in Snowmass, Colo.         Miss Ball is survived by her husband, her daughter, her son and three grandchildren.         Funeral plans were incomplete last night.       
        Janice Poliak, a philanthropist whose donation helped establish the Center for the Study of First Amendment Issues at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, died of lung cancer yesterday at Danbury (Conn.) Hospital. She was 79 years old and had homes in Redding, Conn., Manhattan and Montego Bay,         Janice Poliak, a philanthropist whose donation helped establish the Center for the Study of First Amendment Issues at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, died of lung cancer yesterday at Danbury (Conn.) Hospital. She was 79 years old and had homes in Redding, Conn., Manhattan and Montego Bay, Jamaica.         Mrs. Poliak and her husband, Saul, president of Kotch & Poliak Inc., a New York concern that produces industrial expositions and conferences, donated $3 million to establish the Columbia center in 1983. The gift was the largest in the school's history.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Poliak is survived by a brother, Edmund Perls of Miami.       
        Hibari Misora, known as ''the queen'' of Japanese singers, died of heart failure today after a long illness. She was 52 years old.         Hibari Misora, known as ''the queen'' of Japanese singers, died of heart failure today after a long illness. She was 52 years old.         Born Kazue Kato, Miss Misora's stage name means ''skylark beautiful sky.'' From the time in 1948 when she made her debut, at age 11, her songs cheered people left hopeless by Japan's defeat in World War II.         Masao Yamaguchi, a professor at Tokyo Foreign Language University, credited Miss Misora with a role in helping the nation's recovery and economic growth in the postwar era.         Miss Misora released 1,200 songs and sold 68 million records, including 45 million singles. She received numerous awards and was an actress in many Japanese musical movies and plays.       
        Mitzi E. Newhouse, who donated $1 million in 1973 to make possible the continued operation of the two theaters in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 years old.         Mitzi E. Newhouse, who donated $1 million in 1973 to make possible the continued operation of the two theaters in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 years old.         The theaters had come upon hard financial times before Mrs. Newhouse made her gift, and in gratitude for her largesse, Joseph Papp, whose New York Shakespeare Festival was then the theater constituent of Lincoln Center, announced that the Forum Theater would be renamed the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater.         Mrs. Newhouse was the widow of Samuel I. Newhouse, the publisher who built an empire that included more than 30 newspapers, the Conde Nast group of magazines, Random House books and several radio stations and cable-television systems. Abiding Interest in Fashion         Mrs. Newhouse, diminutive and animated, was known as one of the most fashionably dressed women in the world.         In 1959, Mr. Newhouse bought the Conde Nast group of magazines, which included Vogue, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Bride's, Self and House & Garden. The magazine group now also publishes The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Conde Nast Traveler.         Mr. Newhouse, who died in 1979, described the acquisition of the magazine group that devoted so much coverage to the fashion world as ''an anniversary present for my wonderful wife, Mitzi.'' The remark was interpreted as being only half in jest, but Mrs. Newhouse said she was ''particularly delighted to have Vogue in the family.'' Studied at Parsons School         Mrs. Newhouse, who stood 5 feet tall - only 3 inches shorter than her husband - was the former Mitzi Epstein. She was a student at the Parsons School of Design when they met, and they were married on May 8, 1924.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Newhouse cut a stylish figure in New York and Palm Beach with her designer clothes. Her favorite couturiers were Givenchy and Dior. Although her husband was not noted for gregariousness, Mrs. Newhouse managed to involve him in her world of society and high fashion, and they were inveterate first-nighters at New York theaters.         Mrs. Newhouse presided over several homes, including the couple's 12-room duplex apartment on Park Avenue and their weekend retreat, Greenlands, a rambling early-American farmhouse in Harbourton, N.J.         She is survived by her two sons, S. I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, both of New York City; a brother, Walter Evans of St. Louis; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
        Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         Fran Allison, the warm-voiced human component of the popular television show ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie,'' died of bone marrow failure at the Sherman Oaks (Calif.) Community Hospital yesterday. She was 81 years old and lived in Van Nuys, Calif.         To a generation of children in the late 1940's and the 50's, Miss Allison was the girlfriend, mother and gentle conscience of the Kuklapolitan Players, the puppet troupe created by Burr Tillstrom. Thanks to Tillstrom and Miss Allison, who treated the puppets like people, their exploits and personalities made them family favorites on prime-time television for 10 years.         ''I adored Kukla and Ollie - they were never anything but real to me,'' Miss Allison said in an interview.  Joining the Kuklapolitans She was born in La Porte City, Iowa, and after graduating from Coe College became a teacher. Later, she auditioned as a singer on a local radio station. By 1937, she was a popular radio personality in Chicago.         In 1947, she joined the Kuklapolitan Players, and they made their television debut the following year. ''I needed a girl who could talk to a dragon,'' Tillstrom explained.         By 1950, the show had six million viewers. As Fran, Miss Allison seemed particularly fond of Ollie, an outrageous, single-toothed dragon who adored buttered popcorn and putting his hair in curlers. Kukla loved to lean on Ollie's head, messing his hair. Fran was the soothing character.         In those years, television was performed live and Miss Allison once admitted she never knew in advance exactly what the puppets would say. ''On the air, you say exactly the same thing you would say if it happened for the first time, off the air,'' she said in an interview. A Baritone Dragon         In the early 1950's, Miss Allison made her Town Hall debut, assisting Ollie, whose full name was Oliver J. Dragon, in his first Manhattan performance as a baritone.         ''It may be ironic,'' The New York Times observed in 1952, ''but Kukla and Ollie still seem so real that it's always a little disturbing when Burr Tillstrom steps into view.''         When the program went off the air, it left a group of sad adults and children. ''One of the most imaginative shows ever developed in the electronic medium,'' wrote the Times critic. The program reappeared briefly in the 1970's. Burr Tillstrom died in 1985 at the age of 68.         In the 1960's, Miss Allison was host of a show of films for children and appeared in musicals on television. In Los Angeles, she was host of a program for the elderly, ''Prime Time,'' on KHJ-TV.         Miss Allison is survived by her brother, Lynn, of Chicago.

Jane Cheney Spock, a civil liberties advocate and writing assistant to Dr. Benjamin M. Spock, her former husband, died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Saturday after suffering a stroke. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She was born in Manchester, Conn., and attended Bryn Mawr College.         She married Dr. Spock in 1927 and assisted him in the research and writing of ''Dr. Spock's Baby & Child Care'' (E. P. Dutton), which was published in 1946 by Duell, Sloan & Pearce as ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care.'' The book has sold more than 34 million copies in 31 languages.         Mrs. Spock was active in Americans for Democratic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. After her divorce in 1976, she organized and ran support groups for older divorced women.         Surviving are two sons, Michael, of Chicago, and John, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
        Leonora Highet Messmore, a connoisseur of fine art and a needlepoint expert, died Thursday at her home in Southampton, L.I., after battling cancer for 23 years. She was 81 years old.         Leonora Highet Messmore, a connoisseur of fine art and a needlepoint expert, died Thursday at her home in Southampton, L.I., after battling cancer for 23 years. She was 81 years old.         For many years, Mrs. Messmore helped her husband, Carman, an art dealer, establish many notable collections of old masters. In 1947 Mr. Messmore persuaded Joan Whitney Payson to buy Van Gogh's ''Irises'' for $84,000. Forty years later Mrs. Payson's son, John Whitney Payson, sold the painting at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million - the highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction. Both Mr. Messmore and Mrs. Payson died in 1975.         Mrs. Messmore designed and sold beaded cashmere sweaters for 20 years through her company, Messmore Originals. One of her projects, an 81-square-foot needlepoint rug, took her nine years to complete.         Friends said she showed extraordinary courage in battling cancer for so many years. She was born in Sterling, Scotland, and grew up in England and Malaya, as Malaysia, a former British colony, was then known. In World War II she helped in many aid programs for Britain. She was a first-rate bridge player and winner of many croquet tournaments.         Surviving are two stepdaughters, Ann Close of Rochester and Frances Rice of Fox Chapel, Pa.; a stepson, Carroll Robertson of Charleston, S.C.; four grandchildren, three nephews and a niece.       
        Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         Diana Vreeland, the legendary fashion editor and creator of spectacular fashion exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, died of a heart attack yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was believed to be in her late 80's and had been in failing health for several years.         In the more than 40 years that she was associated with the fashion world, she was called an oracle, the high priestess of fashion, a myth maker. She was the fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1937 to 1962, when she moved to Vogue. There, she was editor in chief until 1971.         Instead of resting on her laurels, she went on, as consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to a new career of staging annual fashion exhibitions that drew almost one million visitors a year and made the museum a center of fashion excitement for New York City and the world.         ''She was and remains the only genius fashion editor,'' Richard Avedon, the photographer, said yesterday. Their professional relationship at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue was the inspiration for the movie ''Funny Face'' starring Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.         Despite a predilection for aristocratic luxury that recalled the gracious days before World War I, she had an innate understanding of the extraordinary pace of change in 20th-century life. She had an eye for what was new and imaginative, and many fashion designers say she gave them a crucial boost at an early stage in their career.         Her sense of theater was evidenced in the way she moved - Cecil Beaton described her as ''an elegant crane picking her way out of a swamp'' -and the way she looked. Her cheeks and ear lobes were rouged, her lips and nails colored a clear red and her hair lacquered black until the end of her life.         She was fashionably thin, and her favorite costume when she was working or partygoing was narrow black pants with either a black turtleneck sweater or elaborate tunic, depending on the occasion. For years she wore her hair in a snood - it became a kind of trademark - and wore ankle-strap low-heel sandals.         She was born around the turn of the century in Paris - she was never very specific about her birth date - to the former Emily Key Hoffman, an American, and her husband, Frederick Y. Dalziel, who was Scottish. She had a younger sister, Alexandra.         ''We went to Venice or Deauville in the summer or wherever everybody else went,'' she said of her childhood in Europe. ''Our parents spent their days having a good time. They never contributed a bloody thing and they and all our friends lived the life of Riley.'' Ballet and Riding         In 1914, spurred by the onset of the war, the family moved to New York, where the Dalziel sisters went to ballet classes three times a week, learned to ride from Buffalo Bill Cody and occasionally attended schools such as Brearley for a few months. Diana Dalziel made her debut in 1922, and two years later, while vacationing in Saratoga, met and married T. Reed Vreeland, a banker who graduated from Yale the year she came out.         They lived in Albany for four years and had two sons, Thomas R. Vreeland Jr., who became an architect, and Frederick, who entered the diplomatic service. Then they moved to Europe, where for a brief time Diana Vreeland ran a lingerie shop in London. When they returned to the United States in 1936, she began writing a column for Harper's Bazaar called ''Why Don't You . . . .''         For a country in the midst of a Depression, it offered such heady suggestions as ''Why don't you put all your dogs in bright yellow collars and leads like all the dogs in Paris?'' or ''have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?'' It was widely satirized and widely read and the next year she was made fashion editor of the magazine. Made a Few Mistakes         During most of the 1960's, when fashion was in turmoil, she presided over Vogue magazine, where the fashion world took everything she said seriously and where she made a few apparent mistakes, such as having experimental photographs taken with a wide-angle lens that distorted the models, giving them big heads and tiny feet. Nevertheless, fashion photographers were widely influenced by those pictures and began trying to see what their lenses could do.         She breakfasted on tea and oatmeal, worked in bed in the mornings and showed up in her office around noon.         Her legend grew as her aphorisms were circulated within the fashion world. ''Pink,'' she said, ''is the navy blue of India.'' ''The bikini is the most important thing since the atom bomb.'' She pronounced Celanese, the American fabric company, as if it were Italian: chelahnayzay, and broke down corduroy to its original components: cord du roi.         She avoided the typewriter. ''Has anyone ever written a great love letter on a typewriter?'' she asked. ''A great suicide note?'' And she made pronouncements. Of Chanel, she said, ''her first customers were princesses and duchesses and she dressed them like secretaries and stenographers.''         During this period, she asked Giorgio di Sant'Angelo, who was working in plastics and sculpture, to make accessories and then clothes.         ''She sent me to Arizona,'' he said, ''with Veruschka, the model, four suitcases full of fabrics, wires and tape and told me to wrap and tie everything as I wanted and then she gave me eight pages in the magazine.'' Two Job Opportunities         When Oscar de la Renta came to New York from Paris with a letter of introduction, she invited him to tea. He had two job opportunities, he told her, one doing custom clothes for Elizabeth Arden, the other designing ready-to-wear for Christian Dior-New York.         ''What do you want to do with yourself?'' she asked.         ''I want to get into ready-to-wear because that's where the money is,'' he told her.         ''Then go to Arden because you will make your reputation faster,'' she advised. ''She is not a designer, so she will promote you. At the other place, you will always be eclipsed by the name of Dior.''         ''That is exactly what happened,'' he said. ''And when I did go into ready-to-wear, she helped me. When I made all those gypsy clothes and the caftans in 1967, 1968, it was all Diana's suggestions.''         She had a sense of fantasy that enveloped both her own image and her friends.         ''Her thought process was very original,'' said Bill Blass, who became a friend of Mrs. Vreeland and her husband, who died in 1966. ''She always insisted I was British, no matter how many times I told her I was a hoosier from Indiana,'' Mr. Blass said. Last Career With Museum         Her last career, with the Metropolitan Museum, began in 1973 with a retrospective showing of Balenciaga's clothes, from his first collection in 1938 to the wedding dress he made in 1972 for the Duchess of Cadiz, General Francisco Franco's granddaughter, a month before he died.         The same year, she pulled together an exhibition called Innovative Designers in Paris, and each year there followed another eye-catcher that drew not only fashion enthusiasts but also people captivated by the color and drama of romantic Hollywood clothes, stylish American women (including Irene Castle, Isadora Duncan, Josephine Baker and Elsie de Wolfe), Russian peasants, the costumes of the Ballets Russes, fashions of the Hapsburg era, Yves Saint Laurent's designs, equestrian costumes, Chinese mandarin robes and dance clothes throughout history.         The parties that heralded the openings each fall became major New York events where figures prominent in art, social and fashion circles mingled for dinner and dancing in the museum; the evening was capped by a stroll through the exotically lighted display halls with appropriate music and the flash of photographers' lights. Mrs. Vreeland was in the center of the action at all the parties except the one for ''Dance'' in 1986, when her health was too fragile. 'Elegance Is Innate'         During the museum period, Mrs. Vreeland became the undisputed voice of the fashion world, and her presence at other parties and fashion openings was eagerly sought. She received awards from such diverse groups as the Italian fashion industry and the Rhode Island School of Design and she became a chevalier of the French National Order of Merit.         In a book of her favorite photographs and sketches edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and published by Doubleday in 1980, she continued her penchant for aphorisms. ''Elegance is innate,'' she wrote. ''It has nothing to do with being well dressed.'' She also said, ''I loathe narcissism, but I approve of vanity.''         In her memoirs, ''D. V.,'' published in 1984 by Alfred A. Knopf, she did not restrict her pronouncements to fashion. ''Chutney is marvelous,'' she wrote. ''I'm mad about it. To me, it's very imperial.'' And ''lettuce is divine, although I'm not sure it's really food.'' A Practical Slant         Sometimes her observations had a remarkably practical slant. ''Whatever the fashion,'' she wrote in The New York Times in 1977, ''the important thing is time for upkeep. We take it for granted that a girl gets the best she can for herself. But, if she doesn't keep it up, if it isn't in beautiful condition, if the shoes aren't cleaned before she wears them every day and her bag isn't cleaned and everything in it cleaned, she'll never look like anything.''         She was an early enthusiast on the subject of keeping fit, and the magazines she edited were filled with articles on exercise, skin and hair care and grooming long before these topics became major obsessions.         ''The body must stay fit,'' she once explained. ''Fit people like themselves much better.''         The woman who was sometimes described as having the profile of a cigar-store Indian told an interviewer once that ''you don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive,'' and her friends insist that she carried this maxim out in her own life.         ''Dinner alone with D. V. was one of the best ways I could think of to spend an evening,'' said Bill Blass.         She lived in a basically red apartment on Park Avenue decorated by Billy Baldwin with lots of pictures, patterns, bibelots and calculated clutter. When she was editor in chief at Vogue, she also had her office painted bright red. Link to Aristocratic Years         As fashion became more egalitarian during the later years of the 20th century, Diana Vreeland provided a link to the aristocratic years when it was the province exclusively of the very rich. At a time when most people were concerned with the practical qualities of synthetic fibers, she could speak of ''the feel of a perfect piece of silk'' as the ''greatest projection of pleasure.''         She had the theatrical knack of a Diaghilev, whom she greatly admired and whom she made the subject of one of her Metropolitan Museum exhibits along with the costumes for his Ballets Russes. For the increasingly computerized fashion industry, she was a symbol of the grandeur of the past when drama and imagination were all. She had a glimpse of that past in her early years in Europe. In recreating it in her later life, she smoothed out the bumps and made it seem more exhilarating than perhaps it ever was.         She is survived by her two sons, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         The funeral will be private. A memorial service is planned for the fall, with the date to be announced later.       
        Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         The Post's vice president for editorial and administration, Peter Faris, said she had died of cancer. Members of the Post staff said Mrs. Schiff had learned in May that she had cancer and had decided against being treated for it.         Mrs. Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker, used her family money to obtain the controlling stock of The Post in 1939. She sold it in 1976 to Rupert Murdoch, who sold it in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow.         Under her stewardship, the newspaper alternately made and lost money, and Mrs. Schiff constantly fretted that it would drive her into pauperdom. But she always managed to keep the newspaper afloat, seeing it outlast its competitors to become the only afternoon daily in New York City. She said in 1987 that she decided to sell the paper to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur, after The Post incurred heavy losses in the mid-1970's. Weak Competitor in '39         Mrs. Schiff bought a controlling interest in The Post in 1939 from J. David Stern at the urging of her second husband, George Backer. She had little business experience, and she later learned that she had assumed obligations for millions of dollars in severance pay if the paper closed.         Mrs. Schiff played only a peripheral role in the management of The Post in the first 10 years of her ownership. When she took active control, her new editor, James A. Wechsler, said the odds of its surviving were 1,000 to 1. Few would have challenged him. The Post was a weak third in the field of New York City afternoon dailies, behind The Journal-American and The World-Telegram, and it had been losing money for 20 years.         But the Post survived and prospered, becoming a liberal power in journalism while its powerful competitors collapsed, one by one. Even her critics agreed that most of the credit had to go to Mrs. Schiff. But they also said her success was partly attributable to personality traits for which they criticized her and to which she freely confessed: a fondness for gossip and scandal, a fear of becoming poor and a craving for power or, as she called it, influence. 'Men, Money & Magic'         Mrs. Schiff resumed her maiden name after her third divorce but decided that ''Mrs.'' was more appropriate than ''Miss'' for a grandmother. She described her private life in her diaries and other papers and in interviews. The book, ''Men, Money & Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,'' by Jeffrey Potter, was published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan in 1976.         Much of the book is devoted to her relationships with her husbands and male friends, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who persuaded her to build a home near his in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her biography suggested that their relationship had included sex and that it had been approved by Mr. Backer.         Mrs. Schiff came to regret what she called ''that awful book.'' In a statement volunteered for this obituary, she said, ''I want to make it very clear that President Roosevelt never made a suggestion that I become his girlfriend, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was just as good a friend as Mr. Roosevelt.'' Born on Fifth Avenue         Mrs. Schiff was born on March 11, 1903, in the Fifth Avenue apartment of her parents, Mortimer L. and Adele Neustadt Schiff. The apartment was a wedding gift from her grandfather, Jacob H. Schiff, a stern banker and the head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company.         As a girl, Dorothy - known to many as Dolly - was often treated coldly by her parents, each of whom had separate romantic and social interests. ''There was no joy in my growing up,'' she recalled. ''None, absolutely none.''         Later she would explain her refusal to grant bonuses or congratulations to Post staff members for good work by saying, ''They weren't given to me as a child, and any words I did receive were not ones of praise.''         She was, by her account, a bookish and sullen girl, associating solely with other young socialites at the Brearley School, Class of '20, on the Upper East Side. After her freshman year at Bryn Mawr College, where, she said, ''I flunked every single course, which is pretty hard to do,'' she set her heart on Richard B. W. Hall, a handsome socialite, though lacking in great wealth. Her parents opposed the match and, in classic fashion, sent her to Europe. But they finally yielded, in 1923. 'Rich at Last!'         Two children, Mortimer and Adele, were born in the first two years, but the marriage quickly turned cold.         After Mrs. Schiff's parents died in 1931, she said, she told her husband: ''My God, I'm rich at last! . . . And now I'm going to leave you.''         Mrs. Schiff said Mr. Hall had resented her Jewish origins as a social handicap. Shedding him, she abandoned a formal conversion to the Episcopal Church and gradually reverted to an old family concern for the fate of European Jewry.         She married Mr. Backer in 1932, because, Mrs. Schiff said, ''In those days, I thought it was important to be married, and since the substantial older ones had enough sense not to marry me, there wasn't much choice.'' Glamour and Politics         Until then, she had been, by her account, a socialite and a nominal Republican, interested chiefly in the glamour of the international set. He was a writer and a liberal Democrat, and he introduced her to the Algonquin Round Table and New Deal politics.         She joined the Roosevelt campaign in 1936 in a minor role and became active in welfare work. Three years later she gained control of The Post, ''with the understanding that I would pay the debts and the deficits,'' she said in 1987.         Mr. Backer became the nominal publisher and editor, and his wife was vice president and treasurer. She lost nearly $2 million the first two years as costs rose and circulation fell, to 190,000 from 250,000. Mrs. Schiff became terrified that the paper would bankrupt her.         She decided it needed a popular approach - a tabloid form, more comics and columns, and plenty of glamour, scandal and human-interest articles.         The features editor, Ted Thackrey, agreed. Mr. Backer did not. Marrying the Editor         Mrs. Schiff took over as publisher in 1942, separated from Mr. Backer and named Mr. Thackrey editor.         The publisher married the editor the next year, and while she was involved in buying radio and television stations, which were eventually sold, The Post under Mr. Thackrey was building circulation and cutting its losses.         The couple diverged on politics, and they publicized their disagreements in a series of columns during the 1948 Presidential campaign, he supporting the Progressive Party candidate, Henry A. Wallace, and she the Republican, Thomas E. Dewey. Both disliked Harry S. Truman, who won.         The Thackreys were divorced the next year. The Golden Age         To many readers and former Post staff writers, the era of James Wechsler's editorship, 1948 to 1961, was the newspaper's golden age. Talented reporters and columnists were hired, and although many features were about sex and celebrities, the paper also took on targets previously immune to critical coverage, like J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and Robert Moses.         From 1950 on, The Post was a money maker almost without interruption. But Mrs. Schiff never lost her sense of financial insecurity. She kept a tight rein on costs, gradually eliminating foreign and out-of-town coverage and permitting many skilled employees to leave for jobs that paid better.         She also kept a close watch on policy, conferring daily with department chiefs. Her decision in 1961 to name Paul Sann editor, making Mr. Wechsler the editorial page chief and a columnist, was generally perceived as favoring human interest over crusading.         As a publisher, she joined the strike-lockout that closed the daily newspapers in New York for 114 days beginning in December 1962. One month before the labor stoppage ended, she resumed publication because, she said, she had been snubbed in the negotiations by her male fellow publishers and because she feared that the continued stoppage might cause the death of weaker papers like The Post. Competition Dwindles         In fact, by 1966 The Daily Mirror had folded, and the morning New York Herald Tribune had merged with the big evening papers into The World Journal Tribune, familiarly dubbed The Widget.         ''I was petrified,'' Mrs. Schiff recalled. ''Here we had Jock Whitney, William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Jack Howard teaming up in the evening field.''         But an executive of the former Herald Tribune, Walter N. Thayer, reassured her, saying, ''It's an impossible three-headed thing.'' He was right. The paper closed a little more than a year later.         Mrs. Schiff then had the evening field to herself. She moved The Post from West Street to The Journal-American plant on South Street. She installed automated equipment and a spacious sixth-floor oval office for herself. The Sale to Murdoch         In December 1976, Mrs. Schiff startled the public and her staff by announcing the sale of The Post to Mr. Murdoch for $31 million. She did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed that she was pessimistic about the future of afternoon papers in the city.         ''The reason has been widely misconstrued,'' she said later in an interview. ''It was not sold for 'estate purposes.' Evening papers in urban areas have not survived. The Post had a deficit in 1975 and was a heavy loser in 1976, and I could no longer meet the deficits.''         In an interview last year, Mrs. Schiff said of her long ownership of the Post, ''It was a terrible headache.'' She said that she was then, in 1988, spending her time on needlepoint and other less stressful activities.         Mrs. Schiff married Rudolf Sonneborn, a Baltimore industrialist, in 1953. They separated in 1965 and were later divorced.         Surviving are the children of the first marriage, Mortimer W. Hall of Millbrook, N.Y., and Adele Hall Sweet, of Manhattan; a daughter from the second marriage, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, also of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
        Olga Erteszek, designer and founder of the Olga Company, which makes women's underwear and sleepwear, died of cancer Friday at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 73 years old.         Olga Erteszek, designer and founder of the Olga Company, which makes women's underwear and sleepwear, died of cancer Friday at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 73 years old.         Olga, as she was known professionally, is credited with several design innovations, including the seamless bra and the nightgown with a built-in bra. The nightgown evolved from a hospital stay for a slipped disk, she explained in an interview in The New York Times in 1966. She tested it during her convalescence, found it satisfactory and made it part of her line. It was an immediate success. ''This is comfort, security,'' she said at the time. ''This is hospital tested. I know.''         Her face as well as her name became familiar in a series of advertisements carrying her photograph and the slogan ''Behind every Olga there really is an Olga.'' A Rented Sewing Machine         The designer had immigrated to California from her native Krakow, Poland, in 1941 with her husband, Jan Erteszek, a lawyer. Shortly after arriving, they started a business with $10 and a rented sewing machine. Their first product was a lacy garter belt she had learned to make from her mother. Bullocks-Wilshire bought all the samples and the young couple were in business.         With Olga designing and her husband directing the business, the Olga Company reached a volume of $67 million when it was sold to Warnaco in 1984. Headquarters have remained in California. A daughter, Christina Johnson, is now design director of a line of lingerie for Warnaco called Olga's Christina, which is aimed at a younger, sports-oriented customer.         In addition to winning many industry awards, Olga and her husband were honored for their community and humanitarian work. In 1985, they received the California Industrialist of the Year Award for lifetime achievement. Mr. Erteszak died in 1986.         In addition to Christina Johnson, Olga is survived by two other daughters, Victoria Foote of New York City, and Mary Rudolph of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. tomorrow at the Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, Calif.       
        Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         Mary McCarthy, one of America's pre-eminent women of letters, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Castine, Me., and Paris.         In her long and prolific career as a novelist, memoirist, journalist and critic, Miss McCarthy earned recognition for her cool, analytic intelligence and her exacting literary voice - a voice capable of moving from the frivolously feminine to the willfully cerebral, from girlish insouciance to bare-knuckled fury.         In 1984, she was awarded both the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to literature and the National Medal for Literature.  'A Subversive Soul'         ''If there were any real ancestor among American women for Mary McCarthy it might be Margaret Fuller,'' the critic Elizabeth Hardwick, a friend, once observed, referring to the 19th-century American editor, essayist, poet, teacher and translator. ''Both women have will power, confidence and a subversive soul sustained by exceptional energy.''         Miss McCarthy's accounts of sexual shenanigans in ''The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt'' in 1941 and ''The Group'' in 1963 created something of an uproar when they first appeared. But her notoriety in literary circles stemmed less from the scandal quotient of her fiction than from her adversarial literary and political stands. She had celebrated public skirmishes with Philip Rahv, Diana Trilling and Lillian Hellman; issued vitriolic pronouncements on Watergate and the Vietnam War, and became known for the ferocity of her book and theater reviews.  Perverse Opinions         At their worst, those reviews pointed up Miss McCarthy's weakness for catchy one-liners and her taste for willfully perverse opinions. Of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' she wrote, ''His work reeks of literary ambition as the apartment reeks of cheap perfume,'' and of Eugene O'Neill and ''The Iceman Cometh'' she declared, ''He is probably the only man in the world who is still laughing at the Iceman joke or pondering its implications.''         Yet at her best (as in ''The Stones of Florence'') Miss McCarthy was an erudite cultural historian, using her familiarity with history, politics and the arts - and the application of some plain old-fashioned common sense -to draw surprising connections and to make her readers reconsider their preconceptions.         ''A career of candor and dissent is not an easy one for a woman; the license is jarring and the dare often forbidding,'' Ms. Hardwick said. ''Such a person needs more than confidence and indignation. A great measure of personal attractiveness and a high degree of romantic singularity are necessary to step free of the mundane, the governessy, the threat of earnestness and dryness. Moderating influences are essential.''         In the case of Miss McCarthy, she said, ''the purity of style and the liniment of her wit, her gay summoning of the funny facts of everyday life, soften the scandal of the action or the courage of the opinion.''         To Robert Lowell, Miss McCarthy was ''our Diana, rash to awkwardness,'' blurting ''ice clear'' sentences above the ''mundane gossip and still more mundane virtue'' of her colleagues. To Alfred Kazin, she was the owner of ''a wholly destructive critical mind,'' a critic with an ''unerring ability to spot the hidden weakness or inconsistency in any literary effort and every person.'' And to Norman Mailer, she was ''our First Lady of Letters'' -''our saint, our umpire, our lit arbiter, our broadsword, our Barrymore (Ethel), our Dame (dowager), our mistress (Head), our Joan of Arc.''  Heroines Were Self-Portraits         The most tireless mythologizer of her life, however, remained Miss McCarthy herself. There were her memoirs: ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' (1957), the beautifully observed portrait of her painful youth, and the later, more workmanlike ''How I Grew,'' published in 1987. In addition, the heroines in Miss McCarthy's fiction form a sort of continuing portrait of the author: Meg in ''The Company She Keeps'' (1942), the clever Vassar girl, ''a princess among the trolls''; Martha, ''the bohemian lady'' in ''A Charmed Life'' (1955), whose need to ''tell the truth'' continually gets her into trouble; Kay, the skeptical iconoclast in ''The Group'' (1963), and Rosamund, the esthetic mother figure in ''Birds of America'' (1971).         These novels also included sharp-edged portraits of many of Miss McCarthy's friends and lovers: her second husband, the critic Edmund Wilson, was portrayed as a loud, unappealing intellectual in ''A Charmed Life''; and Rahv, her roommate and mentor as editor of The Partisan Review, turned up in ''The Oasis'' (1949).         Yet if Miss McCarthy's novels often read like thinly disguised exercises in autobiography, they also attempted to provide an idiosyncratic chronicle of American life - at least within her own intellectual set - as it changed over some five decades. Sexual freedom in the 1930's, radicalism in the 40's and 50's, Vietnam and the social upheavals of the 60's, Watergate and terrorism in the 70's - these are the larger issues that flicker in the background of the novels.  Fiction Was Difficult         There is a certain didacticism to these books, a feeling of willed creation, and Miss McCarthy herself acknowledged that she found it considerably more difficult to write fiction than essays or reviews.         Each novel, she once said, had its genesis with an idea. ''Birds of America,'' which chronicled the coming of age of a teen-age ornithologist, was meant to be ''a novel about the idea of equality and its relation to nature''. ''The Groves of Academe'' (1952), a satiric portrait of a scheming scholar and his colleagues, was intended to address the question ''Where is the justice for an impossible person?'' ''The Group,'' a chatty gossip sheet about the lives of eight Vassar women, was conceived as a study of the illusory idea of social and political progress that captivated so many young people in the 1930's.         That last novel, which brought Miss McCarthy both a popular audience and a movie sale, enhanced her almost legendary reputation for enraging old friends and acquaintances who thought they saw themselves as the thinly disguised and gleefully skewered characters in her fiction.  A Painful Childhood         Throughout her career, Miss McCarthy seemed preoccupied with two themes: what she called ''the idea of justice'' and the idea of self-reliance. Both impulses originated in her painful childhood, and both, in a sense, led to her later attempts to invent an identity true to her platonic conception of herself.         Mary Therese McCarthy was born on June 21, 1912, in Seattle, the daughter of Roy Winfield McCarthy, a member of a prominent Roman Catholic family in Minneapolis, and the former Therese Preston, whose father, a transplanted New Englander, was one of Seattle's most successful lawyers. She had three brothers, Kevin, Preston and Sheridan.         The early years of Miss McCarthy's life seem to have been a romantic idyll; she would later portray them as a lovely succession of parties and holidays, with May baskets and valentines.         ''Both my parents were handsome, winning and romantic,'' she wrote. ''Their marriage was opposed by both families, partly for religious reasons, and partly because my father was an invalid, with an invalid's febrile vitality. He had a bad heart, and it was prophesied, from the first, that he would die young and leave his wife with a pack of children.''  'Dickensian Cruelty'         In fact, both he and his wife died in the great flu epidemic of 1918, and the 6-year-old Mary and her three brothers were sent to live with their great-aunt Margaret and her husband in Minneapolis. There, they experienced what she once called ''circumstances of almost Dickensian cruelty and squalor.'' The children were made to stand outdoors for three hours at a time in the snow, and they were regularly thrashed with a razor strop; Miss McCarthy recalled being beaten in one instance for receiving a school prize, lest she become ''stuck up.''         Miss McCarthy's bitter recollection continued: ''Two blocks away, my McCarthy grandparents, dwelling in sumptuous middle-class style, instilled in us the contrast between wealth and penury by occasional treats and vacations; it was thought beneficial that we should know we were orphans and fitted for a different destiny than our well-tended cousins.         ''Today, some of my relations allege my literary successes and my brother Kevin's career as an actor as proof that the harsh formula followed in our upbringing produced results; nevertheless, I cannot feel grateful. Nor do I believe that artistic talent flowers necessarily from a wounding of the stem on which it grows.''         When she was 11, Miss McCarthy was rescued from her misery in Minneapolis by her maternal grandfather, Harold Preston, who took her to Seattle and gave her a fine education at the Forest Ridge Convent and the Annie Wright Seminary.  Puritanism vs. Romance         As ''Memories of a Catholic Girlhood'' and ''How I Grew'' indicate, the twists and turns of Miss McCarthy's melodramatic childhood would develop two distinct sides to her personality: on one hand, the puritanical student who wants to win prizes for her scholarship and dreams of becoming a nun; on the other, the die-hard romantic who writes moody stories about suicide and prostitution and dreams of becoming an actress. In fact, before she left for college in 1929, Miss McCarthy took some acting classes at the Cornish Drama School in Seattle, where she met the actor Harold Cooper Johnsrud, whom she married a week after her graduation from Vassar. She would divorce him three years later.         By the time Miss McCarthy left Vassar in 1933, she said, she had become ''a wayward modern girl,'' determined, in the words of her colleague William Barrett, ''to hold her own with men - both intellectually and sexually.'' Her finely observed collection of interconnected stories, ''The Company She Keeps,'' would chronicle - in slightly disguised fashion - many of her adventures in these early post-college years, including the breakup of her first marriage, her desultory love affairs and her dabbling in Trotskyite politics.         Writing of that time, Mr. Barrett described the girlishly pretty writer as ''a Valkyrie maiden, riding her steed into the circle, amid thunder and lightning, and out again, bearing the body of some dead hero across her saddle.''         Two influential men of letters, Rahv and Wilson, would play important roles in the shaping of Miss McCarthy's career. Rahv, with whom she lived during the 1930's, helped her to get her first literary job - writing theater reviews for the magazine; Wilson, whom she married in 1938, persuaded her to try writing fiction. He put her in a room, she recalled, and told her to stay there until she finished a story. Their tempestuous marriage produced one son, Reuel, and ended in divorce in 1946. Later that year she married Bowden Broadwater, a writer and teacher.  Satiric Wit         With a clinical eye and an apparently total gift for recall, Miss McCarthy used her satiric wit to illuminate the pretensions and prejudices of her fellow intellectuals. Much of her writing was devoted to exposing what she regarded as the ignorance, bigotry, dishonest sentimentality and affectation that cluttered the intellectual marketplace.         She defended Hannah Arendt and William Burroughs when it was fashionable to assail them, and attacked J. D. Salinger, Kenneth Tynan and Arthur Miller when others were singing their praises.         The litigious Lillian Hellman was so incensed, in 1980, by Miss McCarthy's description of her in a television interview as a ''dishonest writer'' that she instituted a $2.25 million defamation suit.         Hellman's death in 1984 placed the lawsuit in limbo, making Miss McCarthy feel somewhat put out. ''I still feel disgusted by the amount of lying that didn't stop,'' she said in an interview in 1987. ''I wanted it to go to trial, so I was disappointed when she died.''  Busy Despite Health Problems         Miss McCarthy married James Raymond West, a former director of information for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in 1961. They divided their time between an apartment in Paris and their house in Maine.         In addition to her husband and son, Miss McCarthy is survived by two stepsons, Daniel West of Los Angeles and Jonathan West of Lodz, Poland; a stepdaughter, Alison West of Manhattan; two brothers, Kevin, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Preston, of Millsboro, Del., and two grandchildren.         In recent years, Miss McCarthy had several operations for hydrocephalus (water on the brain), but maintained a hectic schedule, working on another volume of memoirs, contemplating a study of Gothic architecture, teaching literature at Bard College and learning German. She recalled telling a friend some two decades ago that she ''never woke up in the morning without a feeling of intense repentance and a resolve to be better.''         ''I don't do that anymore - or almost never,'' she said in a recent interview. ''But I do have this idea of improvement, if not in one's powers, at least in one's vision, in one's understanding. I suppose it's all tied up with the American belief in progress. Not that I have that as an idea, but I certainly have it in my personal life. I couldn't live without feeling I know more than I did yesterday.''

She was 82 years old.         Gladys Burr, who spent 42 years in state institutions after being mistakenly labeled mentally retarded, died Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn. She was 82 years old.         In 1978, the state of Connecticut -convinced that Miss Burr had never been retarded - freed her, 42 years after her family had had her committed to Norwich State Hospital at age 29 because of ''trouble at home.'' In 1985, Miss Burr won $235,000 in compensation from the state of Connecticut in a suit she filed in 1979.         Miss Burr was committed in January of 1936 on the recommendation of her mother and her family doctor, a cousin. She was first diagnosed as psychotic and then declared mentally retarded. In the years that followed, a succession of mental tests, some now outdated, gave contradictory results. The first I.Q. tests showed that she was mildly retarded. Little note was taken of the fact that she had completed two years of high school and a three-month business course. Later tests, from 1946 to 1961, indicated that she had I.Q. scores ranging from 99 to 104 - considered within the normal intelligence range. A 'Living Hell'         On July 10, 1936, Miss Burr was transferred to the Mansfield Training School, which she described as ''living hell.'' She said she had been beaten, forced to work in the laundry all night and to lift patients heavier than herself.         State officials said Miss Burr did not ask to be released until 1968. But her lawyer, Richard Altshuler, said she made requests in at least three letters in the 1940's. In January 1979, she received a one-paragraph letter from the Mansfield Training School saying she was being released but without giving any reason.         In 1979, her lawyer filed a suit against a group of state mental health officials seeking $125 million and contending that they had deprived Miss Burr of her civil rights and had subjected her to slavery.         Mr. Altshuler produced reports that showed officials knew she was not retarded for more than 30 years. Miss Burr spent her remaining years in a nursing home in Colchester, Conn., and remained bitter about her experience. ''What did I do to deserve this treatment?'' she said. ''I forgive people, but I'll never understand it.''
