         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Mary Childs Black, an art historian, folk art expert, former museum director and writer, died yesterday at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said M. J. Gladstone, a friend.         Mrs. Black's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th- and 19th-century artists, attributions she based largely on social history.         Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States, Britain or Israel. She made her most important discovery in the late 1960's, when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man, Ammi Phillips, an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut. She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book "Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter, 1788-1865," which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge, folk art collectors. The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, where she had organized the first major show of Phillips's work. A Start at Williamsburg         Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg, and was named director in 1961.         She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art. In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society, where she remained as the curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts until 1982, when she was abruptly dismissed by the director, Dr. James B. Bell.         Mrs. Black protested the dismissal and was widely supported in the museum world. After a complaint was filed with Federal and state agencies contending that the society had violated sex- and age-discrimination laws, the society settled out of court, awarding Mrs. Black a sum equal to the back pay and vacation owed to her, and restoring her full pension. Dr. Bell resigned in 1988.         At her death, Mrs. Black was working on an exhibition of Colonial American painters to be presented at the New-York Historical Society, said Barbara Knowles Debs, the director and president. A Childhood Interest         Mrs. Black often said her interest in folk art stemmed from seeing Erastus Salisbury Field's 19th-century portraits of her ancestors in her grandparents' home when she was a child in Pittsfield, Mass., where she was born.         Mrs. Black graduated from the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1943, did graduate work at Catholic University in Washington and earned a master's degree in art history at George Washington University in 1952.         Her books include "Old New York in Early Photographs" (1973), "What Is American in American Art" (1971), "Erastus Salisbury Field" (1984) and "Gracie Mansion: A History of the New York Mayor's House" (1984). She was the co-author with Jean Lipman of "American Folk Painting" (1967).         She is survived by a daughter, Merrill Black of New Durham, N.H., and a grandson.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the film star who embodied not only the fantasies of millions but also aspects of the complex German psyche, was buried today in her native Berlin, where people are still not sure what to make of her.         Several hundred mourners crowded around the entrance to the small cemetery where Miss Dietrich was laid to rest. When the open black Cadillac carrying her coffin appeared, they applauded, threw flowers and called her name.         "I loved her because she was always her own person, and never did what people expected her to do," said a young man carrying a single red rose. "That's the same reason why many people here don't like her."         An elderly woman in the crowd, who said she had come out of curiosity, said she and most of her friends "didn't feel much" for Miss Dietrich.         "She was a hard person," the woman said. "As far as I know, she never did much of anything for Germany."  'Love-Hate Relationship'         The funeral marked Miss Dietrich's final return to a country with which she maintained what she once called "a love-hate relationship."         The world remembers Marlene Dietrich mainly as a composite of the alluring but stubbornly independent heroines she portrayed in screen classics like "The Blue Angel," a star who embodied romance, mystery and eroticism. Germans share those memories, but here Miss Dietrich's legacy is more complicated.         For many Germans, especially Berliners, Miss Dietrich calls up memories of the turbulent years between the two world wars. She represents the golden era when this country was one of the world's great artistic and intellectual centers, when figures like Bertolt Brecht, Walter Gropius and Albert Einstein were shaking the conventional world.         When Germany's democratic government collapsed in the early 1930's and the Nazi dictatorship began, Miss Dietrich chose exile. She lived in the United States during the war, and even renounced her German citizenship to become officially American.  She traveled to war zones to entertain and encourage American soldiers who were fighting the Nazi army.  Vowed Never to Return         Some Germans have never forgiven Miss Dietrich for those choices. On her last visit here in 1960, she had to face anonymous threats, stink bombs and a large banner reading, "Marlene, Go Home." Afterward she vowed never to return to Germany.         "When I die, I would like to be buried in Paris," she once said. "I would leave my heart to England, and to Germany nothing."         At a simple graveside service today, a Lutheran minister read the 23d Psalm and lamented the fact that Miss Dietrich "was often not understood in her beloved homeland."         The police had feared that the funeral would be disrupted by rightist groups offended by Miss Dietrich's anti-Nazi background, but no protests materialized.         Guests at the funeral included Miss Dietrich's children and grandchildren, along with politicians, diplomats and a handful of longtime friends, among them Maximilian Schell and Hildegard Knef.         Berlin's Mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, was booed when he appeared. Many Berliners have been angered and disappointed by the city's failure to mount a formal tribute.  Buried Near Her Mother         Miss Dietrich died in Paris on May 6 at the age of 90. According to her grandson, Pierre Riva, she had not left her room for five years.         Few had expected that Miss Dietrich would choose to be buried in Berlin. She said in her will that she made the choice because she wanted to lie near her mother, in Friedenau Cemetery in the Schoneberg section of the western part of Berlin.         Germany's senior political leaders were lavish in their tributes to Miss Dietrich this week.         "No one understood better than Marlene Dietrich how to combine the cool charm of a 'femme fatale' with a passionate woman's love for life," Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a statement.         "She risked a great deal when she turned her back on the Third Reich and resisted countless attempts by the Nazis to lure her back," he added.  "We admire her commitment to freedom and human rights."  Considered Traitor by Some         Miss Dietrich's return to Berlin for burial has not been universally welcomed. Several letters in newspapers this week described her as a traitor who deserved no public funeral.         "What did this woman ever do for Berlin?" one letter-writer asked.  "While we were living in misery and poverty, she was living the high life abroad."         The Berlin official responsible for cultural affairs, Ulrich Roloff-Momin, deplored such statements. He said Miss Dietrich "deserves the thanks of all Germans, because despite many appeals, she refused to be used by the Nazi propaganda machine, and on the contrary showed, together with other emigrants, that Germany was not populated only by Nazis."         City officials are under heavy criticism for the way they have handled the funeral. At first they announced that a gala tribute to Miss Dietrich's life and work would be held at the Deutsche Theater, where she began her career. But after a day and a half of confusion, they canceled the tribute, saying prominent invitees like James Stewart and Billy Wilder were unable to attend.         Newspaper columnists described the decision as scandalous and a blow to Berlin's ambition to rejoin the ranks of the world's great cities.  City Elections Due         Some commentators suggested that Mayor Diepgen and other leaders of the conservative Christian Democratic Union did not want to mount a major tribute to a figure who is unpopular in some rightist circles.  City elections are to be held next weekend.         Admirers of Miss Dietrich have been eager to show their respect. The Green party, for instance, issued a call to members to pause for one minute today to reflect on her example.         Hanna Schygulla, the German film actress, wrote in a tribute: "We, the ones born afterward, the postwar generation, are proud that there were people like you, people who during the Hitler period took the side of the enemy, and did it out of love for a better Germany."         "Mary Magedelene Dietrich is dead, but Marlene Dietrich remains," Miss Schygulla wrote. "The Blue Angel does not die."       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Sayedah Khadijah Faisal, a founder of Brooklyn's first mosque who was known to hundreds of Muslims as Mother Khadijah, died Saturday at her home at the mosque in Brooklyn Heights. She was 93 years old.         Officials of the mosque, the Islamic Mission of America, said she died after a long illness, which they did not specify.         Mother Khadijah founded the mosque in 1939 with her husband, Sheik Daoud Ahmed Faisal, who served as its imam, or spiritual leader, until his death in 1980.         She and her husband worked to bring immigrant Muslims and new American converts to the faith together in one mosque. The success of their effort was evident at her funeral there yesterday, where Muslims from Pakistan and Morocco prayed shoulder to shoulder with American black converts. The mosque is situated in a former mansion at 143 State Street in Brooklyn Heights.         During noon prayers that preceded the funeral, which was attended by several hundred people, the plain pine coffin was kept in the rear of the mosque amid a large group of women who had come to mourn. Afterward, the men of the mosque brought the casket forward for a brief service in Arabic that was centered on the belief that the deceased was merely passing on to another life.         Belquis Abdur Raheem, a teacher at an Islamic elementary school, brought seven of her pupils to the funeral. "It is important for them to see an important part of Islamic history pass on," she said. "All of these children and their parents grew up with Mother Khadijah being known to them as a focal point of Islam."         In addition to being a founder of the mosque, Mother Khadijah served as its secretary and treasurer and led its Muslim Ladies Cultural Society.         For many years, the mosque was the only one in Brooklyn and, as a result, her leadership was broader than Brooklyn Heights. She also traveled around the country with her husband, addressing women's groups on Islam.         Mother Khadijah, who was born in Bermuda, is survived by her second husband, Imam Omar Bey, and by several nieces and nephews in Bermuda.       
         Maggie Comer Robinson, whose efforts to overcome her own impoverished background and inspire her children to pursue higher education were recounted in a biography and in a television documentary, died Monday at St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, Ind. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Robinson died of septicemia, a blood infection, said a son, Dr. James P. Comer of North Haven, Conn.         Her five children earned a total of 13 undergraduate and graduate degrees, and all seven of her grandchildren are college graduates.         It was Dr. Comer's recounting of his mother's life in "Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family," published by New American Library in 1988, that brought her to the nation's attention. PBS Documentary         Her story was retold in a Public Broadcasting Service documentary, "The Legacy of Maggie's American Dream," which was first broadcast last month.         Mrs. Robinson, who was born in Woodland, Miss., and reared in Memphis, moved to East Chicago in 1920. She met her first husband, Hugh Comer, in the New Hope Zion Church, where he was a deacon. He died in 1955, and she later married Ervin Robinson of East Chicago. Mr. Robinson died in 1985.         She was a member of the Mothers Board of the New Ebenezer Baptist Church and a vice president of the Washington High School P.T.A. Among the many honors she received after her biography was published was an honorary doctorate awarded last year by Wheelock College in Boston.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Robinson is survived by two other sons, Dr. Norman D. Comer and Dr. Charles Comer, both of East Chicago; two daughters, Louise Comer of Eufala, Ala., and Thelma C. Morris of Gary, Ind.; two sisters, Susie Cossey and Carrie Watkins, both of East Chicago; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Audre Lorde, a black feminist writer who became the poet laureate of New York State in 1991, died on Tuesday at her home on St. Croix. She was 58 years old.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Blanche Cook.         Ms. Lorde had had cancer for 14 years and in 1980 wrote "The Cancer Journals," which traced the first stages of her disease.         From the publication of her first book in 1968, Ms. Lorde's 17 volumes of poetry, essays and autobiography reflected her hatred of racial and sexual prejudice. Among them are "Cables to Rage" (1970); "Coal" (1976); "Zami: A New Spelling of My Name" (1983), and, most recently, "Undersong: Chosen Poems Old and New," which was recently published by W. W. Norton.         A collection of essays, "A Burst of Light," won an American Book Award in 1989. Her 1973 collection, "From a Land Where Other People Live," was nominated for a National Book Award.  Active Politically and Academically         Ms. Lorde, who also used her adopted African name, Gamba Adisa, was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Library Science. She became an English professor at Hunter and lectured widely throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. She was active in many literary and political organizations and a founding member of Women of Color Press and Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa.         She was an outspoken lesbian and served on the board of the Feminist Press in New York City and often gave readings of her works at Judith's Room, a feminist bookstore in Greenwich Village.         Among her honors were the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit in 1991, making her the poet laureate of New York; the Manhattan Borough President's Award for Excellence in the Arts in 1988, and honorary doctorates from Hunter, Oberlin and Haverford Colleges.         Her marriage to Edwin Rollins ended in divorce.         She is survived by her companion, Gloria I. Joseph of St. Croix; a son, Jonathan Rollins, and a daughter, Elizabeth Lorde-Rollins, both of New York City, and four sisters, Helen Lorde, Phyllis Blackwell and Marjorie and Mavis Jones.       
         Paula Antoinette Neill, owner of And Why Not?, a clothing boutique in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, died on Friday after she was struck by a commuter train at the Baldwin Station of the Long Island Rail Road. She was 37 years old and lived in Baldwin, L.I.         Ms. Neill, a former dietitian, founded the boutique four years ago to showcase fashion and art by young black men and women. She was born in Jamaica and came to the United States in 1970.         Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for the L.I.R.R., said Ms. Neill's death was under investigation.         She is survived by her husband, Aubey Neill, of Baldwin; a sister, Myrna Shrouder; a brother, Ken Chong, and her parents, Zena and Linton Shrouder, all of the Bronx.       
         Charlotte Jones, an actress who appeared in plays and musicals on and Off Broadway and in regional theater, died on Nov. 6 at Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. She was 76 years old and lived in Toms River.         Her death was reported yesterday by her husband, Matteo Bocchino, who said she died of heart disease.         Ms. Jones, whose original name was Charlotte Nathanson, was born in Chicago on Jan. 1, 1916. She was a graduate of Clarke College in Dubuque, Iowa, and attended Loyola University Medical School and Loyola University Law School in Chicago. A first marriage, to Dr. Richard Jones of Chicago, ended in divorce in 1947; subsequently Ms. Jones came to New York City to make a career as an actress and dancer, and won her first role on Broadway in 1952 in the musical "Buttrio Square," starring Billy Gilbert. In 'Camino Real'         She appeared in Elia Kazan's Broadway production of Tennessee Williams's play "Camino Real" in 1953, and acted in the play again when it was revived at Circle in the Square in 1980 under the direction of Jose Quintero.         She created the dual roles of Madame Branislowski and Mother Burnside in the 1966 Broadway production of "Mame," starring Angela Lansbury; played the Wall Street widow, Mrs. Millhauser, in the 1967 Broadway musical comedy "How Now, Dow Jones," and acted with Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in 1976 in "A Matter of Gravity." She also played the role of the Fortune Teller in Mr. Quintero's Kennedy Center revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," starring Elizabeth Ashley, which came to Broadway in 1975.         Off Broadway, Ms. Jones appeared in the 1962 production of Thornton Wilder's "Plays for Bleecker Street" at Circle in the Square, in a production directed by Mr. Quintero. She also appeared in "Serjeant Musgrave's Dance" in the 1966 production at the Theater de Lys.  Over 60 Character Roles         Her other Off Broadway credits included "Red Roses for Me," "The Girl on the Via Flaminia," "The Sign of Jonah," "The Knight From Olmedo" and "The Night Is Black Bottles."         Ms. Jones played over 60 character roles in stock theater, and performed in national tours, including that of "Come Blow Your Horn." Her Hollywood films included "Muggable Mary, Street Cop," "Lovers and Other Strangers," "The Fool Killer" and "Middle of the Night."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard David Jones of Three Rivers, Mass.; a daughter, Jeanette Jones Backs of Atlanta; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Georgia L. McMurray, a leader in developing services for children in New York City, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 58.         A quadriplegic, she had been suffering from a progressive nervous disease, said the Rev. Gerald L. Wagner, a friend.         Ms. McMurray was a former Commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development and deputy general director for programming of the Community Service Society of New York.         She was teaching as a professor at Fordham University's School of Social Work at the time of her death. She was also the president of a consulting firm, the GLM Group, which provides research, training, technical assistance and other management services to governmental and nonprofit organizations concerned with programs for children and families.         Her many honors included the Essence Award this year, given to her by Essence, a magazine for black women. This year, too, the Children's Aid Society cited her for distinguished service.         Ms. McMurray managed to continue her work even though her own disabilities forced her to walk on crutches.         Ms. McMurray was a graduate of Temple University and held a master's degree in social services from Bryn Mawr College. She came to public attention 22 years ago as the founder of Project Teen Aid for pregnant adolescents, which still exists.         The Lindsay administration tapped her in 1969 to develop services for young children and families as director of an Early Childhood Task Force. Two years later she became the first head of the child-development agency, an umbrella for the city's child-care and preschool programs not handled by the Board of Education. Under her guidance the number of day-care centers multiplied and the number of children served rose from 5,000 to 40,000.         She worked at the Community Service Society from 1978 to 1986, producing reports on homelessness and the changing demographics of urban poverty, and developing model programs for children and youths.

         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Barbara Rollock, an authority on children's literature who worked for 32 years with the New York Public Library, died on Sunday at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 70 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of colon cancer, said her son David.         Joining the Public Library as a clerk at the Aguilar Branch Library in Harlem in 1945, Mrs. Rollock rose to become coordinator of Children's Services in 1974, a post she held until retirement.         For nearly a decade, she moderated the weekly show, "World of Children's Literature," on WNYC public radio, receiving the International Reading Association's media award for radio in 1982.         Mrs. Rollock was former president of the New York Black Librarians Caucas and a past president of the children's divisions of the American Library Association and the New York Library Association.         She was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in Library Science from Columbia University.         She is the author of two books, "Black Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books," published in 1992 by Garland Publishing, and "Public Library Services for Children," published in 1988 by Library Professional Publications. She also edited the 1974, 1979 and 1984 editions of "The Black Experience in Children's Literature," a bibliography, published by the New York Public Library.         Besides her son David, of Zionsville, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Howard, and another son, Phillip Theodore, also of Brooklyn.
