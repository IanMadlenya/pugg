         Mona May Karff, who won the United States women's chess championship seven times, died on Jan. 10 at her home on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. She was 86 and had been among the first four Americans to attain the rank of international woman master.         The cause was heart failure, friends said.         From the time she won her first national title at the second women's championship in 1938 until she clinched her seventh national championship in 1974, Miss Karff was in the forefront of women's chess in the United States. She and a handful of other players, among them the late Sonja Graf Stevenson, the late Mary Bain and 92-year-old Gisela Kahn Gresser, a nine-time titleholder, dominated tournament competition.         For all her victories and the wide recognition she won in American chess circles, Miss Karff, who also won four straight United States Open titles, was something of a mystery.         A refined, elegant woman who loved opera, collected art, spoke eight languages fluently, traveled the world with confident ease and made millions in the stock market, she was an intensely private person of such shadowy origins that the United States Chess Federation lists her birthplace simply as Europe, and until recently her best friend had no idea she had once been married.         In fact, according to relatives in Israel, Miss Karff, whose maiden name was Ratner, was born in the Russian province of Bessarabia, moved to Palestine when she was a teen-ager and came to the United States in the 1930's, settling first in Boston, where she had a brief marriage to a cousin, Abe Karff, a lawyer who died several years ago.         ''I knew she had a cousin in Boston,'' her friend, Bea Lacativa, said, recalling that it was not until she called the cousin's telephone number when Miss Karff was hospitalized last year that she learned that the cousin had also been her husband.         By her own account, Miss Karff was 9 when she learned chess from her father, Aviv Ratner, a Zionist who acquired a vast amount of property in Tel Aviv and later became one of the richest men in Israel.  Although she was soon defeating her father and others with ease, Miss Karff was at first so diffident about her skills that friends had to coax her to enter her first tournament. When she won handily, the diffidence was replaced by something akin to a full-blown obsession.         For all her success in the United States, Miss Karff, who was forever sailing off to Europe or South America for tournaments, fared less well in top international competition. Representing Palestine in the 1937 women's world championships in Stockholm, she placed sixth. Playing for the United States at the 1939 World Championships in Buenos Aires, she came in fifth.         The winner both times was Vera Menchik, who held the women's world title from 1927 until her death in 1944 and was one of only two women, along with Judit Polgar, a current international grandmaster, to hold their own against men in the highest levels of the game.         Like almost every other woman in chess, Miss Karff limited herself to women's tournaments, qualifying as an international woman master when the International Chess Federation created the title in 1950 to encourage women's competition.         After women's world championship competition resumed in 1950, Miss Karff represented the United States in several tournaments, always finishing well back in the field.         By then, the woman who had styled herself ''N. May Karff,'' typically without explaining what the ''N'' stood for, had moved to New York and emerged as Mona May Karff, a name she used when she made a tour of Europe in 1948 for the One World movement.         In New York, she became a fixture at the Marshall Chess Club on West 10th Street and began a long romance with Dr. Edward Lasker, a five-time winner of the United States Chess Open. Dr. Lasker was 25 years older than she, but friends recall them as a perfectly matched couple.         After Dr. Lasker died in 1981 at 95, Miss Karff continued to play regularly at the Marshall, where she was cherished both for her own achievements and as a bridge to American chess history through her association with Dr. Lasker, who won his first open in 1916 and later played a famous match with Frank J. Marshall, a longtime champion who founded the club.         She is survived by a niece, Miriam Reik, and two grandnephews, Dani and Aviv Reik, all of Tel Aviv.       
         Marilyn Costello, the principal harpist of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 46 years and a respected teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Philadelphia. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Ann Diebold, a spokeswoman for the Curtis Institute.         Ms. Costello was born in Cleveland and began her musical studies as a pianist. She made her public debut in a concert at the Cleveland Museum of Art when she was 6, and won prizes in several competitions while a teen-ager. She decided to study the harp when she was 14, after running her hands across the instrument's strings backstage at a concert of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Her principal studies were with Carlos Salzedo, the composer and harpist, at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and it was during her second year as a student there, in 1945, that Eugene Ormandy, the conductor, invited her to join the Philadelphia Orchestra. She was the orchestra's second harpist for about half a season, and was appointed principal harpist in 1946, a position she held until her retirement in 1992.         Ms. Costello joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute in 1962, and taught harpists who eventually took positions in many of the world's great orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony and the National Symphony.         She is survived by her husband, L. Daniel Dannenbaum; a son, Daniel George Dannenbaum, and two stepdaughters, Marianne Kierstead of Merrimack, N.H., and Alison Lang of Lillooet, British Columbia.       
         Sister Bernadette Szymczak, who fought hunger and despair with such loving zeal that she turned a tiny Brooklyn food program into a mighty engine of sustenance and hope, died Monday at Long Island College Hospital. She was 76 and, until six months ago, had been getting up at 5 A.M. to stir the soup and poor people's spirits as the hands-on founding director of St. John's Bread and Life Soup Kitchen.         Friends said the cause was stomach cancer.         On paper, the soup kitchen Sister Bernadette founded in 1982 at the old red-brick campus of St. John's University on Lewis Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant would seem impressive enough. The 1,000 or so hot meals it serves each weekday in the old priests' dining hall make it the largest of the 1,000 emergency food kitchens and pantries that distribute about 60 million meals a year to New York City's poor.         And its array of medical, job placement, adult education and other satellite programs have won it a reputation as a model of its kind.         But to those who knew Sister Bernadette and fell under her spell, the numbers hardly measure her impact on the lives of those most food agencies regard as clients and Sister Bernadette knew only as guests.         ''She turned my life around,'' said Bill Baker, a one-time drug addict and petty criminal, recalling yesterday that his road to personal salvation began one freezing January day a few years ago when he stopped by St. John's for a warming cup of coffee and was approached by Sister Bernadette.         Speaking with a distinct Boston accent, she posed the question that would change his life: ''Would you mind helping with the trays?''         Like countless other street toughs before and after him, Mr. Baker, who had just got out of jail, found himself on his feet taking the first steps with a load of trays that would lead him  into Sister Bernadette's world of service before self.         ''The next day I came in a little earlier,'' he said, recalling the beginning of a slow, often-painful process that would, under Sister Bernadette's gentle goading, lead him to become a full-time volunteer, to abandon drugs and, finally, to join the kitchen's small staff.         ''She never gave up on me,'' he said.         A loving tenacity seemed to be the hallmark of a woman whose guests, not always the most stable of sorts, would sometimes become so disruptive she would throw them out, then welcome them back the next day.         To most of the guests, however, she was a warm and cordial woman who knew the regulars by name, inquired after their children and set such an inspiring standard of scurrying service that it is hardly surprising that the kitchen's two-dozen scurrying volunteers are all former guests.         To the volunteers she was also cordial, unless they became too boisterous, in which case they would see the stern side of a woman who brooked no nonsense when it came to helping those in need.         A native of Boston who was orphaned as a child, Bernadette Szymczak (pronounced SIM-zak) lived for a while in a home operated by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul, the order she later joined. By the time she got to Brooklyn in 1971, she had spent 25 years working with children in homes in Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia.         For a few years after she and other members of the order established themselves in Brooklyn, at the request of the Vincentian priests who run St. John's parish, there seemed little need for a soup kitchen.         The once prosperous neighborhood had descended into poverty, but Food Stamps and other Great Society programs had all but eliminated hunger in Bedford-Stuyvesant and elsewhere, so much so that by 1980 only about 50 small soup kitchens were being operated in New York City.         Then came the Reagan Administration cutbacks of 1981, and as the need for food began to soar, Sister Bernadette, who had already established a thrift shop and an adult education program, started the soup kitchen, initially serving 15 or so meals a day.         Over the next decade and a half, as the slender woman in the plain blue habit grew frail in her work, she became a neighborhood heroine. As she walked along some of the city's meanest streets, layabouts would rise from their stoops, the faces of hardened young criminals would soften and she would be besieged with offers of assistance.         For all her charity, Sister Bernadette, whose idea of a hobby was to do a bit of sewing, then give her handiwork away, was not completely above a taste for luxury.         Friends who knew her weakness would take her out for a breakfast of pancakes or bring her a treat from McDonald's.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Rell Sunn, the Hawaiian surfer who skimmed across the waves with such sure and natural grace that she sometimes seemed at one with the sea, died on Jan. 2 at her home in Makaha on the island of Oahu. She was 47.         Ms. Sunn won international fame as a surfing champion and captured the heart of Hawaii during a stirring 14-year battle with breast cancer.         To the international surfing world, Ms. Sunn was the longboard champion who challenged the men on their own surf and helped make the sport safe for women as a founder of the first women's professional tour.         Hawaiians considered her a state treasure who used her fame to celebrate Hawaiian culture.         By the time her cancer was diagnosed in 1983, Ms. Sunn had established the credentials that would qualify her to become one of the first five women inducted into the International Surfing Museum's Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, Calif.         A native of Makaha, a small town on Oahu's leeward coast, about 25 miles northwest of Honolulu, Ms. Sunn grew up just three blocks from one of the world's most storied surfing beaches, a reef-ringed stretch of water where big waves abound and the surf is almost always up.         Riding a surfboard almost every day from the age of 4, Ms. Sunn entered her first amateur meet at 16, but quickly ran up against a hard fact of surfing life. Although women had surfed alongside men in Hawaii for centuries, since the arrival of Western missionaries in the 19th century their participation had been discouraged. In the 1950's, boys rode the boards, and girls stayed on the beach, tanning their bodies and looking good in bikinis.         With virtually no competition for women, Ms. Sunn entered men's events, almost always making the finals. By 1975, she and other pioneers, like Joyce Hoffman and Linda Benson, had inspired enough women to take up the sport that Ms. Sunn was able to help found the Women's Professional Surfing Association and establish the first professional tour for women.         Riding the waves around the world, she competed in California, Australia, South Africa, France and elsewhere. In 1982, she became the top-ranked woman on the longboard.         Ms. Sunn had a mastectomy, a bone marrow transplant and so much chemotherapy that she lost her luxuriant amber hair five times, but never her good humor. Typically, the only concession she would make to the disease was to wear a bathing cap when surfing.         After an impatient hospital stay she would wheedle permission from her doctors to return home, but only after they had made her promise to go straight to bed and stay there. As soon as she got home, Ms. Sunn would go straight to the beach. Surfing, she said, was the best therapy.         In October she was able to paddle around the island of Molokai with friends, but she weakened rapidly after that.         On New Year's Day, the woman who once described her cancer as ''the biggest wave ever,'' was taken to the beach on a stretcher to satisfy her last wish, to taste the sea on her lips one more time.         She died the next day, and two weeks later thousands of people gathered at Makaha Beach for a memorial service she had planned.         After her ashes were scattered over the water, several hundred surfers made a final ride with Ms. Sunn, whose middle name, Kapolioka'ehukai, means ''heart of the sea.''         Ms. Sunn, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Dave Parmenter; a daughter, Jan Carreira of Los Angeles; her parents, Elbert and Roen Sunn of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; a brother Eric of Makaha, and three sisters, Val Fenwick of Kailua-Kona, Anella Dehr of Makawao, Hawaii, and Kula Sunn of Haiku, Hawaii.       
         Helen Wills Moody, arguably the most dominant tennis player of the 20th century and the first American-born woman to achieve international celebrity as an athlete, died Thursday at a convalescent home in Carmel, Calif.         She was 92 and had been in failing health for several years.         She was affectionately but accurately known as Little Miss Poker Face for her dispassionate on-court behavior. Wills, who never appeared for a match without her signature stark white visor, won 31 Grand Slam titles in her 15 years of competition. She held the No. 1 world ranking for eight years and did not lose a set while amassing a 180-match winning streak from 1927 to 1933.         Match points for or against her often passed unnoticed by Wills, a  product of her legendary concentration. According to her biographer Larry Engelman, she adhered to a simple mantra during the match: ''Every shot, every shot, every shot.''         She won the first of her 19 Grand Slam singles titles as a pigtailed 17-year-old in 1923 at the national championships in Forest Hills, N.Y. Bothered by back pain and a disinclination to turn professional, she retired from tennis altogether in 1938 after winning a record eighth Wimbledon title at age 32. That record remained until 1990, when Martina Navratilova captured her ninth singles championship at Wimbledon.         Wills followed the game closely in her later years, watching matches on television, and she seemed never to have lost her competitive edge. ''She admired Martina Navratilova greatly as a tennis player who broke her record,'' said Jeanne Cherry, a Los Angeles tennis historian. ''I once asked her how she felt about Martina breaking her record, and she said, 'Well, you know, she pumps iron.' ''         No less a champion than Don Budge, 11 years her junior, called Wills ''one of my idols.''         Like Moody, Budge was born in California's Bay area. ''I remember riding to Berkeley on my bicycle to watch her practice,'' he said yesterday from his home in Dingmans Ferry, Pa.         In addition to her eight Wimbledon singles titles, Wills captured seven United States singles titles, won the French championships four times and earned gold medals in singles and doubles at the 1924 Olympics. Moody also won 12 United States, French and Wimbledon doubles and mixed doubles titles with eight different partners.         Budge was one of those who teamed with her in mixed doubles.  ''She hit the ball harder than most, except maybe Steffi Graf,'' Budge said. ''Her footwork didn't have to be great. She would control the play because she hit the ball so hard.''         Stalwart from the baseline but unafraid of ambushing her rivals at the net, Wills was less a ruthless opponent than an indefatigable one. Like her flamboyant European role model, Suzanne Lenglen, Wills used men as her practice partners, the better to overpower her contemporaries.         Reclusive by nature and dubbed the Garbo of the tennis tour by Alice Marble, one of the many opponents who felt ignored by her, Wills nonetheless lived a most public and, at times, storybook existence. Renowned for her Greek profile as well as her intimidating athletic prowess, she took tea with the British Prime Minister, was the subject of poetry by Louis Untermeyer and counted King Gustaf V of Sweden and Charlie Chaplin among her admirers. In 1930 Chaplin described ''the movement of Helen Wills playing tennis'' as the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.         Wills was an artist by avocation. She received a degree in fine arts along with a Phi Beta Kappa key from the University of California, and painted throughout her life. She was delighted to be chosen as the model for Diego Rivera's two-story mural ''The Riches of California,'' commissioned for $2,500 in 1930. Wills and the first of her two husbands, the financier Frederick Moody, invited Rivera and his wife, the painter Frieda Kahlo, to a celebratory tea after the mural's unveiling at the former San Francisco Stock Exchange.         For Wills, who confessed to suffering the intangible pangs of ''a restless heart,'' tennis and painting were the best antidotes for melancholy. She maintained an artist's studio at her residences in San Francisco and later in Carmel, once sold 40 paintings for $100 each and illustrated her own articles for The Saturday Evening Post.         Wills also became a champion of fashion, particularly on the tennis court. Like the exotic Lenglen, the first of a new breed of female tennis players who abandoned the long skirts dictated by the era, Wills advocated sensible garb on the courts and blamed trailing hemlines for women's ineptitude at the net. She termed them ''a mental as well as a physical hazard'' and always wore a knee-length pleated skirt during play.         Born in Centerville, Calif., on Oct. 6, 1905, Wills spent her childhood in Berkeley and received her initial tennis tutelage from her father, Dr. Clarence Wills. For her 14th birthday, her parents gave her a membership in the Berkeley Tennis Club, where a volunteer coach, William Fuller, arranged daily matches for her. Wills was a bit of a fanatic, playing every day and bent on defeating every opponent. At 15, on her first attempt, she won the national junior championship in 1921.         Just two years later, at 17, she became the second-youngest United States national champion by dethroning Molla Mallory, the defending champion. Wills began a lengthy tenure at the top by receiving the No. 1 Unites States ranking after their match at Forest Hills.         She went to Europe for the first time in 1924, and lost the Wimbledon final to Britain's top player, Kitty McKane. But after that auspicious debut, she prevailed in all eight of her other Wimbledon finals.         Perhaps Wills's most infamous match, and certainly the one she extolled as the focal point of her playing career, was her only meeting with Lenglen, the queen of the continent, in a much ballyhooed showdown at Cannes in 1926. Lenglen was 26 and tactically superior; Wills was 20 and physically stronger. Lenglen won the raucous encounter, 6-3, 8-6.         There was a prizefight atmosphere, with tickets scalped at a then-shocking rate of $50 each, and an international gallery of spectators that included King Gustaf, a group of stowaway French schoolboys in a eucalyptus tree at one end of the court and Wills's future husband, Frederick Moody, who introduced himself to her after the match. Wills was fond of noting that although she lost the match, she not only gained perspective on necessary changes to her game, which tended to be without nuance and relied on battering her opponents into submission with repetitious forehand ground strokes, but also gained a husband. She and Moody divorced in 1937, and she married Aidan Roark, a film writer and noted polo player, two years later. She leaves no survivors.         ''Whatever Helen did, she had to be the best at it,'' said Edward Chandler, a San Francisco attorney who was a lifelong friend of Wills. ''She never really seemed to replace tennis. She stopped playing at 82, but she was outspoken in her admiration for Chris Evert, she despised Jimmy Connors for the way he behaved and she was very happy to see Pete Sampras come along, because he seemed a throwback to the older school.''       
         Mae Questel, a rubber-voiced veteran of stage, screen and vaudeville who played Woody Allen's mother in ''New York Stories'' and was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Questel was 17 and living in the South Bronx when she won a local contest to find the girl who most resembled Helen Kane, a popular singer known as the boop-oop-a-doop queen. Ms. Questel was signed by an agent that night and soon was performing on the vaudeville circuit, including numerous stints at the Palace Theater.         She appeared in acts alongside many other performers and also as a ''single,'' using her flexible vocal cords to sing and do imitations of Maurice Chevalier, Fanny Brice, Rudy Vallee and Marlene Dietrich.         When the animator Max Fleischer heard Ms. Questel doing her boop-oop-a-doop routine in 1931, he signed her to take over the cartoon voice of Betty Boop in more than 150 animated shorts, until Fleischer retired the character in 1939. Her recording of ''On the Good Ship Lollipop,'' in Betty Boop's voice, sold more than two million copies in the 1930's.         In 1933, she created the voices of Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea for the ''Popeye'' cartoons, and played Popeye's scrawny paramour in more than 450 cartoons until they went out of production in 1967. She once told an interviewer that her Olive Oyl voice was an attempt to imitate the actress ZaSu Pitts. At various times, she also provided the voices for Little Audrey, Casper the Friendly Ghost and other cartoon characters.         Among her many Broadway credits were ''Dr. Social'' in 1948, ''A Majority of One'' in 1959 and ''Enter Laughing'' in 1963. She also appeared in the film version of ''A Majority of One'' in 1962, ''Funny Girl'' in 1968 and ''New York Stories'' in 1989. On the soundtrack of Mr. Allen's ''Zelig'' (1983) she sang the Betty Boop theme song, ''Chameleon Days.''         She is survived by a son, Richard Balkin of upstate New York, and three granddaughters.         In 1963 Ms. Questel was asked to give her philosophy for survival. ''Don't make a megillah out of every little thing,'' she said.         Correction:  January 16, 1998, Friday  A picture caption on Jan. 8 with an obituary of the actress who was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl misspelled her surname. She was Mae Questel, as the article  said, not Questal.       
         Lia Manoliu, a worldly woman who threw the discus for Romania in six Olympic Games and won the gold medal in 1968, died on Friday in a hospital in Bucharest. She was 65.         Hospital officials said the cause was a heart attack. They said she went into a coma on Dec. 31 during surgery for a brain tumor and never regained consciousness.         In 1990, after the revolution that unseated the repressive Government of Nicolae Ceausescu, Manoliu was named president of the Romanian Olympic Committee. She was only the third woman to head a national Olympic committee, following Princess Anne in Britain and Princess Nora in Liechtenstein.         Manoliu was a finalist in every Olympics from 1952 through 1972. She was the discus bronze medalist in 1960 in Rome (171 feet 9 inches). She won a bronze in 1964 in Tokyo (186-10) and a gold in Mexico City in 1968 (191-2). Then 36, she was the oldest woman to win an Olympic title in track and field. In 1972, when she was 40, she made the longest throw of her career, 203-7.         She was fluent in French, English, German and Russian. In earlier years, she was an electrical engineer who studied the effects of light and noise on factory workers. Her intellectual pursuits were endless, and she often seemed to apologize for them. In a 1971 interview in The New York Times, Brian Glanville wrote, ''She has on her bookshelves the works of Sartre, Ibsen, Pirandello and Wilde.'' To which she responded:         ''It's not me. It's the tradition in the family. My father was a professor of philosophy. That's how I had this mania to read.''         Once, in Munich, she asked a Bavarian track official about visiting a local art gallery.         ''He was amazed that someone who had been practicing a sport for 20 years should want to do that,'' she recalled. ''I felt a little humiliated. You have sport imprinted on your forehead.''         A Romanian who had known her since she was a young athlete once said, ''She has this immense compulsion to take the sins of all athletes on her shoulders.''         As an athlete, she was almost 6 feet and 187 pounds. She trained hard, sometimes jumping with 300 pounds on her back.         ''If I don't work for a month,'' she said, ''my form gets worse and worse. I have a friend, Mihaela Penes'' -- a Romanian who won the women's javelin throw in the 1964 Olympics -- ''who's endowed by nature. If she has a year's rest, it's just the same. If I stop for a month, I fall away. I wasn't gifted with this physical strength. I had to work for it all. For those moments of success, it's worth the price.''         There were other prices, too.         After she won her Olympic gold medal, her husband, Aurel Naicu, who had limited success as a discus thrower and coach, bought an expensive American car in Mexico City and sent it to Bucharest. There, he drove away with a young girlfriend. Soon after, Manoliu and her husband were divorced. They had no children.         ''I was a little in despair,'' she said, ''after 10 years of marriage.''       
         Lita S. Osmundsen, retired president of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, died last Friday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. She was 71 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was complications from pulmonary hypertension, said her husband, John A. Osmundsen.         The foundation runs programs to assist research in anthropology and related disciplines. Mrs. Osmundsen was the president of the foundation, based in Manhattan, from 1978 to 1986 and was its director of research from 1963 to 1978.         She and the anthropologist Margaret Mead received the foundation's first Distinguished Service Awards, in 1976. Mrs. Osmundsen won hers, an American Anthropological Association publication said, ''for her contribution to the internationalization of anthropology, for her furtherance of all branches of the field through support of research and for uniquely creative use of conferences and symposia to further scholarly integration and development.'' A native New Yorker, she held posts at the Wenner-Gren Foundation from 1945 to 1963. Besides Mr. Osmundsen, she is survived by twin children, Jonathan Eric, of Washington, and Mirjana Erika Dougherty of Baltimore; her father, Irvin Binns of the Bronx; a sister, Heather Habeger of New City, N.Y.; a brother, Roger Binns of Wayne, Pa., and one granddaughter.       
         Helen Billings Burnham, a one-time real estate woman with no legal training who spent 22 years dispensing justice, sometimes from her family room, as a part-time, round-the-clock town justice in Salina, N.Y., died on Thursday at her home in Mattydale, a suburb of Syracuse. She was 81 and had retired in 1993.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         As a judge who never went to law school, Mrs. Burnham was hardly an anomaly. Only about a quarter of New York's 2,000 or so local court judges have law degrees.         Even so, when the Salina town board named her to succeed her husband, Richard, as town justice after he was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971, there were those who thought she did not belong on the bench. Her husband's friends, she recalled, told her it was not a job for a lady. After all, although town justices mainly handle traffic offenses and small claims disputes, perform wedding ceremonies and preside over misdemeanor cases involving penalties of no more than a year in jail, those who are hauled into court are rarely the most reputable of citizens. And the duties of a town justice also include arraigning accused murderers and other desperate felony suspects, sometimes in the middle of the night.         Mrs. Burnham, a large, imposing woman who had run her own real estate business and served as her husband's clerk during his nine years as town justice, was not intimidated.         ''I became a judge and stopped being a lady,'' she said.         The appointment, which made her the 16th woman to serve as judge in New York and the first in Onondaga County, was not popular with her husband's Republican allies.         At the end of the year, when the Republicans named a man to run in a special election to fill out her husband's term, Mrs. Burnham felt miffed enough to leave the Republican Party but not enough to become an actual Democrat. So she blithely switched her enrollment to the Conservative Party, picked up the gleeful endorsement of local Democrats and won the election.         After that, neither the Republicans nor anybody else bothered to put up a candidate against her. Running unopposed, she won five more four-year terms.         A native of Earlville, N.Y., Mrs. Burnham attended the Utica School of Commerce and moved to Mattydale, a Salina hamlet, in 1952 when her husband, who was a lawyer, took a job with an insurance company in Syracuse before starting a private practice there.         By the time of her husband's death, Mrs. Burnham had spent enough time in his courtroom, an attached garage that had been converted to a family room, to know pretty much what to expect.         Over the next two decades she dispensed justice with such consistent compassion, good humor and common sense that in 1989 the National Judges Association named her the outstanding non-attorney judge in the United States.         Shortly before she became town justice, Salina had provided a courtroom in the municipal office building, but except for scheduled traffic court evenings and the like, until she closed it in 1980, Mrs. Burnham performed most of her part-time judicial duties at her real estate office.         But as a town justice on call 24 hours a day, she did not bother to redecorate the old family room.         In a sequence that became a familiar drill, Mrs. Burnham would be awakened by a midnight call from the sheriff's office, get out of bed, slip her black judicial robe over her nightgown and be ready, gavel in hand, when the latest felony suspect was brought in for arraignment.         For all her work on criminal cases, Mrs. Burnham was best known for her weddings.         She performed more than 3,000 marriage ceremonies, earning the nickname ''the marrying judge,'' in part because when it came to marriage, Mrs. Burnham was a judicial romantic who would go just about anywhere anytime in the cause of Cupid.         Over the years, she presided at poolside weddings, one in an airplane, another on horseback and on more than a few occasions at hospital maternity wards a few contractions ahead of the bride's baby.         After she stepped down as town justice, Mrs. Burnham was named Salina's town historian and produced two books, one a history of Mattydale, and the other, ''The Room on the Side of the House,'' an account of her judicial experiences.         A fun-loving, outspoken woman who learned to curb her tongue during her years on the bench, Mrs. Burnham relished her retirement.         ''Now I'm not a judge or a lady,'' she said. ''I can say and do whatever I want to.''         She is survived by two sons, Richard of Virginia Beach, Va., and William of Cicero, N.Y.; four daughters, Jeanne Steffanelli of Portsmouth, Va., Linda Bamberger of Mattydale and Candice Jost and Cynthia Morris of Syracuse; 15 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Sayre, a short story writer turned scientific sleuth who helped establish the important role played by the British crystallographer Rosalind Franklin in the discovery of the structure of DNA, died on Friday at a hospital near her home in Bridgewater, N.J. She was 74 and the author of the 1975 book ''Rosalind Franklin and DNA.''         Her husband, David, said the cause was scleroderma, a rare rheumatoid disorder.         Until Mrs. Sayre's book was published by Norton in 1975, Rosalind Franklin had been little more than a footnote to the history of the discovery of the double helix, the form taken by deoxyribonucleic acid, the stuff of heredity.         In their 1953 paper in the British journal Nature, James D. Watson and Francis H. C. Crick, who first constructed a model of the DNA molecule, barely mentioned Dr. Franklin and gave her none of the credit for their conceptual breakthrough.         A decade after Miss Franklin's death in 1958 and six years after he, Dr. Crick and Dr. Franklin's associate, Maurice Wilkins, won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA, Dr. Watson provided a hint of Dr. Franklin's contribution.         In his 1968 best-selling book ''The Double Helix,'' Dr. Watson acknowledged that he had seen a diffraction X-ray photograph of the DNA molecule taken by Dr. Franklin, but he left it unclear just what role the photograph had played in the discovery a few weeks later of the DNA structure.         That role might have remained a mystery if Dr. Watson had not provided such an unflattering portrait of Dr. Franklin that it outraged many international crystallographers.         It might yet have remained a mystery if within months of the book's publication, the world's crystallographers had not held their triennial meeting on Long Island, at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, practically next door to the Sayres' longtime home in the North Shore village of Head of the Harbor.         As it happened, Mrs. Sayre's husband, a crystallographer then working for I.B.M., was a host of the meeting, and he and his wife, who had met Dr. Franklin in Paris in the late 1940's, spent a lot of time listening to the visiting scientists complaining about Dr. Watson's portrayal of Dr. Franklin and speculating on whether her photograph had played a significant role in the discovery of the DNA structure.         At the urging of the crystallographers familiar with her work as a short story writer, Mrs. Sayre agreed to do a book on the subject. After years of research, including a stint in England, she produced the 1975 book. Among other things, it established that the Franklin photograph had been far more important than had been acknowledged in leading Dr. Watson and Dr. Crick to their discovery of the DNA structure.         Indeed, in Mrs. Sayre's book, Dr. Crick went so far as to suggest that Dr. Franklin was just weeks away from making the DNA discovery herself when her unscrupulous associate Dr. Wilkins showed the photograph to Dr. Watson without her permission.         Dr. Watson has since acknowledged the role played by the photograph in the DNA discovery, but has continued to disparage Dr. Franklin, saying yesterday that she had not been a real crystallographer and had missed the significance of her own photograph.         Nevertheless, Mrs. Sayre's book has been widely cited in feminist circles for helping to expose rampant sexism in science.         Mrs. Sayre was already familiar with sexism elsewhere in society.         Born on a train passing through Milwaukee, Mrs. Sayre, who grew up in Woodmere, N.Y., was a brilliant student who majored in government at Radcliffe, but was dissuaded by the sexual barriers of the day from going on to law school.         After holding a series of jobs in advertising and magazine publishing, Mrs. Sayre, who met her husband while working briefly at a radiation laboratory in Cambridge, turning out short stories, some of which were included in annual anthologies.         Before her 1975 book on Rosalind Franklin, Mrs. Sayre had written just one other book, a well-received 1957 book for teen-agers, ''Never Call Retreat,'' about a Quaker family living in the South during Reconstruction.         Working on the Rosalind Franklin book helped prompt Mrs. Sayre to redress an old feminist complaint of her own.         She received her law degree from New York University, worked for a while as a volunteer Legal Aid lawyer in Riverhead, N.Y., then in the late 1980's became town justice in Head of the Harbor, a post she held until illness forced her to step down in 1996.         Her husband is her only survivor.         Editor's Note:  July 8, 1998, Wednesday  An obituary on March 18 about Anne Sayre, an author, described a book she wrote in 1975 about the role of Rosalind Franklin, a British biologist, in the discovery of the structure of DNA 45 years ago. The article recounted an incident in 1952 in which Maurice Wilkins, a colleague of Dr. Franklin's, showed other scientists in the field an X-ray photograph she had taken.         In describing the incident, the article called Dr. Wilkins ''her unscrupulous associate.'' While some biologists question the prudence of what he did with her photograph, the consensus is that it was not unscrupulous. The term should not have appeared.         This note was delayed by an editing lapse.       
         Hilda Ginsburg Schwartz, a retired justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who was a mentor and role model for many female lawyers, died on March 18 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         She was among the first women to reach the New York bench at any level and was a judge for 24 years after a stint as the city's Director of Finance. She served on the city's Magistrates Court and Civil Court and she retired from the State Supreme Court in 1983 at 76.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from New York University and, in 1929, from its law school. She joined 9 other women in 1934 to found what is now the 2,000-member Women's Bar Association of the State of New York, and served as its president.         Mayor William O'Dwyer appointed her secretary of the New York City Board of Estimate in 1946, and his successor, Vincent R. Impellitteri, put her on the Magistrates Court in 1951. She served until 1958, when Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her city treasurer.         In 1962, she became the city's first Director of Finance. In 1965, Mayor Wagner made her a Civil Court judge and she won election to a 10-year term the next year. She was elected a State Supreme Court justice in 1971.         During her tenure as Director of Finance, she created an important indicator of the city's economic health, the New York City Excise Tax Guide, as a resource for businesses, lawyers and individual taxpayers, as well as for the city administration. It compiled data, regulations, laws and source materials culled from the city's excise taxes.         Her husband of 52 years, Herman N. Schwartz, died in 1982.         She is survived by a son, John M., and a sister, Edith Smolen, both of Manhattan.       
         Celestine Tate Harrington, a quadriplegic street musician whose buoyant personality and unremitting chutzpah brought astounded smiles to everyone who watched her play the keyboard with her lips and tongue on Atlantic City's Boardwalk, died on Feb. 25 at the Atlantic City Medical Center. She was 42.         She died of complications resulting from critical injuries she suffered in a traffic accident on Feb. 19.         Mrs. Harrington was born with a congenital joint condition that eroded the connective tissue in her arms and legs, leaving them immobile stubs, but she never seemed to consider herself disabled. Her daily street performances in front of Bally's Park Place Casino and Caesar's Palace, where she performed ''Amazing Grace'' and ''Stormy Weather'' on an electric synthesizer, were studies not only in the art of music, but also in the art human self-salvation.         Mrs. Harrington was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and her father abandoned her when she was 6 years old, family members and a friend said.         Raised by her maternal grandparents, a construction worker and a registered nurse, she eventually became a parent herself. In 1974, in downtown Philadelphia, she met John Smith, a nursing home aide who courted her while she lived at the Moss Rehabilitation Clinic in Philadelphia. She bore him a daughter, Nia, in 1975, but before the couple could marry, Mr. Smith died.         The death led the courts to seek custody of Nia. Mrs. Harrington won the right to raise her child in 1976 by demonstrating to a dumbstruck judge what she could manage: she changed the baby's diaper with her teeth.         Three years later, she met a construction worker, Stanford Williams. In 1979, they, too, had a daughter, Coronda, but never married.         Mrs. Harrington learned to play the keyboard at Philadelphia's Settlement Music School. Soon afterward, she decided to take her newfound skill downtown, where she played for change on the sidewalk in front of Wanamaker's department store. But Atlantic City -- bustling with tourists and extra change -- beckoned. She arrived on the Boardwalk in 1984, and she eventually moved into a condominium in Atlantic City purchased with the proceeds from her busking.         She often boasted that as much as $100,000 a year was dropped into her plastic bucket, though friends and relatives gently dispute that claim.         Though Mrs. Harrington eventually started a tiny enterprise designing business cards, her main interest was her music, and her repertoire of solemn ballads like ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' and patriotic hymns like ''America the Beautiful,'' quickly made her a redemptive presence in a gambling town. They also won her a following among the Boardwalk's casual strollers.         By 1989, Mrs. Harrington was a beloved presence, partly because of the remarkable figure she cut: a 4-foot, 10-inch tall, 190-pound woman moving swiftly, lying on her stomach, head up, , through the city streets on a motorized gurney that she guided with a steering device worked by her chin. But she was also known for the inspirational message she spread as a guest on national talk shows or to people she met on the Boardwalk with whom she formed close relationships.         Among them was her husband, Roy Harrington, a casino maintenance man who came along in 1990. In the next year, the couple married and adopted Charles Graves, the son of a former boyfriend.         In addition to her husband and three children, Mrs. Harrington is survived by two sisters, Agnes Tate-Sanders and Tamogene Tate, both of Philadelphia, and a brother, Jay-Cee Tate of North Carolina.         Another person that Mrs. Harrington befriended was Camille LeClair, co-owner of a McDonald's restaurant in Atlantic City who hired her last year to take phone deliveries.         A poignant memory of Mrs. Harrington was on her mind last week when word came that she had died. On one occasion when Mrs. Harrington was in her house, Mrs. LeClair said: ''I hopped in the shower and when I came back I said to Celestine, 'Why does God allow me to jump in and out of the shower in 10 minutes, but you have to struggle so much?'  Well, Celestine just looked at me and said, 'That's why I'm here. To keep reminding you to count your blessings every day.' ''       
         Laurie Beechman, the throbbing-voiced singer and actress who played Grizabella in the Broadway musical ''Cats'' for more than five years, died on Sunday at her home in White Plains, N.Y. She was 44.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her agent and friend, Jim Wilhelm.         An emotive belter in the tradition of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, both of whom were her girlhood idols, Ms. Beechman brought a waifish pathos and a piercing vocal power to her character's signature song, ''Memory.''         Whether on Broadway, on a concert stage or in a cabaret, Ms. Beechman conveyed a strong involvement with her material, delivering the climaxes of big ballads with a full-throated, sobbing intensity.         Ms. Beechman was born in Philadelphia, attended New York University and made her Broadway debut in 1977 in the ensemble of ''Annie.''         Venturing into the pop arena, she  made an album, ''Laurie and the Sighs'' (Atlantic), that presented her as a rock belter in the mode of Pat Benatar. When the album sold poorly, she decided to stick to the worlds of theater and cabaret and returned to Broadway as the narrator in ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Her performance in that show won her Tony and Drama Desk nominations for best featured actress in a musical.         In 1983 she took the role of Grizabella in the national touring company of ''Cats'' with the proviso that she step into the part on Broadway when Betty Buckley departed. The chance came four months later.         In the late 1980's and 90's, Ms. Beechman became a cabaret and concert performer who often blended popular standards and theater songs with light rock-and-roll. She also recorded four more albums.         Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 1989. Despite her illness, she joined the national touring company of ''Les Miserables'' in the role of Fantine, performing in the touring production of ''The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Sunset Edition,'' and singing ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' at President Clinton's 1997 inaugural gala. Last spring she rejoined ''Cats'' in time to be playing Grizabella when the show surpassed ''A Chorus Line'' as Broadway's longest-running hit.         She is survived by her husband, Neil Mazzella; her parents, Dr. Nathan and Dolly Beechman Schnall of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Jane Segal and Claudia Cohen, both of Philadelphia. A funeral will be held tomorrow at 11 A.M. at J.  Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel, 7112 North Broad Street, Philadelphia.         Ms. Beechman became an advocate and role model for people with cancer. ''The perception people have of cancer,'' she told The New York Times, ''is that you're cured or you die, and that's not necessarily how it works. It can be more like diabetes, a part of life.''       
         Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said.         Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She  brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ''could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''         She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ''I am not a centrist.''         Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.         After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.         Even then, she continued to rankle.  Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ''I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement.''         When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ''He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate.''         Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ''would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.         But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.         In Congress, ''she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ''She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war.''         Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ''Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ''Bella,'' ''I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure.''         She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.         She made friends easily, too. ''She's fierce and intense and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ''She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare.''         Her First Speech, In a Subway Station         Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ''this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.         She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.         Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ''When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.         ''After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did.''         All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ''I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together.''         In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.         She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.         In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.         During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.         The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan  to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a  solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.         Campaign Became A Women's Crusade         At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.         Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.         To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for  day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.         She got little of this, but during the next six years ''she was indefatigable,'' Ms. Newberg recalled. ''She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ''her agenda was too pure for her moment in time.''         Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ''sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of  the women's equal rights amendment. ''She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.         From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.         She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.         For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along,  Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.         Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader  estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''         Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''         Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''         Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.         She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''         Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career         Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the  Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.         Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.         In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ''I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.         She was appointed co-chairwoman  of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ''I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job.''         Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.         It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ''I haven't been entirely the same since.''         There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.         During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ''Gender Gap,'' with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.         In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.         ''I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,'' Ms. Abzug said of herself in ''Bella.'' ''They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy.''         ''There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman.''       
         Baroness Lestor of Eccles, a crusading British politician who spoke out against apartheid in defiance of her Government's policies and who struck a blow on behalf of single mothers when she won the right to adopt two children on her own, died in a hospice in London on Friday. She was 66 and had been suffering from motor neurone disease.         Lady Lestor had two great causes in her life: the fight against racism and the fight for the rights of children, and was never afraid to criticize her party when she disagreed with its policies.         She was briefly chairman of the Labor Party in 1977-78 and served as a junior minister in several Labor Governments in the early 1970's, but was perhaps too uncompromising in her beliefs to rise to a higher office. She was, an admirer once said, ''the heart and soul of the Labor Party.''         Joan Lestor was born on Nov. 13, 1931, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents steeped in the international labor movement. Her mother, Esther, had been a machinist in a textile factory in East London who, as a teen-ager, became a shop steward for the garment workers' union; her father, Charles, a journalist and actor, was a leading member of the Canadian Socialist Party and later, when the family returned to England, of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.         Ms. Lestor graduated from London University with a diploma in sociology and went to work as a nursery school teacher, opening a nursery school in her own home six years later. At the same time she pursued a career in politics. Disillusioned by what she considered the extremism of her father's party, she joined Labor at the age of 24, won several local elections and was elected to Parliament in 1966. She remained there, with a four-year break, until 1997.         She immediately threw herself into the issues that consumed her, introducing a bill to tighten regulations on nursery schools and providers of child care; fighting the Government's attempt to stop paying social security benefits to unwed mothers, and working to insure that abandoned wives could obtain financial support from their husbands.         She was passionate about the rights of abused children, saying in a 1989 debate that while it was necessary to ''strike a balance'' between the rights of children and the rest of the family, ''in my book, the rights of the children are paramount.''         Her jobs in the Labor Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan often became jeopardized by the rigor of her principles. In 1974, when she was appointed a junior minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for African affairs, she earned the nickname ''the African Queen'' and repeatedly clashed with her superiors over her strong anti-apartheid views.         Ms. Lestor was then moved to a ministerial job in the Education Department. But she resigned after a year in protest over spending cuts that threatened the jobs of thousands of teachers and forced the postponement of her goal to change the age when students left state-financed secondary schools to 16, from 15.         With the Conservatives in power through the 1980's and into the 1990's, Ms. Lestor worked as the opposition's chief spokeswoman on a number of issues, including children and the family, juvenile crime and race relations. She resigned from her last opposition post, as spokeswoman for overseas development, in 1996, saying that she was too ill to continue.         In 1997 she was made a Baroness and elevated to the House of Lords.         A flamboyant, warmhearted woman who listed her hobbies in Who's Who as ''playing with children and animals,'' Lady Lestor relished adversarial politics and was not shy about telling people what she thought, in the plainest possible language.         When she heard that Rupert Allason, a fellow Member of Parliament and an espionage expert, was about to accuse her publicly of spying for the K.G.B., she confronted him and showered him with invective. ''Perhaps I used words no lady should,'' she conceded later.         She was married briefly as a teen-ager in 1948, but the marriage was dissolved and she never remarried. She wanted children, nonetheless, and fought for the right to adopt them herself, despite being single.         When she won her case, she cried with happiness, and went on to adopt her son, David, in 1967, and her daughter, Susan, in 1969. She loved being a grandmother, and caused roars of laughter in Parliament when she announced, in a wicked nod at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had grandly used the royal ''we'' in noting the birth of her first grandchild, that ''we too became a grandmother.''         When she received her peerage, she said she celebrated by baking muffins for her grandchildren; having them, she said, was ''even better than being in love.''       
         Kasey Cisyk, an opera-trained singer who never made it to the Met but whose haunting coloratura soprano became one of the world's most listened-to voices, died on March 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 44 and had been the singing voice of the long-running ''Have You Driven a Ford Lately?'' advertising campaign.         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         In the capricious world of show business, she never enjoyed splashy success, but in the backwaters of her profession, where most singers, after all, spend their entire careers, Miss Cisyk, a tiny, slender woman with a smile as big as her heart, made her share of waves.         She worked as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Quincy Jones; she dubbed the Oscar-winning title song for the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life,'' and in the demanding world of commercial jingles, she was a star, one whose very anonymity was a critical asset.         It allowed her, for example, to amass a list of credits that included such archrivals as ABC, NBC and CBS; McDonald's and Burger King, American and Delta airlines and even Coke and Pepsi.         And for all her long run with Ford, Miss Cisyk also sang in the service of Chevrolet, Cadillac and Toyota.         It was her work for Ford that made her the envy of her colleagues. From the time she became the voice of Ford in 1981 until the campaign was finally retired two months ago, hers was the most ubiquitous voice in the land. In 1989, when the campaign was nearing the midpoint of its 17-year run, an industry record for a corporate soloist, Ford executives estimated that Miss Cisyk had been heard by a cumulative audience of 20 billion.         Maybe not what she had in mind when she was studying opera at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, but not at all bad for a Queens-born daughter of a Ukrainian virtuoso who wanted her to play the violin.         Miss Cisyk, whose father maintained a studio on the Lower East Side, learned the instrument when she was 5 (she also studied ballet), and after graduating from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, she dutifully accepted a violin scholarship to Mannes.         By the time she graduated she had switched to classical voice training, won encouraging praise for roles in student opera productions, and sung  ''Rigoletto'' in Ghent on a New York State scholarship in Belgium.         For all her promise, Miss Cisyk, whose father died when she was 17, was drawn away from opera and into the world of jingles by the pressing need to make a living.         She found work singing in clubs in New York, but for a while in the mid-70's she despaired of breaking into the tight-knit world of commercials. For months after she had circulated tapes to advertising agencies she heard nothing.         Then the executives got around to listening to the tapes, and the calls started coming in, slowly at first, but after six months of sporadic work, an entire industry seemed to make the simultaneous discovery that her voice was money in the bank.         Suddenly she was in such demand that a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 A.M. session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at 11, Hartz Mountain at 1 P.M., Eastern Airlines at 2, Datsun at 3, L'Eggs at 5, McDonald's at 6, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 P.M. to 3 A.M.         By the time Ford came calling in 1981, she had learned to pace herself.         After an early marriage and divorce, she married Edward J. Rakowicz, a recording engineer, had a son, Edward W., now 7, and became as devoted a mother as she had been a dedicated singer.         But even after her cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and she began the long, painful ordeal of therapy, Miss Cisyk, who is also survived by her older sister, Maria, a concert pianist and teacher who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., continued to work, singing her last professional jingle just a few months ago.         She may never have made it to the Met or even had a popular hit record in the United States, but she was not a complete unknown in the world of music.         Miss Cisyk, whose given name was Kvita (Ukrainian for flower), adopted the professional name Kasey from her initials, intending to reserve Kvita for an opera career that never happened. She eventually found a use for it after all.         A woman who cherished her Ukrainian heritage, Miss Cisyk formed her own production company in 1988 and recorded two C.D.'s, one  (''Kvita'') of Ukrainian folk songs, the other (''Kvita Two Colors'') of Ukrainian love songs.         Both have been wildly popular among the 100 million far-flung Ukrainian expatriates and in Ukraine, where the woman who worked in the backwaters of American show business was regarded as a leading performer and is very much a household name.       
         Laila Twigg-Smith, an art collector and philanthropist, died on March 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 53 and had recently moved to Manhattan from Honolulu.         The cause was liver failure, said Christopher English Walling, a friend.         A trustee of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, she was also a member of its capital campaign steering and accessions committees, and was particularly involved in planning the new bookstore that opened as part of the museum's recent renovation. She was a member of the national committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art and of its painting and sculpture committee. In 1991 she won the Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Award from the Skowhegan School in Maine.         Ms. Twigg-Smith, who had been married to Thurston Twigg-Smith, former publisher of The Honolulu Advertiser, had lived since 1970 in Hawaii, where she and her husband had put together a substantial collection of contemporary art. They divorced two years ago.         She was instrumental in starting the Contemporary Arts Center in Honolulu and was active as an exhibition juror, lecturer, curator and teacher there. From 1980 to 1985 she was Commissioner of Visual Arts for the City and County of Honolulu. In the 1970's she wrote art reviews for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin.         She was also an artist with a particular interest in the print media and had studied art in college in California and later in Hawaii. She was known in the art world as a charismatic figure, with a sharp and enthusiastic eye for new art.         She is survived by a son, Cade Roster, of Honolulu.       
         Dr. Viola Wertheim Bernard, a prominent New York psychiatrist who found ways to help adopted and foster children feel at home in new surroundings, died on March 21 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91 and also lived in Nyack, N.Y.         Her prescription for easing the way for adopted children into a new home was to arrange for them to visit the new place in advance. ''Helping children to see where they are going reduces the fear of strangeness,'' she advised.         Throughout her professional life, she worked to widen the applications of psychoanalytic theory to study and tackle social problems. A past vice president of the American Psychiatric Association, she won international recognition for her work in community and social psychiatry, child psychiatry and adoption.         In an association with Columbia University that spanned five decades, she founded its Division of Community and Social Psychiatry and directed it from 1956 to 1969. She was also a founder of what is now the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. At her death, she was clinical professor emeritus at the Psychoanalytic Center for Training and Research at Columbia.         Dr. Bernard opened her Upper East Side medical practice in 1940 as a specialist in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. The author of about 100 papers and several books, she recently finished her latest article on the relevance of psychiatry and psychoanalysis in social contexts,  said Kathleen L. Kelly, an executor. It will appear in the forthcoming issue of The Psychoanalytic Review.         Dr. Bernard's writings also addressed topics like children and adolescents and their position in family, community and the law; mental health and the schools; community and social psychiatry and training, and the dynamics of psychiatry among the poor, particularly among minorities.         A Manhattan native, she graduated from New York University in 1933 and earned her medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1936. She trained in psychiatry and neurology at Jersey City Medical Center, Grasslands Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., and the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Hospital.         Dr. Bernard leaves no immediate family. She was married in the 1930's to Theos C. Bernard, an anthropologist, who died in 1948, 10 years after their divorce.       
         Frances B. Sonz, a retired painter and art teacher in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., died on April 12 at her home in Tiburon, Calif., where she had lived for 10 years. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Sonz grew up in New York City and earned a degree in fine arts from the Pratt Institute. She also earned a master's degree in teaching at New York University.         She exhibited her work at Manhattan galleries and won first place in a juried show in 1966 at the Salmagundi Club, the nation's oldest sketch club, when she became the first woman to receive the club's President's Award. Her prize winner was a pastel still life.         She taught art at Dobbs Ferry High School until 20 years ago and continued her painting in the San Francisco Bay area until last December.         Mrs. Sonz is survived by her husband, Ben Sonz Sr.; a daughter, Ann Mantranga of Sausalito, Calif.; two sons, Benedict Sonz Jr. of Bethesda, Md., and Paul Sonz of Mill Valley, Calif.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.       
         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         Loren MacIver, a painter of dreamlike, half-abstract landscapes, city views and close-ups of natural forms, and a close friend of many American poets, including Elizabeth Bishop, E. E. Cummings and Marianne Moore, died on May 3 at her home in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, where she had lived and worked since the early 1940's. She was 90.         Apart from taking Saturday classes at the Art Students League in Manhattan in 1919, when she was 10, Ms. MacIver was self-taught, a fact perhaps reflected in her eclectic, highly personal style. She often painted houses or rooms where she lived in New York or Paris, using oil paints with the delicacy of watercolors to create a mood of light-bathed Proustian reverie.         ''My wish is to make something permanent out of the transitory,'' Ms. MacIver wrote in 1946, in a three-paragraph artist's statement, the only one she ever composed. ''Certain moments have the gift of revealing the past and foretelling the future. It is these moments that I hope to catch.''         In 1929, Ms. MacIver married Lloyd Frankenberg, a poet, and they maintained a close professional relationship all their lives. (Mr. Frankenberg, who died in 1975, wrote a series of poems inspired by Ms. MacIver's paintings.)         Ms. MacIver claimed to have had no professional ambition. ''I never thought of painting as a career,'' she once said. ''I cannot tell you how casual it was. I never intended to be a painter. I just like to paint.''         It was only in 1935, after her husband, without her knowledge, showed her work to the director of the Museum of Modern Art, Alfred H. Barr, that she began her career. Mr. Barr bought one of her paintings for the museum and another for himself.         While working for three years on the Depression-era Federal Art Project, Ms. MacIver had her first individual show, in 1938 at Marian Willard's East River Gallery, and won praise early on. (Alfred Stieglitz wrote a short catalogue introduction for the show, declaring, ''This girl should be given a chance to paint, if anybody should be given a chance to paint.'')         Her next New York show was in 1940, at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, which represented her until 1990, when it closed. She showed at Terry Dintenfass in 1994, and most recently  was represented by the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, which mounted a career survey of her paintings and drawings last winter.         Ms. MacIver had several museum retrospectives: at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1953), the Phillips Collection in Washington (1965), the Montclair Museum of Art in New Jersey (1975) and the Newport Harbor Museum, now the Orange County Museum in California (1983). She was the recipient of numerous grants, including ones from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rothko Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dorothy Spence Briley, the editor in chief and publisher of Clarion Books and a vice president of the trade and reference division of the Houghton Mifflin Company, died last Sunday at her home in New York City. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Karen Spence.         Mrs. Briley was born in Nashville and graduated from Vanderbilt University. She worked first at the Methodist Publishing House in Nashville, then in 1962 joined its children's department, Abingdon Press, in New York City. She later worked at Viking Press and E. P. Dutton, then led the children's departments at Van Nostrand, J. P. Lippincott and Lothrop, Lee & Shepard.         She moved to Clarion in 1989. In recent years, Clarion titles have won the Newbery and Caldecott Medals, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award and the Hans Christian Andersen Award. Mrs. Briley edited the acclaimed biographies by Russell Freedman and illustrated books by David Wiesner and Jim Murphy, among others.         Mrs. Briley's two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by a son, Michael Spence of New York, and a grandson.       
         Alice Faye, one of the few movie stars to walk away from stardom at the peak of her career, died yesterday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was in her mid-80's.         The cause was cancer, according to her publicity company, Jewel Baxter, which said she had had two stomach tumors removed last month.         Ms. Faye's warm, husky contralto and demure sexuality in ''Tin Pan Alley,'' ''Hello, Frisco, Hello'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' made her one of Hollywood's top 10 moneymaking stars in 1938 and 1939. Under contract to 20th Century Fox for a little over a decade, during which she made 32 movies, Ms. Faye walked out in 1945 after Darryl Zanuck, the studio's leader, chopped up her scenes in ''Fallen Angel'' to highlight the performance of a younger Fox star, Linda Darnell.         Ms. Faye handed the keys to her dressing room to the studio gate guard and drove off the lot.         ''When I stopped making pictures,'' she told an interviewer in 1987, ''it didn't bother me because there were so many things I hadn't done. I had never learned to run a house. I didn't know how to cook. I didn't know how to shop. So all these things filled all those gaps.''         It was that attitude of taking life as it came without shaking her fist at fate that informed many of her screen performances. She was the honest, good-hearted girl who stood by her man. And when that man did her wrong, her response was to sing a torch song and love him harder. Off screen she had an unlikely but happy marriage to the brash band leader Phil Harris, whom she married in 1941. Hollywood gossip columnists gave the marriage six months, but it lasted 54 years, until Mr. Harris's death at the age of 91 in 1995. They had lived for many years in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.         Ms. Faye, whose original name was Alice Leppert, was the daughter of a New York City policeman and grew up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Although some books list her birth date as 1912, she insisted she was born in 1915 but had lied about her age when she joined the Chester Hale vaudeville troupe at 13.         After several years in the chorus,  Alice Faye, still a teen-ager, got a job on Broadway in ''George White's Scandals of 1931,'' which starred Ethel Merman, Ray Bolger and Rudy Vallee. She sang ''Mimi'' at a cast party, and Mr. Vallee hired her as a singer on his radio show. When  ''Scandals'' was made into the Fox film ''George White's Scandals of 1934,'' Ms. Faye replaced Lillian Harvey as Mr. Vallee's love interest.  Mr. Vallee's wife sued for divorce, naming Ms. Faye as his love interest off screen as well.         Fox put Ms. Faye under contract and presented her as a brassy imitation Jean Harlow in movies like ''She Learned About Sailors'' and ''King of Burlesque.'' After Mr. Zanuck's 20th Century Films merged with Fox in 1935, the studio softened her image. Jack Kroll of Newsweek once called her ''a luscious marshmallow sundae of a girl,'' and her ripe figure fit the many period movies like ''Little Old New York'' and ''In Old Chicago'' in which she sang to Don Ameche, Tyrone Power or John Payne from the stage of a saloon.         Mr. Ameche lost her to Mr. Power in ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ''In Old Chicago'' but won her affections in ''You Can't Have Everything,'' ''Hollywood Cavalcade,'' ''Lillian Russell'' and ''That Night in Rio.''         It was the one-two punch of ''In Old Chicago'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1938 that made Ms. Faye a top box-office draw. A year later she and Mr. Power were teamed for the last time in ''Rose of Washington Square,'' a fictionalization of the Nicky Arnstein-Fanny Brice story that was later the basis for the Broadway and Hollywood musical ''Funny Girl,'' which starred Barbra Streisand. Ms. Faye had been responsible for Mr. Power's stardom. In 1936, when he was only an extra, she insisted that Fox test him.         Her voice was inviting, and Irving Berlin once said he would choose Ms. Faye over any other singer to introduce his songs. In 1937, George Gershwin and Cole Porter called her the best female singer in Hollywood. In ''Rose of Washington Square,'' with tears in her eyes, Ms. Faye poured her love and faith in her no-good man into ''My Man.'' But the song with which she is most closely associated is the Academy Award-winning ballad ''You'll Never Know'' from ''Tin Pan Alley.''         An early marriage to Tony Martin, a singer, ended in divorce after three years when Ms. Faye had become a star and Mr. Martin had not succeeded in the movies. When she remarried, she said, she was determined not to let that happen again. She and Mr. Harris were the parents of two daughters by the time she walked off the Fox lot after ''Fallen Angel.''         Ms. Faye had tried to change her screen image in that film noir melodrama, as the wife whose husband wants to dump her for the character played by Ms. Darnell. When she saw how Mr. Zanuck had edited the movie, she decided it would be a failure, telling an interviewer decades later, ''I couldn't see anything coming for me but the same old dumb things.''         So she spent the next eight years raising her children and appearing with her husband on a successful Sunday evening radio program, ''The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show.''         Ms. Faye is survived by her daughters, Alice Regan and Phyllis Harris; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         In 1962 Ms. Faye returned to 20th Century Fox as Pat Boone's mother in a poorly received remake of ''State Fair.'' In 1973 she toured in a revival of ''Good News,'' and in 1976 joined other golden-era stars in cameo roles in ''Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.''         In 1984 Ms. Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, encouraging ''young elders'' to live a healthy life. In 1990, she was co-author of a book, ''Growing Older, Staying Young,'' with Dick Kleiner.         Reminiscing about her years at Fox, Ms. Faye described the studio as a kind of penitentiary.         ''So I decided to make a new life for myself,'' she said. ''A home life. I had been chauffeured to work, made up, dressed, given my meals and chauffeured back home. I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be independent. I equated independence with seeing daylight during the week and learning how to drive a car.''         Correction:  May 11, 1998, Monday  An obituary of the actress and singer Alice Faye in some editions yesterday misidentified the source of the song ''You'll Never Know,'' which won an Academy Award in 1944. It was from the film ''Hello, Frisco, Hello,'' not ''Tin Pan Alley.'' The obituary is reprinted today on page A15 for readers who did not receive it.

         Dame Catherine Cookson, a determined dockside waif who spun the dross of a squalid childhood into gold as one of Britain's most prolific and best-read novelists, died yesterday at her home in a Newcastle suburb. She was 91 and the author of more than 90 novels with a combined distribution of more than 100 million copies.         There's not much to be said for growing up coal poor in Tyneside, the industrial banks of the Tyne in northeastern England, even less for being shamed by an alcoholic mother and never knowing your father.         Then again, by the time she was finished, Dame Catherine had said quite a lot about the grim life she knew as a girl and illuminated in scores of novels, almost all of them set in the same working-class world she grew up dreaming of escaping.         British readers have not seemed to be able to get enough of Dame Catherine's gritty tales of family conflict, social despair and the debilitating effects of deprivation. Dame Catherine has not only regularly accounted for a third of the books circulated by Britain's lending libraries, but of the top 10 titles on last year's circulation list, nine were hers.         Yet she would have been hard-pressed to dream up a more unlikely heroine or a tale as compelling as the story of her own life.         Who, after all, would believe that a woman whose childhood humiliations included frequenting pawn shops, collecting driftwood from the Tyne, being sexually molested at 7 by her mother's boyfriend, and making daily runs to the pub to fetch her mother and tyrannical grandfather pails of beer would become a successful novelist?         Or that a woman whose adult tribulations would include the pain of four pregnancies ending in miscarriage and stillbirth and a devastating nervous breakdown would make an emotional breakthrough at 40, find salvation through writing and end up as Britain's 17th richest woman, with a fortune estimated at $23 million?         Even harder to believe is that Dame Catherine credited the spark that saved her life to her persistent belief as a girl that she was a lady.         It was a belief, she said, that was fired when an aunt mentioned that her father, a topic she could never discuss with her imperious mother, had been a gentleman. And what sort of gentleman would take his pleasure, then abandon a woman he had got with child? As the aunt explained, ''he wore an astrakhan collar, and he carried a silver-mounted walking stick and kid gloves. And, oh yes, he talked lovely.'' (Dame Catherine later speculated that her father had been a gentleman's footman.)         The notion that she had been born a lady took a startling turn when Dame Catherine, then known as Katie McMullen, read in a novel that it was a lady's duty to be educated, which she took to heart, beginning a lifelong habit of reading great books.         She found her immediate escape from poverty by working in laundries, rising to supervisor, saving her money, moving to the southeastern city of Hastings and opening a rooming house for men.         One of her lodgers was a shy, intellectual school teacher named Tom Cookson, and as Dame Catherine later told it, it was close to love at first sight. When she asked him in for coffee after their first movie date, the two sat up talking until after midnight. ''Now,'' she said, ''whether it was him, or whether it was me who first leaned to the other I don't know. But we kissed and that was that.''         After their marriage the couple were inseparable, but after experiencing a stillbirth and three miscarriages Mrs. Cookson, who suffered from a lifelong blood disorder, endured years of suicidal depression until her husband suggested she try to overcome her despair by writing.         Her first book, an autobiographical novel called ''Kate Hannigan,'' was published in 1950, when she was 44, and Mrs. Cookson was on her way. Averaging two books a years, she achieved something of a breakthrough in 1968 with her 19th novel, ''Katie Mulholland,'' and her autobiography, ''Our Kate.''         Although none won literary acclaim, a number of her books, including ''The Black Candle,'' and ''The Velvet Gown,'' were made into television movies, and Mrs. Cookson, an Officer of the British Empire since 1985, was made a Dame, the equivalent of a Knight, in 1993.         Her husband is her only survivor.       
         Maureen O'Sullivan, a leading Hollywood actress in the 1930's and early 40's best known for playing Jane to Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan in the series of popular jungle adventure movies, died yesterday at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 87. Ms. O'Sullivan, who was the mother of the actress Mia Farrow, had homes in Phoenix and Grantham, N.H.         One of the brightest of ingenues, the actress appeared in more than 60 films, from ''Tugboat Annie'' to ''Pride and Prejudice,'' starring with everyone from Robert Taylor to the Marx Brothers. But she was always identified with the lovely, legendary Jane, teaching the niceties of civilization and romance to the yowling Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs's King of the Jungle. It was a notable pairing of opposites.         Her other movie successes included ''The Thin Man,'' ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street,'' Greta Garbo's ''Anna Karenina,'' ''A Day at the Races,'' ''A Yank at Oxford,'' ''The Crowd Roars'' and ''David Copperfield'' (with W. C. Fields).         Ms. O'Sullivan never studied acting and was modest about her talents, telling a 1986 interviewer: ''I didn't pretend to be an actress. I just tried to be natural, the best I could.''         In another interview, she recalled that the praise she received in 1935 for her performance in the death scene of a child bride in ''David Copperfield'' was not because of her skill, but because of the directorial wizardry of George Cukor. ''They raved about my agonized look and the tears in my eyes,'' she said, ''but it was all because George was twisting my feet off camera.''         She retired from full-time filmmaking in 1942 to bring up the children (eventually seven) she had with her husband, John V. Farrow, a movie writer, director and producer, and made only occasional films until 1963. In that year, Mr. Farrow died of a heart attack. She then moved her family from Southern California to Manhattan.         In 1962, she made her Broadway debut in Sumner Arthur Long's ''Never Too Late,'' playing opposite Paul Ford as a suddenly expectant middle-aged wife. Both also appeared in the movie version of the comedy. After that, Ms. O'Sullivan had an active career as a Broadway actress, starring in ''The Subject Was Roses,'' ''Keep It in the Family,'' ''No Sex Please, We're British,'' ''Charley's Aunt'' and the charming 1980 revival of Paul Osborn's ''Morning's at Seven.''         Woody Allen gave Ms. O'Sullivan her most luminous screen role, when she was 75, in his 1986 hit ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' in which her children included her daughter Mia. The script required the aristocratic Ms. O'Sullivan to call herself ''a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.''         In her major scene, she resumes drinking after her husband (Lloyd Nolan) has repeatedly berated her for flirting with a young television crewman while the couple were acting in a commercial.         Hailing her performance, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that Ms. O'Sullivan ''never had five minutes on the screen to equal her work here.''         Ms. O'Sullivan compared Mr. Allen favorably to Mr. Cukor, who was renowned for his skill in directing women.         ''George had a preconceived idea, and he made you do his concept of what he wanted,'' she recalled. ''I liked working with Woody more because I felt he would, in his gentle way, find out in you what you could do and let you do it.'' After the highly public breakup of Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow, Ms. O'Sullivan was very outspoken about siding with her daughter.         Maureen O'Sullivan was born on May 17, 1911, in Roscommon, Ireland, to Maj. Charles Joseph O'Sullivan and the former Mary Lovatt Fraser. She was educated in convents of the Sacred Heart in London, Dublin and Paris. Desiring an acting career, she read widely and concentrated her studies on writing and music.         When she was 18, she had a chance meeting with Frank Borzage, the American director, who was in Dublin filming ''Song o' My Heart,'' starring the celebrated tenor John McCormack. She passed a screen test to perform as his daughter and went to Hollywood to complete the film. She appeared in several more Fox movies and then won longterm contracts with MGM.         She was first matched with Weissmuller in ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' in 1932. As Jane Parker, Ms. O'Sullivan was rescued by Tarzan and chose to stay with him in the jungle. Five other Tarzan pictures followed. The last with the two actors (and Cheetah the chimpanzee) was ''Tarzan's New York Adventure'' in 1942.         Her later films included ''Peggy Sue Got Married,'' Francis Coppola's 1986 fantasy in which her granddaughter (played by Kathleen Turner) visits her from the future. ''There's nothing to worry about, dear,'' Ms. O'Sullivan lovingly assures her. ''You're just browsing through time.''         The actress's honors included a Roman Catholic Interracial Council's 1980 award as ''a distinguished Catholic who has worked to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society.''         Ms. O'Sullivan also wrote ''The Umbrella'' and other short stories.         In 1983, she was married a second time, to James Cushing, a construction company executive.         In addition to Mr. Cushing and Mia Farrow (who lives in Connecticut), she is survived by five other children, Patrick and Theresa, both of  Vermont, John Jr. of Maryland, Prudence of Iowa, and Stephanie of New York City; 32 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Michael, her oldest son, was killed in a plane crash in 1958.         As the matriarch of a very large family, she was asked about off-screen motherhood. ''The real way to bind children to you is to let them go,'' she said. ''Clutching is no good; it simply makes them determined to be rid of you. But once they're free, they surprisingly want to come back to you as friends.''         Ms. O'Sullivan was irritated at times about the repeated references to her as Tarzan's Jane, but later accepted it as a kind of folkloric signature.         She said that the famous line ''Me Tarzan, you Jane'' was improvised on the set. The two actors were sitting on a high branch of an MGM tree, and Weissmuller pretended that he was pushing her off, and she pretended that she was pushing back. He said, ''Jane.'' She said, ''Tarzan.'' He said, ''Jane.'' Then he said, ''Me Tarzan, you Jane,'' and the director said, ''Keep it in the script.''       
         Harryetta Peterka, director of instruction of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, died on Tuesday at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was injuries sustained when she was struck by a bicycle messenger while crossing Madison Avenue in front of the academy on May 28. As director of instruction, Ms. Peterka supervised students enrolled in the school's two-year professional training program and served as artistic director of the Academy Company.         Born in Charleston, Ill., Ms. Peterka attended the academy herself after graduating from Eastern Illinois University. Upon her graduation from the academy in 1958, she won  the Charles Jehlinger Award, the school's highest student honor, and toured professionally as a member of the Academy Repertory Company. She performed Off Broadway and in regional theater, and appeared with Christopher Reeve in ''The Complaisant Lover.''         She is survived by her husband, William Damon of Manhattan; a sister, Nancy Keiser of Springfield, Mo., and a brother, John, of Fargo, N.D.       
         Josephine Hutchinson, a stage and film actress who gained prominence in the 1930's and early 40's, died on June 4 at the Florence Nightingale Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 94.         After studying as a child at the Cornish School in her hometown of Seattle, Ms. Hutchinson left for several years of stock work in New York and Washington before joining Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater while in her early 20's.         As a leading player she won critical acclaim, particularly as Alice in the Civic's 1932 production of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Petite, with golden-red hair framing her heart-shaped face, Ms. Hutchinson said her interpretation was inspired by her mother's ''cleanliness-is-next-to-godliness technique of dressing little girls.''         In 1934 she left New York for Hollywood to become a contract player at Warner Brothers, making her screen debut in Mervyn LeRoy's ''Happiness Ahead'' in 1934. Melodramas and period films followed, including ''The Story of Louis Pasteur'' (1936), starring Paul Muni.         After withdrawing from acting in 1941, Ms. Hutchinson returned in 1946 in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ''Somewhere in the Night.'' Small roles followed in films including  ''Love Is Better Than Ever'' (1952), starring Elizabeth Taylor; ''North by Northwest'' (1959), starring Cary Grant, and ''Baby, the Rain Must Fall'' (1965), with Steve McQueen.  She appeared in episodes of the television series ''The Twilight Zone,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''Gunsmoke'' in the late 1950's and early 60's.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Galina Brezhnev, the high-living daughter of the former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev whose antics often led to scandal, died today in a Moscow hospital. She was 69.         Russian news agencies said she is to be cremated on Wednesday. There were no details about the cause of death.         Galina Brezhnev was never involved in politics but she figured in some major scandals in the last years of Soviet power. The arrests of some of her husbands and some of her friends illuminated corruption of the Soviet aristocracy.         A hard-drinking member of the Soviet elite who liked to race her father's Mercedes, Ms. Brezhnev had her first brush with scandal when she was just 22 and ran away with a circus acrobat.         ''He could hold 10 people on his shoulders but failed to hold Galina too long,'' NTV television observed tonight. ''Galina got married quite often.'' She remained infatuated with the circus and with circus performers for several decades.         In 1982 a close friend from the circus, known as Boris the Gypsy, was arrested and charged with smuggling. The arrest took place when Yuri V. Andropov was head of the K.G.B., and Mr. Andropov portrayed the move as part of his anticorruption drive. But it was also interpreted as a bid by Mr. Andropov to position himself to succeed Mr. Brezhnev as Soviet leader. Mr. Brezhnev died in 1982.         That was not the end of her notoriety: In 1988 her husand Yuri Churbanov was arrested for taking bribes and imprisoned for six years. Mr. Churbanov had been a lieutenant colonial in the police when he met Ms. Breznev and was promoted to post of Chief Deputy Interior Minister soon after their marriage.         Coming in the early years of reform under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Churbanov case sent an important political signal: that no one was above the law.         After Mr. Churbanov was jailed, Ms. Brezhnev said she was unaware of his bribe-taking and divorced him, saying he had been a bad husband. Mr. Churbanov was released from prison in 1993.         Despite her brushes with scandal, Ms. Brezhnev retained her privileges and comfortable life style. She  won a law suit for the return of a Mercedes and other valuables confiscated from Mr. Churbanov.         There were no details tonight about survivors.       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Juanita Kidd Stout, an Oklahoma music teacher turned Philadelphia lawyer who became the first black woman to serve as a judge in Pennsylvania, then spent the better part of 40 years as a judicial scourge of murder, mayhem and bad grammar, died on Friday at a hospital near her home in Philadelphia. She was 79 and throughout a long pioneering legal career had been first and foremost an English teacher.         Friends said the cause of death was leukemia.         It may not say much about Pennsylvania that the first black woman to gain a seat on a state bench was born in Wewoka, Okla., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa and studied law at Indiana University, but it is to the state's credit that once Judge Stout established a practice in Philadelphia in 1954 it did not take the local legal community long to recognize that it had gained a treasure.         Within two years she had been appointed to the District Attorney's office, where she promptly extended her reputation as ''the hardest working lawyer in Philadelphia.'' Getting up at 4 A.M. seven days a week to study law, cases and evidence, she became so well-known for her preparation, and for her successful prosecutions, that it seemed hardly surprising that she would win swift appointment to the bench.         When she did, in 1959, on an interim appointment to the old Philadelphia Municipal Court, she came up for election two months later and won handily, becoming the first black woman in the country to win election to a court of record.         She was later appointed to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, where she specialized in homicide cases. In 1988, she received an interim appointment to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, making her the first black woman in the country to be a judge on a state's highest court, a position she held for a year, until she turned 70, the court's mandatory retirement age, and returned to the bench in Philadelphia.         She dealt firmly with offenders and despised crime, but seemed to reserve her greatest fury for what she perceived as its underlying cause, an almost willful ignorance, especially among defendants who had dropped out of school without learning to read and write.         Slackers could expect no leniency, but if she saw a glimmer of remorse and a spark of resolve to do better, Judge Stout, who had a fine eye for the line between teen-age excess and hard-core crime, could be accommodating. One gang member who was sentenced to time at reform school rather than at a harsher correctional facility, later became her law clerk and went on to establish a large law firm.         In one of her more celebrated cases, while assigned to juvenile court in 1965, within 24 hours after a white sailor from Georgia was severely beaten while trying to defend a 16-year-old white girl from being raped at a subway station by eight black gang members, Judge Stout had tried, convicted and sentenced seven of the thugs to long prison terms and placed the eighth on probation.         ''Rape today, jail tomorrow,'' she suggested, might be an effective deterrent.         This and several other long sentences she imposed on violent gang members over the next few weeks made Judge Stout such a hero in Philadelphia that when the executive director of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sent form letters to members of the Philadelphia bar protesting her ''swift justice,'' he received so many angry replies that he sent a second letter, beginning, ''I am sorry that our criticism of Judge Stout has upset you.''         Her tough stance made her a pariah to local gangs, and when her mail included a number of death threats, Judge Stout was predictably outraged. The grammar was atrocious, she said, and the letters were riddled with misspellings.         Indeed, she gave so many impassioned lectures on the importance of education that youthful defendants learned to assure her that they attended school regularly, a tactic that might have worked more often if Judge Stout had not learned to check school attendance records.         She routinely sentenced first-time offenders to write long essays, and was such a stickler for proper usage that she blithely corrected her fellow judges' grammar, and woe betide the lawyer who sought to ''appraise'' her of something.         ''I know my value,'' she would snap. ''Now if you want to apprise me, get on with it.''         When lawyers sought leniency for their youthful clients on the ground that they had deprived upbringings, Judge Stout was unmoved. ''We didn't have indoor plumbing until I was 13,'' she once said, rejecting poverty as an excuse for crime.         She might have grown up poor, but her parents were both teachers, and Judge Stout, who credited her mother with instilling her lifelong habit of hard work, learned to read at 3, entered the third grade at 6 and started college at 16, first at a black school in nearby Missouri and later at the University of Iowa before returning to Oklahoma as a music teacher.         For all her later education, she credited her accidental legal career to a high school shorthand course. Seeking work in Washington in World War II, she landed a job at a law firm and was so good at taking legal dictation that she began to study law, first in Washington and later at Indiana University, where she obtained two law degrees while her husband, Charles Otis Stout, was studying for his doctorate. He died in 1988.         When one of the Washington firm's partners, William H. Hastie, was named to the Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in 1950, he hired his former stenographer as administrative assistant, a position she held until she entered private practice a few years later.         Throughout her career Judge Stout lectured widely, invariably stressing the importance of using correct English, especially when she addressed law students.         In recent years, as she was showered with honors, she modestly suggested they were undeserved but she could hardly complain. The citations hailing her myriad accomplishments were letter perfect.       
         The Mexican writer Elena Garro, whose novels, plays and stories exploring the clash between illusion and reality in Latin America made her one of Mexico's most important literary figures behind her former husband, Octavio Paz, died on Saturday at  Cuernavaca Hospital, south of Mexico City.         She was 78 and had emphysema, said her daughter, Helena Paz Garro.         While male voices predominate in Latin American literature, Ms. Garro, through acerbic intelligence and lyric intensity, achieved a level of recognition and importance usually barred to women. The president of the National Council for Culture and the Arts in Mexico, Rafael Tovar y de Teresa, labeled Ms. Garro one of the three most important female writers that Mexico had produced, alongside the 17th-century nun and poet Sor Juana de la Cruz and Rosario Castellanos, Ms. Garro's contemporary.         The Mexican literary world ''is in mourning again,'' said Mr. Tovar y de Teresa. Mr. Paz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, died on April 19.         In the Mexico City daily Reforma, the writer Carlos Fuentes called Ms. Garro's first book, ''Recollections of Things to Come,'' ''one of the most important Mexican novels of the 20th century.'' It is one of only a handful of her more than 40 works that was  translated into English.         Ms. Garro was born in the pretty colonial town of Puebla, 75 miles from Mexico City. Her marriage to Mr. Paz in 1937 brought her into a circle of intellectuals where her own radical ideas flourished and eventually clashed with those of her contemporaries.         Soon after marrying, she and Mr. Paz moved from Mexico City to Spain to write about the Spanish Civil War. They lived in Paris after World War II and became part of the literary group that included the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges and the Surrealist Andre Breton. Later they lived in Japan before returning to Mexico.         Their marriage dissolved in the early 1960's and they never spoke to each other again.         In the late 1960's, Mexico, like many other countries, was immersed in protest and rebellion. The Mexican student movement had been fired in part by the country's intellectual elite. But Ms. Garro turned her back on the movement, at one point calling it a ''crazy adventure.''         Her remarks stirred open hostility and brought about an almost complete break with Mexico's literary community. She moved to New York, and later to Paris, remaining in exile for 23 years before returning to Mexico in November 1991.         She found a changed country, which she found hard to accept, and became like a character in ''Recollections of Things to Come'' who tried to step out of time by stopping the clock at the end of every day.         Still, Ms. Garro continued to write provocatively and successfully. This  March, the English translations of two of her novellas, ''First Love'' and ''Look for My Obituary,'' were published by Curbstone.         In a review in The New York Times, Peter Bricklebank said the works possessed ''understated eloquence,'' with characters who are ''prisoners of their own solitude, shackled by social expectations.''         Besides her novels and stories, she  wrote eight works for the theater, including ''A Solid Home'' (1957), ''The Tree'' (1963) and ''Felipe Angeles'' (1979). Upon her return to Mexico in 1991, she was honored for her life's work at the National Theater Program in Aguascalientes.         Ms. Garro spent her last years with her daughter and more than a dozen cats in a two-bedroom apartment in Cuernavaca.       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.       
         Anna Jane Harrison, an emeritus professor of chemistry at Mount Holyoke College and the first woman to be president of the 150,000-member American Chemical Society, died on Aug. 8 at Holyoke Hospital. She was 85 and lived in nearby South Hadley, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, the college said.         Dr. Harrison was born on a farm in Benton City, Mo. Her early education was in a one-room country school, and she returned to teach there for two years after graduating from the University of Missouri in 1933.         She then earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, also at Missouri, and started her college teaching career at Sophie Newcomb College of Tulane University in 1940.         She joined the faculty at Mount Holyoke College as an assistant professor in 1945, rose to professor in 1950 and headed the department of chemistry from 1960 to 1966.         She became the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Chemistry in 1976 and held that post until she retired in 1979.         Dr. Harrison received 20 honorary degrees and won awards from the American Chemical Society in 1977 and 1982 for her contributions as a teacher.         She was active in the society for 62 years and became its president, for a one-year term, in 1978.         Dr. Harrison also served on the National Science Board in the 1970's.         In addition, she was a longtime board member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1984 became its president.         She has no immediate survivors.       
         Minerva Bernardino, a major force behind the founding of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and a pioneer among Latin American feminists, died on Aug. 29 in the Dominican Republic. She was 91.         Ms. Bernardino, who was appointed a representative of the Dominican Republic at the United Nations in 1950, was one of only four women to sign the United Nations Charter in 1945. At the Charter conference in San Francisco, she insisted that the document include the phrase ''to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination against race, sex, condition or creed.''         A contemporary of Eleanor Roosevelt, whose passions for human rights she shared, Ms. Bernardino joined Mrs. Roosevelt and three other women who were delegates to the first United Nations General Assembly in 1946 -- Jean McKenzie of New Zealand, Evdokia Uralova of the Soviet Union and Ellen Wilkinson of Britain -- in writing an ''Open Letter to the Women of the World'' calling on women to take a more active role in politics and government.         She was vice chairman and then chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Women from 1944 to 1949, the first regional body set up to advance the rights of women.         ''Ms. Bernardino spoke up for women in the aftermath of World War II, understanding that life for women would never be the same, '' said Kristen Timothy, deputy director of the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women.         Ms. Bernadino, born in Seibo in the Dominican Republic, was the granddaughter of a provincial governor and one of seven children in a family that was unusually liberal on women's rights.         ''My mother was very progressive and I was reared in an atmosphere that was, at that time, most unusual in my country,'' she once told The Christian Science Monitor in an interview. Her father also encouraged her independence.         When she was orphaned at 15, her lack of inhibitions about women working led her into a career in the civil service. Meanwhile, she was studying for a bachelor of science degree.         By 1929, she was active in the women's rights movement in the Dominican Republic, where she was a leader in Accion Feminista Dominicana, which led the fight for expanded rights in the 1942 Constitution.         In her long life of fighting for women's and children's rights, Ms. Bernardino won many honors. In 1995, she was awarded the Hispanic Heritage Award for excellence in education in Washington. On the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in 1997, she was honored in a speech by Secretary General Kofi Annan, who called the commission ''to an important extent her creation.''         Ms. Bernardino was also known in Latin American for her sustained opposition to strongmen -- she went into what friends described as self-imposed exile to demonstrate her opposition to the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in her own country -- and for her work on international panels dedicated to making the region a zone of peace.       
         Annabelle Irwin, a retired Iowa State English professor who drew on her experience as a high school teacher in collaborating on an acclaimed series of books for young teen-agers, died Sept. 13 at a daughter's home in Des Moines. She was 82, and with Lee Hadley had formed the writing team known as Hadley Irwin.         Her daughter Sara Thompson said the cause was complications from hepatitis C.         When Mrs. Irwin and her young partner, Lee Hadley, also an Iowa State English professor, put their heads and names together in the early 1970's, their target audience was 12- to 16-year-olds, an age group known in the publishing trade as young adults.         Specializing in what are known as problem books, the women produced 13 Hadley Irwin titles for the McElderry imprint at Simon & Schuster.         The books dealt with serious themes in such detail that it is little wonder that Mrs. Irwin's children, who appear in various guises throughout the series, would want the world to know that their mother did not draw on their experiences in exploring problems like teen-age suicide (''So Long at the Fair''), alcoholism (''Can't Hear You Listening'') or racism (''Kim/Kimi''), let alone incest, the breakthrough subject of the 1985 Hadley Irwin book, ''Abby, My Love.''         But Mrs. Irwin really did not need her children as models. A native of Peterson, Iowa, Mrs. Irwin, whose maiden name was Bowen, grew up on a farm, majored in music at Morningside College in Sioux City and spent 30 years teaching, first music and later English, at a series of high schools in Iowa and Illinois.         By the time she returned to school at age 50 to pick up a master's degree at the University of Iowa and qualify for a college position, Mrs. Irwin, who joined the Iowa State faculty in 1969, had seen enough teen-agers to fuel her literary career.         In a collaboration in which she  took the lead in plotting and Ms. Hadley specialized in characters, Mrs. Irwin drew on the experiences of students she had taught in high school in developing the books' anguished themes.         Over a quarter of a century the women developed a sure-fire system, beginning their books during summer vacations at Mrs. Irwin's lakeside home in Lake View, Iowa, then revising them during the school year, sometimes sitting side by side at the same typewriter and finishing each other's sentences.         The novels won respect in the publishing industry, led to a couple of television movies and sold steadily in the United States, Europe and Japan, though not enough to make the authors wealthy.         The last Hadley Irwin book, ''Sarah With an H,'' which dealt with anti-Semitism, was published after Ms. Hadley's death at 60 in 1995.         Afterward Mrs. Irwin sought to carry on alone under the name Ann Irwin, writing an as yet unpublished  novel, ''The Wild Seedling.''         Mrs. Irwin, whose husband, Keith, died in 1994, is survived by two other daughters, Jane Croll of Des Moines, and Ann Bauer of Dubuque; a son, Rees, of Ames, and four grandchildren.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman during political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died today at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon Baines Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been a classmate in Huron.         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Griffith Joyner, the three-time gold medalist at the 1988 Summer Olympics who revolutionized women's sprinting with her searing speed and flamboyant fashion sense, died yesterday at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif. She was 38.         Greg Foster, a former champion hurdler and a family friend, said he had spoken with Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, and with her sister-in-law, the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and had been told that Griffith Joyner was believed to have suffered a heart seizure.         An autopsy was performed yesterday afternoon, but the results were not immediately reported.         Lieut. Hector Rivera, a spokesman for the Orange County sheriff's department, said a 911 call was received yesterday at 6:30 A.M., Pacific time, from Griffith Joyner's husband indicating that she was unresponsive and not breathing. No evidence of foul play was discovered or was expected, Lieutenant Rivera said.         Foster, who is an executive in the marketing firm in St. Louis owned by Joyner-Kersee and who has extensive contact with the family, said he had been told that ''she never woke up this morning.''         Griffith Joyner had suffered a seizure two years ago during a flight and was hospitalized briefly. The family said little about that incident. Bob Kersee, who was Griffith Joyner's coach and who is married to Jackie Joyner-Kersee, said yesterday that there had been no diagnosis of the 1996 incident. As far as he knew, Foster said, ''She was doing fine.''         A decade after her shattering achievements in track and field, Griffith Joyner's sprint records still stand, and many feel they will carry into the next century.         Known by the abbreviation ''FloJo'' -- even her name was fast -- she set the world record for 100 meters at 10.49 seconds at the 1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis, then established the mark of 21.34 seconds in winning the 200 meters at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, where Griffith Joyner also won gold in the 100 meters and the 4x100-meter relay. She also took a silver medal in the 4x400-meter relay.         Not only did Griffith Joyner run considerably faster than any woman before her or since, she displayed a spectacular flashiness in the way she ran, dressing in one-legged spandex bodysuits and wearing six-inch-long, elaborately decorated fingernails. After retiring in 1989, she designed the uniforms of the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association. And she also served as co-chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.         ''We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent and captivated by her style,'' President Clinton said yesterday, praising Griffith Joyner's work with disadvantaged children.         Only now are Griffith Joyner's records even being approached. Marion Jones of the United States ran the 100 in 10.65 seconds this month, and the 200 in 21.62. But even with her present dominance, Jones is still tenths of a second away from Griffith Joyner's records in a sport in which personal bests are usually lowered by hundredths of a second at a time.         ''I think she established herself in sport like Babe Ruth,'' said Terry Crawford, who coached the American women's track and field team at the 1988 Summer Games.         To some, however, Griffith Joyner has come more to symbolize Roger Maris than Babe Ruth, and her accomplishments carry both literal and figurative asterisks. Some have questioned the validity of her 100-meter record because of a possibly faulty wind gauge, and others have questioned whether the stunning times she ran were facilitated by performance-enhancing drugs, something she always denied. She never failed a drug test.         She set the world record in the 100 meters on July 16, 1988, on a day of swirling wind in Indianapolis. The mark of 10.49 seconds was astonishing; it broke Evelyn Ashford's 1984 record by 27-hundredths of a second. In the era of electronic timing, the women's 100-meter record had never been lowered by more than 13-hundredths of a second.         That the wind gauge on the track read 0.0, meaning there was no tail wind or head wind, struck many as illogical, considering that the wind gauge on the nearby triple jump runway showed a reading well above the allowable aiding wind of 4.47 miles an hour. The statistics manual used by track and field's world governing body now includes an asterisk by Griffith Joyner's time and the remarks, ''probably strongly wind assisted.''         Some in Europe have called for a review of the record, but Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, said the matter was closed. He called Griffith Joyner a ''ground breaker'' who set standards of speed and flair ''that track and field is still trying to catch up to.'' Crawford, the 1988 Olympic track coach, said: ''There was no wind; I was right there. The track was brand new. It was hot and humid, ideal conditions.''         Because of the significant lowering of her sprint times and her increased musculature in 1988, Griffith Joyner was subjected to rumors and accusations about the possible use of such performance-enhancing drugs as anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.         The most serious allegation was made in 1989 by Darrell Robinson, a former national 400-meter champion, who said that he had sold human growth hormone to Griffith Joyner in 1988. She vehemently denied the charge, calling Robinson a ''compulsive, crazy, lying lunatic.''         ''I have never taken any drugs,''  Griffith Joyner said at the time. ''I don't believe in them. It's a false accusation.''         Yet, it was one that continued to have Griffith Joyner's achievements judged with some ambivalence by her rivals, including Ashford, the former world record-holder at 100 meters who finished second to Griffith Joyner in the 1988 Summer Olympics.         While praising Griffith Joyner's speed and flair, Ashford said yesterday, ''I think, for Florence, the drug issue will always come up, whether she did it or not.''         Griffith Joyner attributed her improved times to weight training, distance running and increased determination after her 1987 marriage to Al Joyner, who had won the triple jump at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She was not a one-year wonder, having won a silver medal at 200 meters at the 1984 Summer Games. ''I never had any doubt as to the credibility of her records,''  Crawford said.         Delorez Florence Griffith was born Dec. 21, 1959, in the Watts section of Los Angeles, the seventh of 11 children. Her father was an electrical technician and her mother was a teacher.         Always a fashion maverick, she was once asked to leave a shopping mall for wearing her pet boa constrictor around her neck like a feather boa.         According to David Wallechinsky's ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' Griffith Joyner began racing as a 7-year-old, but stopped temporarily in 1979, when she withdrew from California State-Northridge to help support her family. Working as a bank teller, she was later persuaded by Coach Bob Kersee to attend U.C.L.A., from which she received a degree in psychology in 1983 and emerging acclaim as a sprinter. Griffith Joyner went into semiretirement after winning an Olympic silver medal in 1984, working in a bank and as a beautician, but she lost weight and returned to serious training in 1987, preparing for her stunning performances a year later.         In addition to her husband, her survivors include their 7-year-old daughter, Mary.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman in the political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died on Sunday at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon B. Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election while the war in Vietnam raged.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness -- she once said she was afraid to address her own women's club -- she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife. I didn't even know how I'd be a mother. I would have been horrified to have thought of this.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         The Humphreys met in the early 1930's when Muriel was a student at Huron College. They married in 1936, and Mrs. Humphrey worked as a bookkeeper at a utility company to put her husband through college.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been one of her classmates when she graduated from high school in 1930. At the time, in 1981, Mr. Brown's sister, Dona, said, ''They never dated, but the families kept up with one another.''         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Francelia Butler, a late-blooming academic of such passionate, unorthodox ways that she has been credited with almost single-handedly transforming the study of children's literature from a stepchild of library science into a recognized academic discipline, died last Friday at a nursing home in Windham, Conn. A resident of Mansfield Hollow, Conn., she was 85 and had been a professor at the University of Connecticut.         When they hired her in 1965, it's a safe bet that the men who ran the English department at the University of Connecticut knew that Dr. Butler, a native of Cleveland who grew up in Elyria, Ohio, was a 52-year-old widow who had returned to school after her husband's death, received a doctorate in Renaissance literature from the University of Virginia just two years earlier and spent the intervening years teaching at the University of Tennessee.         It's an even safer bet that her Connecticut superiors did not know that in 1934, as a fresh Oberlin College graduate with a degree in the classics, Dr. Butler had gone to Washington to write a pamphlet for  an education association on ''The Brotherhood of Man.'' And that she had been swiftly dismissed from the project after overriding her boss's directive to go easy on Hitler lest she offend association members who agreed with Hitler's policies.         Or that she had been dismissed from her next job, as publicity director of a segregated Washington hotel, after letting black Oberlin alumni attend a banquet there.         Had they been aware of her record of ad hoc social activism, her superiors might have had second thoughts about relegating Dr. Butler, a small woman with a will of steel, to children's literature, a course so scorned by the Connecticut English faculty that it was known derisively as ''kiddie lit.'' Certainly her superiors would not have been as surprised as they were when Dr. Butler, sensing that the academic disdain for children's literature reflected a disdain both for children and for women as children's traditional caretakers and teachers, proceeded to turn the course into a platform for reform.         The faculty's sneers at her course were understandable. Although children's literature had been taught in American universities since the turn of the century, generally as part of the library science or education curriculums, it was a reflection of the subject's lowly standing that it had no academic association and no academic journal.         Dr. Butler swiftly made up for lost time. Among other things, she established the journal Children's Literature, helped to create the children's literature division of the Modern Language Association and served as a founding director of the Children's Literature Association in 1972.         Along the way Dr. Butler's own course became one of the largest and most popular at the University of Connecticut, in part because she turned it into something resembling a three-ring circus with a string of guest lecturers that included falconers, puppeteers, troubadours, Maurice Sendak, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno Bettelheim, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Big Bird and the Wicked Witch of the West (the actress Margaret Hamilton).         Some of her colleagues predictably complained that the course's success was based more on showmanship than scholarship, but Dr. Butler, many of whose students went on to to teach children's literature at other colleges, was no slacker as a scholar. She turned out reams of  papers, edited anthologies and in 1989 published ''Skipping Around the World,'' a study of international  jump-rope rhymes.         For all the acclaim she won, Dr. Butler chafed at what she saw as Connecticut's indifference or active opposition to her efforts to wrest children's literature from its vocational moorings and place it within the humanities.         When, by her account, her upstart Journal was actually banned from the University of Connecticut bookstore, Dr. Butler found another academic sponsor: Yale University. (Later, when Connecticut seemed to shun the annual Peace Games Festival she established to teach children conflict resolution through games that rewarded cooperation over competition, she moved it to Harvard.)         Although her male colleagues suggested that the university had been more supportive than she claimed, after her retirement in 1992 at the age of 79, Dr. Butler, who typically had led the campaign that overturned Connecticut's mandatory retirement at 70, transferred her journal and her papers to Hollins College in Virginia.         She is survived by her daughter, Ann Wandell of Windham; a brother, Bruce McWilliams of Little Deer Isle, Me; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Dr. Helen Winthrop Edey, a philanthropist and psychiatrist who was active in the field of women's reproductive health and rights, died on Sept. 15 at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 86 and lived on Martha's Vineyard and in Manhattan.         Dr. Edey was the former Helen W. Kellogg, a daughter of Morris W. Kellogg, an industrialist who founded the Kellogg Company, a New Jersey-based manufacturer of oil industry equipment. The beneficiaries of her philanthropy included organizations trying to control population growth and to give women the right to choose the number of children they have. She also supported environmental causes and nuclear arms control.         She was a former chairman and a longtime treasurer of the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, which has become AVSC International. (The term surgical contraception refers to methods of sterilization like vasectomy for men and tubal ligation for women.) The association is based in New York and works in the United States and more than 40 other countries to provide training and other support to health care professionals in the fields of family planning and reproductive health.         Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, said, ''Dr. Edey became a psychiatrist after her four children were born and had a remarkable professional career, both as a psychiatrist and as an individual who was very much concerned about women's reproductive health and rights.''         Dr. Edey did much fund-raising on behalf of AVSC International. Working through the association and on her own, she also played a role in persuading a growing number of health care institutions in the United States to provide voluntary surgical contraception.         Dr. Edey was long active in, and on the boards of, the Scherman Foundation, which works in various fields; the Edey Foundation, set up by her husband, Maitland A. Edey, an editor at Time Inc. and an author, which supports conservation activities on Martha's Vineyard, and the Martha's Vineyard Community Foundation.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from Brearley School in Manhattan and in 1933 from Vassar. She received her medical degree in 1951 from New York University, graduated in 1962 from the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan and practiced psychiatry and psychoanalysis from 1957 to 1970 in Manhattan.         Mr. Edey, the co-author of the book ''Lucy: The Beginnings of Mankind'' (1981), which won a National Book Award, died in 1992. Dr. Edey is survived by two sons, Maitland A. Jr. of Martha's Vineyard and Winthrop of Manhattan; two daughters, Beatrice Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.; 13 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.       
         Toni House, an author and a longtime Washington journalist who spent the last 16 years as the Supreme Court's public information officer, died here today of lung cancer, the Court announced. She was 55.         A former president of the Washington Press Club and officer of other press organizations, Ms. House was a Washington institution even before Chief Justice Warren E. Burger hired her for the anomalous position of press officer for an institution that often appeared to have an aversion to press coverage.         As a reporter and editor for The Washington Star for 15 years, Ms. House had won visibility and success covering the District of Columbia Police Department and local courts, one of the few women at the time to work that beat. With a co-author, Chuck Conconi, she wrote ''The Washington Sting,'' a book about an undercover police fencing operation she had covered in the early 1970's. She was deputy picture editor of The Star when the newspaper ceased publication in 1981.         As the Supreme Court's public information officer, Ms. House was the Court's public voice, although not, as she often stressed, its interpreter. ''From the city that brought you the word 'spinmeister,' I am not one,'' she told the Atlanta Lawyers Club in a speech several years ago, adding, ''I mean, if you don't like a Supreme Court decision, who are you going to appeal to?''         For the last several years, she served on the board of the American Judicature Society, a public interest group that strives to increase public understanding of legal issues.         Antoinette Aiello House -- she used the name Toni all her life -- was born on Jan. 5, 1943, in Washington, where her father was a doctor. She graduated from American University here and lived in Arlington, Va., with her husband, William J. Weller, whom she married in 1990. Besides Mr. Weller, she is survived by a daughter from an earlier marriage, Valerie Reuther of Seattle, and a brother, Dr. Homer House of Sherwood, Md.       
         Berenice Lipson-Gruzen, a pianist with a long international career, died on Sept. 3 in Bad Wiessee, Germany. She was 73 and lived in New York.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lipson-Gruzen won notice with her visit to China in 1981, recording the Chopin Second Piano Concerto with the Beijing Central Philharmonic. In New York, she performed at Alice Tully Hall, the 92d Street Y, Merkin Concert Hall and Weill Recital Hall. She taught at Cooper Union, the New School for Social Research, New York University and the City College of New York and gave private lessons.         Ms. Lipson-Gruzen was born in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She studied music, anthropology and psychology at Hunter College and made her piano debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1976.         She is survived by her son, Dimitri DeHarak of Montpelier, Vt., and her companion, James Keeler, who produced her recordings.       
         Toots Barger, a perennial world champion in a decidedly regional sport, died on Monday at a retirement home in Frederick, Md. She was 85 and had long been known as the Queen of Duckpins.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         If duckpins doesn't ring a bell, chances are you didn't grow up in or around Baltimore, where the squat-pin version of the familiar 10-pin bowling game was invented and became something of a municipal mania.         During the years Mrs. Barger was virtually invincible, from the mid- 1940's to the mid-1960's, the sport was so popular in Baltimore that the prestigious annual tournament sponsored by The Baltimore Evening Sun was regularly broadcast on local television, and Mrs. Barger, who won the tournament 12 times in 22 years, became such an acclaimed figure that she was regarded as the city's premiere athlete until Johnny Unitas came to town.         If the former Mary Elizabeth Ryan's record of 13 world duckpin championships and 9 world scoring records doesn't sound impressive, it's a safe bet you haven't stood at the head of a regulation, 60-foot bowling lane and tried to knock down 10 undersized (9-inch tall) pins placed at the usual 12 inches spacing with a 3-pound ball just 5 inches in diameter.         If you had, you would not be surprised that in her reign in duckpins, which has the same 10-frame scoring system as regular bowling and the same theoretic perfect score of 300, Mrs. Barger dominated the sport's women's division for the better part of two decades without ever once reaching 200.         But then one of duckpins' chief appeals has been that scoring is so difficult that while there have been myriad perfect games in regular bowling, no one has ever rolled a perfect game in tournament duckpins, whose highest recorded score is 279. (Mrs. Barger's best game was 198.)         No wonder. In contrast to the 8.5-inch bowling ball, the duckpin ball is small enough to roll between any two pins with plenty of room to spare. As a result, even though duckpins has been called a game of spares in contrast to bowling as a game of strikes, a spare (knocking down all 10 pins in two rolls) is so difficult that a third ball is allowed when a spare has not been scored.         Because the lightweight duckpin ball, which has no finger holes, is small enough for a child to handle, duckpins has long been cherished as a family sport in Baltimore.         Even so, Mrs. Barger, a Baltimore native who was given her nickname by an aunt, seems not to have played the sport as a child, perhaps because she was born only 13 years after duckpins' storied beginning.         According to Baltimore legend, it was invented in 1900 in an upstairs bowling alley at a tavern owned by two of Baltimore's premier sports heroes, the baseball figures John J. McGraw and Wilbert Robinson.         The game got its name, so the story goes, because the squat, cut-down pins reminded the duckshooting owners of ducks.         Mrs. Barger, whose husband, Ernest, was a plumber who later operated a bowling alley managed by his wife, was the mother of two children when she joined a housewife's duckpin league in the late 1930's and discovered that she had a rare talent for a difficult game.         Primarily because she played with dead solid oak balls in the days before the lively plastic pin era, Mrs. Barger's records have long since been eclipsed, and the sport itself, which once proliferated along the Atlantic coast from New Hampshire to North Carolina and as far inland as Indiana, has been in serious decline, even in Baltimore.         Even so, Mrs. Barger continued playing until three years ago and remained such a well-known figure that in 1992 she achieved renewed prominence leading a campaign to have duckpins named the Maryland state sport.         The campaign failed, perhaps because legislators felt duckpins was just too odd to be the state sport, especially when Maryland already had an official sport: jousting.         Mrs. Barger is survived by a son, Ernest Jr., of La Jolla. Calif.; a daughter, Mary Jane Joyce of Derwood, Md., four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         Joan Hickson, a stage, screen and television actress who became an international celebrity when she played Miss Marple, Agatha Christie's sharp-witted elderly detective, in a BBC television series from 1984 to 1992, died over the weekend at a hospital in Colchester, Essex, said her son, Nicholas Butler. She was 92.         Though Miss Hickson acted in more than 80 movies and had a considerable stage career, it was as Miss Marple, a role she took on in her late 70's, that she achieved her most success and her greatest renown. On ''Mystery!,'' she played the part just as Christie had written it: as a seemingly fluffy and disorganized spinster whose vast understanding of human nature and formidable, cleareyed intelligence helped her solve the mysteries that visited her village with uncanny regularity.         Miss Hickson took to her late television career with relish, saying she thought that Miss Marple was a ''splendid'' person because there was ''nothing you could say or do that would shock her.'' Among her legions of fans, drawn from the more than 30 countries in which the series appeared, was Queen Elizabeth, who awarded Miss Hickson the Order of the British Empire in 1987.         Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, in 1906, Joan Hickson began acting as soon as she could despite disapproval from her relatives. ''My Aunt Aggie -- she was about four feet tall -- drew herself up to her full height and said, 'What is Joan's destination to be?,' which she thought was the gutter, you see,'' she once recalled in an interview. Her first appearance, in 1927, was in a provincial theater company as an aristocrat.         Later, she appeared often in West End comedies, often taking on the role of a slightly batty aunt or a befuddled middle-aged woman, characters with names like Mrs. Pottle, Gladys Rumbelow and Mrs. Mould. During World War II, when London was prone to sudden bombing, she appeared in the Open Air Theater in Regent's Park.         ''We kept one eye on the sky to see what was coming over,'' she recalled. ''We used to feel the audience were being damned stupid because they sort of hurled themselves on the ground.''         After a long stage career, which included appearances in Henry James's ''The Tragic Muse'' and Ian Hay's ''The Gusher,'' she began to appear more and more often in movies, including ''The Guinea Pig'' (1948), ''The Card'' (1952) and ''The  39 Steps'' (1959).         Speaking of the scores of films she made, she once said: ''I watch these old films in black and white, and suddenly the door opens and there I am. The other day I was wearing the most awful hat.''         She returned often to the stage. Later in her career, she appeared in three of Peter Nichols's plays: ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg'' (1967), ''The Freeway'' and ''Forget-Me-Not Lane'' (1967). She also played Mrs. Bradman in the National Theater Company's production of Sir Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' (1976) and won a Tony Award as best supporting actress for her performance as Delia in Alan Ayckbourn's ''Bedroom Farce'' (1977).         Before she became television's definitive Miss Marple (''there were 30 others in the queue for auditions,'' she said), she appeared in the slender role of Miss Pryce in a 1946 West End production of Christie's ''Appointment With Death.'' Christie  happened to sit in the audience one night, and sent Miss Hickson a prophetic note afterward that read, ''I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple.''         ''Retirement is fatal,'' Miss Hickson once said, and she continued working long after the Miss Marple series ended, recording audio books of Christie mysteries. Her husband, Eric Butler, a family doctor, died in 1967. She is survived by a son and a daughter.       
         Megs Jenkins, a British stage, film and television actress who specialized in playing kindly, matronly characters, died on Oct. 5, said a spokeswoman for the Gordon Rodwell Funeral Service in Felixstow, Suffolk, where her funeral was held. She was 81.         Miss Jenkins played many parts in her long career, but she was best known for her portrayal of nurses, governesses, maids, cooks, long-suffering wives and wise mothers. With her unglamorous looks and her plump, open face, she seemed made for sympathy and found herself typecast in supporting, or supportive, roles.         Born Muguette Mary Jenkins in Birkenhead, Cheshire, in 1917, Miss Jenkins harbored dreams of becoming a ballet dancer but turned to acting, and dispensed with her exotic first name, she said, when she realized that she did not have a dancer's physique.         ''It was sad, really,'' she once said. ''I was this same unsylphlike shape when I was 17. I had fancied I might call myself by my real name, Muguette, once I became a ballerina. But I had to face the fact that I was quite definitely a Megs.''         After studying at the School of Dancing and Dramatic Art in Liverpool, she took her first professional role, as a German hausfrau in ''The Lift That Failed,'' in a production by the Liverpool Repertory Company in 1933. She remained with the company for four years, then moved to London.         She had a long and distinguished stage career, veering several times from the roles in which she was typecast: she played a cruel, mentally unstable mother in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' (1951), for instance, and the title role in Pinero's ''School Mistress'' (1954).         She was particularly praised for her role as a show-business fan in Emlyn Williams's ''Light of Heart'' (1940) and for her portrayal of the mother of a possible second messiah in a Welsh farming community during the Crimean War in another Emlyn Williams play, ''The Wind of Heaven'' (1945).         In 1956, she won the Clarence Derwent Award, then Britain's highest stage prize, for best supporting performance in Arthur Miller's ''View from the Bridge,'' in which she played a wife trying desperately to ignore her husband's incestuous feelings for his niece.         During World War II, she appeared in a number of patriotic movies intended to boost morale and support the war effort, including ''Millions Like Us'' (1943), about wartime factory workers, and ''The Lamp Still Burns,'' in which she played, not for the first or last time, a nurse.         She appeared in dozens of films, including ''The Brothers'' (1947), a strange melodrama set on the Isle of Skye; ''The Innocents'' (1961), a film based on Henry James's novella ''The Turn of the Screw,'' in which she played the nervous housemaid, and ''Indiscreet'' (1958), playing Ingrid Bergman's housekeeper.         Perhaps her most successful film was ''The History of Mr. Polly'' (1949), an adaption of H. G. Wells's comic novel, in which she seemed perfectly cast as a homey, dependable landlady.         Her television work included a role in the popular series ''All Creatures Great and Small,'' based on the James Herriot books, and a part in the comedy series ''Young at Heart,'' in which she played a bickering retiree opposite John Mills, who had been her co-star in ''The History of Mr. Polly.''         Miss Jenkins's 1943 marriage to George Routledge, a commando who had been a childhood classmate, and who renewed their acquaintance when he saw her name in a review, ended in divorce in 1959.       
         Deidre S. Murphy, assistant managing editor for news at The Star-Ledger of Newark, died on Thursday at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken. She was 47.         Ms. Murphy was hospitalized after suffering a stroke on Wednesday night as she walked near her home in Hoboken, said Scott Ladd, metropolitan editor of The Star-Ledger.         Ms. Murphy, known as Dee, went to New York in 1988 to be an assistant city editor and was later deputy metro editor at New York Newsday, where she helped supervise the paper's coverage of a subway crash that killed five people, caused by a motorman who was drunk. The coverage won the Pulitzer Prize for spot news in 1992. She also helped lead a team of the paper's reporters who  covered the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.         In 1995, after New York Newsday was closed, she went to work at The Star-Ledger, overseeing the paper's news-gathering operation. She left briefly to be metropolitan editor at The Daily News in 1997, then returned to The Star-Ledger.         Ms. Murphy was born in Springfield, Ill. Her first newspaper job was as a reporter for her hometown paper, The State Journal-Register, and she later worked as a reporter and city editor at The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester.         She is survived by her companion, Theadora Martens, and her mother, Helen Murphy of Springfield.       
         Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows, first ''Maude'' and then ''Good Times,'' died at a hospital here on Tuesday. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         Larry Calhoun, her longtime publicist, said the cause of death had not been determined, but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis. He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago, and that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to support a local black theater, something she had done most of her career.         Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of the two television shows just last week in a gathering here for a People magazine article.         Norman Lear, one of the executive producers of both of her shows, said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant, and that she had a role in a forthcoming movie, ''Down in the Delta,'' directed by the poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month.         Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed maid on television, and in that role she also performed memorably in the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie ''Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy award in 1979, and in the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in the film ''Rosewood.''         But she spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the cast of ''Good Times'' for a while, saying at the time that she resented the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show. In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in Chicago.         Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both on and off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. Mr. Lear, who was the executive producer of ''All in the Family,'' from which ''Maude'' and ''Good Times'' were later spun off, said one of his most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude.         Mr. Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the show, and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ''Me and My Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene, but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Mr. Lear described as ''an indelible memory of an indelible woman.''         Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character of the deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children and her father was a farmer.         She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New York. She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and in the late 1950's performed with Shologa Oloba, an African-American dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ''Zunguru.''         In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the N.A.A.C.P. Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks.         Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce and she had no children, her publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.       
         Edwige Feuillere, a much-loved French actress whose 60-year career took her from sensual screen beauty to grande dame of the Paris theater, died here on Nov. 13. She was 91 and lived in Paris. She was buried on Wednesday in a family tomb at Beaugency, near Orleans.         Ms. Feuillere first gained renown in 1935 when, shockingly for the time, she briefly appeared naked in Abel Gance's film ''Lucrece Borgia.'' And it was as a femme fatale that she achieved her greatest stage triumph, playing opposite Jean-Louis Barrault in Paul Claudel's ''Partage de Midi'' in 1947. But she was also frequently acclaimed for her interpretation of classical roles.         ''Edwige Feuillere was our Marlene Dietrich, our Irene Dunne and our Greta Garbo, all in one,'' Le Monde wrote after her death. She retired from the stage only six years ago after a final production in which she read from her best-known roles.         ''Now people can only see me as a very old person who had a mythical life,'' she said in a recent interview with a French writer. ''Ah, if only you had seen her when she was.'' She continued: ''Well, I'd like people to remember me for my best moment. But it could be when I was 25 or 50 or 70 or in my very last show.''         Her death, which prompted a wave of tributes from French political and cultural figures, came less than one week after that of Jean Marais, the handsome, swashbuckling French actor who played opposite Ms. Feuillere in Jean Cocteau's 1947 film ''L'Aigle a Deux Tetes.'' Cocteau had created the role for her, and she first created it onstage.         Stunningly beautiful in her youth, gracefully elegant in old age, Ms. Feuillere was remembered as much for her powerful well-modulated voice as for her expressive eyes and magnetic presence. Yet for all her popularity, she showed little interest in a glamorous life style. Modest and humorous in private, she was also self-deprecating about her talent in her 1977 autobiography, ''Les Feux de la Memoire.''         Ms. Feuillere was born Edwige Caroline Cunati on Oct. 29, 1907, in the town of Vesoul in eastern France. Her mother's family, originally from Alsace, had moved back to France after Germany occupied the region in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. Her father was Italian and, because he was drafted by the Italian army in World War I, Edwige spent much of her childhood in Italy.         After the war, the family moved to Dijon in France where she showed interest in the theater by acting in school plays. In 1928 she began attending the Paris Conservatory of Dramatic Arts, and two years later she married a fellow student, Pierre Feuillere, although the marriage soon floundered because of his drug problems.         Ms. Feuillere's career -- she first used the stage name of Cora Lynn before taking her husband's name -- began slowly with small parts in several mediocre films, although she is remembered for her lead role in the film version of Marcel Pagnol's play ''Topaze.'' She also found work in the theater and was invited to join the Comedie Francaise, but she left after two years, complaining that she was being overlooked for major roles.         In 1939, she was cast as Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas's play ''La Dame aux Camelias,'' and she at last won recognition as a serious stage actor. At the time, the play's director, Jacques Hebertot, predicted, ''You will carry this role throughout your life, a slave to the success it will bring you.'' And he was right: she appeared in frequent revivals -- in France and Britain -- for the next two decades.         During Germany's occupation of France in World War II, Ms. Feuillere worked in the theater (she helped discover Gerard Philipe in Jean Giraudoux's ''Sodome et Gomorrhe'') and in films (notably in Jacques de Baroncelli's 1941 ''Duchesse de Langeais''). After the war, she appeared in 200 performances of ''L'Aigle a Deux Tetes'' before taking on another major role, which she would also perform again and again, as Yse in ''Partage de Midi.'' When she appeared in the role in London in 1968, the British theater critic Harold Hobson described her as the greatest actress he had ever seen.         Although she played an old woman in Patrice Chereau's 1974 film ''La Chair de l'Orchide,'' she virtually abandoned the cinema after 1960.  But she remained a pillar of the French theater, occasionally appearing onstage with her old movie partner Jean Marais, seven years her junior. In 1965, she created the lead role in Giraudoux's ''Madwoman of Chaillot'' and returned to the play on several occasions.         Ms. Feuillere had no immediate survivors.         She first announced her retirement in 1984, but promptly changed her mind and appeared frequently onstage throughout the 1980's. Finally, on the eve of her 85th birthday, she did retire. ''I have died so many times onstage,'' she said recently. ''My own will arrive one day, probably sooner than I expect.''         Correction:  December 3, 1998, Thursday  A picture caption on Nov. 23 with an obituary of the French actress Edwige Feuillere misstated the original nationality of the actor and director Erich von Stroheim, shown with her in an unidentified film. He was born in Austria, not Germany.       
         Bobo Lewis, a screen and stage actress who performed with the Circle Repertory Company for 25 years, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 72 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her cousin, Susan Lera of Miami.         In a 1987 interview in The New York Times, Ms. Lewis, who was born in Miami, joked that as a newborn in the delivery room she had asked, ''Which way is New York?'' She moved to New York as a teen-ager and changed her given name, Barbara, because Actor's Equity had another actress by that name.         She took acting classes and eventually, in 1978, won a Drama Desk Award for her performance as the teacher in the original Broadway production of ''Working,'' which was adapted from Studs Terkel's book. Among her other Broadway credits were ''42d Street,'' ''Twigs,'' a revival of ''The Women,'' ''Lorelei,'' ''On the 20th Century'' and ''The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940'' in a role written for her by John Bishop. She toured nationally in Robert Patrick's ''Kennedy's Children,'' Neil Simon's ''God's Favorite'' and with Ben Bagley's revue, ''The Decline and Fall of the Entire World as Seen Through the Eyes of Cole Porter.''         As a member of Circle Repertory Company, she appeared in E. E. Cummings's ''Him'' with Lanford Wilson in the title role. Her favorite roles were in Milan Stitt's ''Runner Stumbles,'' opposite William Hurt, and Jim Leonard's ''Diviners,'' which toured Asia.         Last year she was nominated for a Joseph Jefferson Award for her performance as Stella in ''Light Up the Sky'' at Chicago's Goodman Theater. She played a variety of Shakespearean roles at resident theaters across the country, including the Rhode Island Shakespeare Festival, the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival and the Seattle Repertory.         Her film credits include ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''; ''Le Sauvage'' with Catherine Denueve and Yves Montand; ''The Paper,'' ''The Wild Party,'' ''Running on Empty,'' and most recently, ''One True Thing.'' She was a frequent guest on the television series ''That Girl'' and ''Bewitched,'' in which she played Agnes Moorehead's sister. Young viewers knew her as Midge Smoot on the PBS children's television show, ''Shining Time Station.''       
         Viola Farber, a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a choreographer and the director of the dance program at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Dec. 24 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 67 and lived in Bronxville.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, Jeff Slayton, her former husband and longtime dance partner, said.         A tall, long-bodied individualist with uncompromisingly cropped hair long before that was fashionable, Ms. Farber was an unself-conscious study in quiet unpredictability. She moved with a fierce passion and intensity and a gentle lyricism. She could speak with the softness of a shy, reflective child or, in the studio, with the toughness of a drill sergeant. An edge of lazily subversive wit lay beneath her plain-spokenness in conversation and in her dancing.         In the quintessentially Farberesque ''Legacy,'' which she choreographed in 1968 to a Chopin etude, Ms. Farber moved like a dreaming, elegant giraffe, dressed in a flowing shift but wearing a baseball catcher's mitt on one hand. Poetic and mysterious, the solo was not at all Dadaist despite the incongruity and potential humor of the mitt.         ''Her body often had the look of one part being in balance, and the rest extremely off,'' Mr. Cunningham wrote of her in David Vaughan's book ''Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,'' in a description of Ms. Farber in his 1960 ''Crises,'' created in part for her odd talents. ''Now and again it was like two persons, another just ahead or behind the first. This was coupled with an acute rhythmic sense.''         Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Ms. Farber came to the United States with her family at the age of 7 and became a naturalized citizen six years later. She met Mr. Cunningham and his collaborator John Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College, where she was studying dance with Katherine Litz and music with Lou Harrison. Ms. Farber joined the Cunningham company in 1953, dancing there through 1965. She created roles in some of Mr. Cunningham's major early works, among them ''Crises,'' ''Rune'' and ''Nocturne.''         During her Cunningham years, she also performed with Litz, playing a vampire in her ''Dracula,'' and with Peter Saul and Paul Taylor. Her last performance was in a 1995 collaborative duet, ''Threestep (Shipwreck),'' which she created with the choreographer Ralph Lemon, a former student, for his company's season at the Joyce Theater.         Ms. Farber formed the Viola Farber Dance Company in 1968, creating most of her choreography for the troupe, which disbanded in 1985. Writing in the International Encyclopedia of Dance, Christopher Caines describes her earliest dances as having a febrile atmosphere and ''a dark, violent intensity that some interpreted as sadomasochistic, despite moments of tenderness.'' By the 1970's, Ms. Farber had mellowed considerably. ''My dances report what I see,'' she told Jack Anderson in a 1978 interview in The New York Times. ''They are my response to the way everything is mixed up together in this world -- people and microbes and elephants and cassowary birds.''         In her 1973 ''Poor Eddie,'' Ms. Farber incorporated the gestures of flight attendants as they demonstrate the use of safety equipment in planes. Her own nervousness about driving in the middle, passing lane on a three-lane highway inspired the creation of another dance, ''Route 6.'' Like Mr. Cunningham, Ms. Farber favored the juxtaposition of disparate kinds of activity in dance, where formal patterns and the combinations of steps often mattered more than the steps themselves.         Ms. Farber was especially popular in France, where she won a gold medal, with Mr. Slayton, in the Ninth International Dance Festival in Paris in 1971. From 1981 to 1983 she was the artistic director of the Centre National de Danse Contemporaine in Angers, establishing, at the same time, an institute for the training of dance teachers in Paris. Ms. Farber returned to the United States in 1988 to take the Sarah Lawrence post, but continued to teach and choreograph in France into the 1990's. She also taught at the London Contemporary Dance School from 1984 to 1987 and, from early in her career, at universities and dance festivals throughout the United States.         The French Government recently named Ms. Farber an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France.         She is survived by two sisters, Elisabeth Lanzl of Chicago and Irene Aikin of Parkdale, Ore.         Correction:  January 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the dancer and choreographer Viola Farber on Dec. 31 misstated the work and the year in which she last performed. It was in James Cunningham's ''From the Horse's Mouth'' at the Joyce SoHo last April, not in ''Threestep (Shipwreck)'' in 1995.       
         Flora Roberts, a dynamic play agent who represented many important theater artists, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 77, and lived in Manhattan and Bridgewater, Conn.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her associate Sarah Douglas.         Stephen Sondheim, Tina Howe, Alfred Uhry, Maury Yeston and others were greatly indebted to Ms. Roberts, who encouraged them to challenge themselves. As she said in an interview earlier this year, ''writers are causes.'' When she believed in someone, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to nurturing the career of that client.         As Mr. Sondheim said, she was ''a protector and an idealist'' who cared more about the work than the contract. She was not known for her power as a negotiator but for her perspicacity in reading scripts and in analyzing a play in production. Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, said Ms. Roberts had ''a real ability to think like a producer, feel like an artist and act like an agent.''         A perfect personification of her first name, Ms. Roberts gave new meaning to the word flamboyant. She was, Ms. Howe said, ''a woman of enormous style, heart, experience, courage, intelligence -- a real original.'' As round as she was short, and fond of wearing large red hats, Ms. Roberts was one of the most colorful people in the American theater, bursting with energy and with a gravelly voice that approached that of a basso profundo. She was outspoken with her ideas and comments and thought nothing of castigating a client if she felt that a play was worthy of improvement.         Her greatest talent was in her instinctive reaction to fine work, no matter where it came from. As she said, ''Fortunately, I have a finger on the pulse.'' Years ago, Frank Loesser sent her a composer who had written a musical that he considered very noncommercial. She listened to the composer play one song on the piano in her apartment, and it gave her goose bumps. The song was ''Sit Down, John''; the musical was ''1776.'' She recommended that the composer, Sherman Edwards, work with Peter Stone (not her client) as a book writer. Then she guided the show to its Broadway success.         When she received a script of ''The Gin Game,'' she wondered who would want to do ''a two-character play about old people,'' then noticed a photograph on her wall of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ''The Four-Poster.'' She called Mr. Cronyn, and, buoyed by his enthusiasm, the play quickly rolled into production. The author, D. L. Coburn, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, one of many honors awarded to Ms. Roberts's clients, including Pulitzers for ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' Mr. Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' a play that she suggested Mr. Uhry write when he was thinking of doing a television mini-series.         She met Mr. Sondheim in the early 1950's when he was working on his first show, ''Saturday Night,'' and he became her longest-running client. From ''West Side Story'' onward, she made creative contributions to his musicals.         Last season, shows that Ms. Roberts represented filled theatrical marquees: Ms. Howe's ''Pride's Crossing,'' the revivals of ''Anne Frank'' and ''1776,'' and, carried over from the previous season, Mr. Uhry's ''Last Night of Ballyhoo'' and the musical ''Titanic.''         Ms. Roberts was born in the Bronx, and studied at the Manhattan School of Music and Hunter College to become an opera singer. At one point she sang for Arturo Toscanini. She remembered that he said, ''Molta musica, but a small voice.'' Eventually, she became something of a diva in real life, and switched from opera to torch songs, which she often sang for friends.         After graduation, she worked as an all-purpose assistant to Kermit Bloomgarden, the producer. One day in the mid-1940's Mr. Bloomgarden gave her a new play to read, Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' When the playwright asked what she thought of it, she offered  frank criticism. In response, Ms. Hellman told the producer to give his assistant a raise, adding, ''She's right, and I don't think I can fix it.''         ''I got a raise,'' said Ms. Roberts, ''and she tried to fix it.''         That same year, Arthur Miller submitted a play (later titled ''All My Sons'') to Mr. Bloomgarden and she advised him to produce it. Able to present only one play at a time, he chose Ms. Hellman's instead, but with Ms. Roberts's encouragement, subsequently produced ''Death of a Salesman.''         In the 1950's, because of her interest in playwrights, she became an agent. One of her first clients was Ira Levin, then a television writer. She got him an assignment adapting the Mac Hyman novel ''No Time for Sergeants,'' first for television, then for Broadway, and she discovered the play's star, Andy Griffith.         Although most of her clients were writers, Ms. Roberts also represented a few directors (Susan Stroman) and designers (Jennifer Tipton). Frequently she had solicitations to join major talent agencies, but she remained fiercely independent and placed great emphasis on personal loyalty. As she said: ''I really love most of my clients. That's a privilege when you're on your own.''         She is survived by her sister, Janet Sovin of Berkeley, Calif., and her brother, David, of Huntington Station, N.Y.         Ms. Roberts's major passions were theater and horses. She owned a racehorse, Allaway, and often visited Belmont Park. At the track or on Broadway, she relied upon her experience and her assessment of form and potential. Sometimes she just took a flier and followed her intuition, as when she bet on a horse named ''Comedy Tonight'' because Mr. Sondheim had written a song by that name. Naturally, she bet on the horse to show, and it did. About her other preoccupation, she said, ''I gamble on the theater every day.''
