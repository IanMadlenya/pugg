         Rita Valentine Tishman, a New York benefactor of Jewish and civic causes, died on Jan. 21 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91.         She was decorated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt for leading the New York State women's division of the War Bond drive in the 1940's. Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson cited her work in civil rights.         She was a founding chairman, with Dore Schary, of Friends of Democracy, which championed human rights after World War II. She inspired the Rita V. Tishman Award, given annually by the Anti-Defamation League, recipients of which have included Betty Ford and Mary Lindsay.         She was a past president of the community-based National Council of Jewish Women, which supports the Lighthouse, day centers for the elderly and Libraries on Wheels. She also was a volunteer for the American Jewish Committee, the United Jewish Appeal and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and was an honorary chairman of all three.         Mrs. Tishman graduated from Smith College. She was the widow of Norman Tishman, former president of the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, who died in 1967.         She is survived by a son, Peter V. Tishman of Manhattan; two daughters, Margot T. Linton and Valerie T. Diker, both of Manhattan, 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Rita V. Tishman, a New York benefactor of Jewish and civic causes, referred incorrectly to a Jewish women's organization she served as president, and to an organization it sponsored for the blind. She headed the National Council of Jewish Women New York Section, not its umbrella group, the National Council of Jewish Women Inc. The New York Section established the Jewish Guild for the Blind; the guild is not associated with the Lighthouse.       
         Virginia Foster Durr, a well-born civil rights campaigner who was on hand when Rosa Parks was bailed out of jail where she was being held for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white man in 1955, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Carlisle, Pa. She was 95.         Mrs. Durr and her husband, Clifford, a lawyer, were New Deal veterans who were in the thick of the civil rights movement in their native Alabama in the 1950's and 1960's.         President Clinton said, in a statement: ''A white woman, born to privilege in the Deep South, Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye to racism and intolerance in our society. Her courage and steely conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped to change this nation forever.''         In 1955 Mrs. Durr and her husband helped a black civil rights leader, E. D. Nixon, bail Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress active in the N.A.A.C.P., out of jail in Montgomery, Ala., said Dr. Patricia Sullivan, a historian and fellow at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute of Afro-American Research at Harvard University.         Mrs. Parks's action touched off the Montgomery bus boycott by blacks, which helped spur the civil rights movement and brought the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence.         Mrs. Parks said in a letter to the Durr family: ''I will miss you, old soldier, but the rich legacy you have passed to your children, grandchildren and great-grands lives on. We still have a long ways to go, but you, my friend, have made it easier for all of us.''         A native of Birmingham, Ala., Virginia Foster was reared there in the traditions of the Old South. She was a debutante, was prominent in the local Junior League and attended Wellesley College.         She moved to Washington in the 1930's, when Mr. Durr was on the staff of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In the Washington of the 1930's, many New Deal Young Turks clustered around the couple. Her personal liberalism found expression in those years, and she was a founding member of the interracial Southern Conference for Human Welfare, which opposed segregation.         Mrs. Durr also helped Eleanor Roosevelt generate support for legislation to end the poll tax, which helped prevent many Southerners from voting. In 1948 she was an unsuccessful candidate of Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party for the Senate from Virginia.         Three years later the Durrs moved to Montgomery, where they supported the bus boycott and other civil rights activities. In 1954 she was summoned before the Senate's Internal Security Subcommittee after being accused of harboring Communist sympathies. She testified that she did not belong to the Communist Party and had not attended any party meetings.         As Rosellen Brown, a novelist, has put it, ''While the majority of Alabamians considered Virginia and Clifford Durr traitors, not heroes, they represented to many of us the best of the white South, its native strength: they were sensible, outspoken, committed and only accidentally heroic.''         Mrs. Durr won applause for her autobiography, ''Outside the Magic Circle'' (University of Alabama, 1985)'' edited by Hollinger F. Barnard. Dr. Sullivan is also editing a  book of Mrs. Durr's letters.         The Durrs were married in 1926. Mr. Durr died in 1975.         Mrs. Durr is survived by four daughters, Ann Durr Lyon of Harrisburg, Pa., Lucy Durr Hackney of Philadelphia, Virginia Foster Durr of Sweden, Me., and Lulah Durr Colan of Milwaukee; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Vivian Hallinan, the striking matriarch of one of San Francisco's best-known and most colorful political families, died on Tuesday at a granddaughter's home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 88.         Mrs. Hallinan, the widow of Vincent Hallinan, a fiery socialist lawyer who died in 1995, made a multi-million-dollar fortune by buying apartment buildings during the Great Depression.         ''She didn't trust the stock market, so she didn't get wiped out, and had money to buy buildings real cheap,'' said Shane Hallinan, the granddaughter at whose home Mrs. Hallinan died.         Her profits financed her political causes, which included leftist movements like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. ''She was aware of the contradiction,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''But she believed she was able to do something to better the world with the money she made.''         A native San Franciscan, Mrs. Hallinan was born Oct. 21, 1910, to Ed Moore and Katherine Lagomarsino Moore. After her parents' brief marriage ended, she was reared by her mother, whose maiden name she adopted, and by a series of immigrant Italian relatives. She attended the University of California at Berkeley.         After her marriage in 1932 to Mr. Hallinan Mrs. Hallinan reared six sons. She wrote about the experience in ''My Wild Irish Rogues'' (Doubleday & Company, 1952).         Politics was her passion as much as parenting, however. She helped her husband with his campaign in 1952 as the Presidential candidate of the Progressive Party. She also held the family together when he spent six months in jail in the 1950's for contempt of court, in connection with his support of the labor organizer Harry Bridges, who was accused of being a Communist Party member.         Mrs. Hallinan, elegant and chestnut-haired, served 30 days for participating in the 1964 civil rights demonstrations in San Francisco. She was also tear-gassed once, in Chile in the early 1980's.         ''She found the experience in jail heartening,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''She was used to being judged by her movie-star looks or her money, and here she was with just all these other women. The other stuff didn't matter, and she liked that.''         With her during that civil rights demonstration were all of her sons, including Terence Hallinan, now the district attorney for San Francisco.  ''Everyone was there except my father, who stayed outside with the bail money,'' said Patrick Hallinan of Kentfield, Calif.         Besides Terence and Patrick, Mrs. Hallinan is survived by three other sons: Matthew, Daniel and Conn, all of Berkeley, and 16 grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Huckaby, who as a vice principal shepherded nine black students through the tumultuous integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, died on March 18 in Little Rock.         Mrs. Huckaby, whose memoir, ''Crisis at Central High,'' inspired a 1981 television movie recounting the landmark civil rights confrontation, was 93.         In September 1957, Mrs. Huckaby was about to enter her 28th year at Central High. A native of Hamburg, Ark., the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of the University of Arkansas, she was accustomed to the ways of the South. As she remembered it, ''I had never known any black well, except those in household employ.''         Soon, she would be trying to shield the first black students at Central High from intimidation by white students.         As an outgrowth of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, the Little Rock school board admitted nine blacks to Central High for the 1957-58 school year. But Gov. Orval E. Faubus called out the National Guard to prevent their entry. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock and placed the Arkansas guardsmen under Federal control to insure the black students' admission in the face of mob action.         On one occasion, 50 boys gathered atop the stairs at the school's entrance when no troops were in sight and shouted racial epithets at the blacks as they approached.         Melba Pattillo Beals, in her memoir, ''Warriors Don't Cry'' (Pocket Books, 1994), recalled what happened as she and other black students were about to retreat:         ''Vice Principal Huckaby made her presence known at the bottom of the stairs. Tiny, erect, and determined, she stood there all alone between us and our attackers, demanding they leave us alone. One by one she challenged the leaders, calling them by name, telling them to get to class or there would be hell to pay. Whether or not she favored integration, she had a heck of a lot of guts.''         The best-remembered image of the Little Rock events is a photograph showing a white girl, her face contorted in rage, screaming at Elizabeth Eckford, a black girl entering the school.         Mrs. Huckaby, the vice principal for girls and an English teacher, took the white student to her office.         ''I told her, hatred destroys the people who hate,'' Mrs. Huckaby recalled. ''She shrugged. Well, that was the way she felt, she said. Wasted breath.''         Mrs. Huckaby later persuaded Miss Eckford to remain in school after she came to her office in tears over continuing harassment.         The tensions took their toll on Mrs. Huckaby, who testified at a June 1958 court hearing: ''I would lie awake at night wondering what I could do. I had no social life at all because on weekends I was too tired. I would go out to the country and just sit.''         Eight of the nine black students remained through the school year, and at commencement ceremonies on May 27, 1958, Ernest Green became the first black graduate of Central High. Mrs. Huckaby stayed at the school until retiring in 1969. ''Crisis at Central High'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1980), based on journals she had kept during the confrontation, was made into a CBS movie that brought Joanne Woodward an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Mrs. Huckaby.         Mrs. Huckaby is survived by a sister, Clara Doyle, of Danville, Calif., and a brother, Clifton Paisley, of Tallahassee, Fla.         Mrs. Huckaby, who did not consider herself a social crusader, would recall having told Daisy Bates of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Arkansas that ''since my field was education, my immediate goal was having the black children in school as just ordinary children.''         She supported school integration, believing, she said, that ''no public school system segregated by law on the basis of race is consistent with democracy.''       
         Ida Klaus, a labor law pioneer who became a high-ranking New York City official in the 1950's and who wrote the law that gave city employees the right to bargain collectively, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Ms. Klaus was a lifelong labor advocate whose sympathy for the working classes was instilled in her by her mother. As a young child growing up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, she helped give free food from the family grocery to striking factory workers.         She organized her first union while still in her teens. She was one of three college women working as a waitress in the summer with several professional waiters at the Gross & Baum Hotel in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. One day, she heard that the hotel planned to lay off some of the waiters.         ''I don't know where I got the nerve, but I said, 'Let's get together and have a meeting,' '' she said in a 1974 interview in The New York Times.         Ms. Klaus became the spokeswoman for the waiters and waitresses, and told the hotel management that if anyone was discharged, they would all go.         ''At which point, Mr. Baum said he knew he shouldn't have hired college girls,'' she recalled. ''But he didn't fire anyone.''         Ms. Klaus's desire to become a lawyer also derived from the experience of watching her mother battle  the court system for 10 years over her husband's estate.         But after graduating from Hunter College and, in 1925, from the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, now the  Albert A. List College, she was denied admission to Columbia University Law School because she was a woman.         She taught Hebrew until 1928, when she was admitted to the law school with the first class to accept women. She received her law degree in 1931.         After graduation, Ms. Klaus worked as a review lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board in Washington. In 1948, she took the post of solicitor for the National Labor Relations Board, a position that made her the highest-ranking female lawyer in the Federal Government.         In 1954, she was hired as counsel to the New York City Department of Labor under Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She became known as the author of the so-called Little Wagner Act, the city version of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which recognized workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively through unions of their choosing. The Federal Wagner Act was named for the Mayor's father, Senator Robert F. Wagner.         She also wrote Mayor Wagner's executive order creating the first detailed code of labor relations for city employees.         ''She is one of the pioneers and champions of bringing law and order into labor relations,'' said Robert S. Rifkind, a lawyer and longtime friend whose father, Simon H. Rifkind, was a law clerk for Ms. Klaus. ''She believed labor relations ought not to be under the rule of tooth and claw.''         Ms. Klaus briefly worked in the Kennedy Administration in 1961 as a consultant for the first labor relations task force for Federal employees.         She returned to New York in 1962 as director of staff relations for the  Board of Education, where she negotiated what was reported to be the first citywide teachers' contract in the country.         She left in 1975 to become a private arbitrator. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her one of the three negotiators in the Long Island Rail Road strike.         Ms. Klaus, who was born on Jan. 8, 1905, received Columbia Law School's Medal for Excellence in 1996, and an honorary doctorate in 1994 from the Jewish Theological Seminary.         No close relatives survive.       
         Mae Bertha Carter, who defied gunfire and the loss of employment to send her children to previously all-white public schools in Mississippi, eventually winning a legal battle that confirmed their right to be there, died on April 28 at her home in Drew, Miss. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Francine E. Cheeks, a spokeswoman for the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia, a Quaker organization that supported Ms. Carter and many other black families in the civil rights struggle of the 1960's.         Ms. Carter was born on Jan. 13, 1923, in Sunflower County, Miss. She married Matthew Carter in 1939, and the couple became sharecroppers, raising 25 acres of cotton and sharing the income with the landowners, on Pemble Plantation, near Drew.         In the fall of 1965, just after the Carters had enrolled 7 of their 13 children in local white schools, the owner of the plantation told them to withdraw the children, saying they would receive a better education in a black school.         Ms. Carter's response was to take an old phonograph onto the porch and play a recording of a speech by President John F. Kennedy on civil rights.         ''I birthed those children and bore the pain,'' she later told her husband. Referring to the plantation owner, she said, ''He cannot tell me what to do about my children.''         Public schools throughout Mississippi were desegregated by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the state enacted what it called a freedom-of-choice law and used it to intimidate blacks into remaining at inferior black schools.         The Carters, however, resolutely kept their children in the once-segregated white schools, even though their house was once riddled with bullets in the middle of the night and they were eventually evicted, losing their income and their house.         From 1965 to 1968, the Carters were the only black family to keep their children in the county's schools.         In 1967 the Carters and Marian Wright Edelman, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., sued the Drew school district, challenging the state freedom-of-choice law. They won the suit in 1969, removing the last legal hurdle to the desegregation of Mississippi's public schools.         Eventually, eight of the Carter's children graduated from what had been all-white schools in Sunflower County; five older children graduated from local black schools. Eleven also graduated from college -- seven from the once-segregated University of Mississippi.         The story of the Carter family's battle was recounted in a book, ''Silver Rights'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1995) by Constance Curry, a field worker with the American Friends Service Committee in 1966, who worked closely with the family. The title is an old rural-black colloquial abridgment, noted by the novelist Alice Walker, of the phrase ''civil rights.''         Mrs. Carter's husband, Matthew, died in 1988. She is survived by five sons, Carl, of Columbus, Miss., Stanley, of Tulsa, Okla., Larry, of Hampton, Va., John, of Lake Charles, La., and Matthew Jr., of Conway, Ark.; eight daughters, Beverly Carter of Drew, Naomi Granberry of Cleveland, Miss., Pearl Owen and Deborah Smith, both of Oxford, Miss., Gloria Dickenson of Battle Creek, Mich., Ruth Whittle and Bertha Huckleby, both of Toledo, Ohio, and Edna Threats of Kansas City, Kan., 35 grandchildren and 36 great-grandchildren.       
         Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and politicians, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham. The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on March 15.         Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said yesterday, ''When it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''         In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the public perception of six Presidential administrations and scores of policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf war. In 1978, when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.         In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25 years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed the best of her work.         ''Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. ''She set the tone of debate early, before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water supply.''         Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan Administration.         A hands-on manager of both the editorial and op-ed pages of The Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will, Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Kraut hammer credit Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.         Her friends and confidants were legion, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as The Post's publisher.         ''Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement yesterday. ''She was both brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''         As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ''Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Mr. Will said. ''Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''         Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980's and 1990's, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues, from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.         She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of President Clinton's supporters toward Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.         ''Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy, retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the Constitution,'' she wrote. ''To be rude about it, as they were, they dismissed him as a bore.         ''But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or even to a degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman statesman, a man beyond reproach -- a living, walking, breathing toga.''         Mary Ellen Greenfield -- she derived Meg from her initials -- was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Seattle, where her father, Lewis Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature, then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in England, specializing in William Blake's works.         After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.         After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Mr. Nixon.         ''Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote. ''But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him until they have been pitted against something else -- an extreme danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack from some sinister quarter.''         Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in 1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The Washington Post. One of Mr. Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.         As Mr. Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a courtesy call on Mr. Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed cold warrior said to his dovish successor: ''My boy, you're making the mistake of your life. She's on my side.''         Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years that followed.         A year after she arrived at The Post, Mr. Geyelin made Miss Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a studied distance from it.         Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited an op-ed article from Mr. Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.         The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks. ''It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Mr. Wilkins said.         Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.         An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in the 1970's so she could read more classic works. She was also a perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University, Williams College and Princeton University.         When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her only remaining relatives.         In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ''More Mush From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the street, it was replaced with the headline ''All Must Share the Burden.''         ''That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ''All Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ''Just put us in the presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the biggest losers of all will be -- are you ready? -- well, of course, the nation's children.''         She added: ''When the end of the world finally comes about and editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No, it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so nicely under the headline ''All Must Share the Burden'' for which we will, collectively, fry.''       
         Rose Kryzak, an outspoken lobbyist for the rights of the elderly who was once credited with getting a utility charge overturned as unfair to older people, died on Thursday at her home in Queens. She was 99.         She first came to the public's attention in 1976, when she argued at a Federal Power Commission hearing in Washington that utility companies should not be allowed to pass along to customers -- many of whom were elderly people with restricted incomes -- the cost of plants that were still under construction and not producing power.         Mrs. Kryzak, then 75, bluntly challenged the lawyers and bankers who represented the utilities. ''We cannot afford plants that most of us would not live to enjoy,'' she said.         The commission decided not to allow such charges except in hardship cases, and The New York Times attributed the decision to the ''Kryzak problem.''         Mrs. Kryzak's victory was not final. In 1987, after the name of the agency had been changed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the utilities won the right to request rate increases that would cover up to 50 percent of the costs of plants under construction.         Mrs. Kryzak also helped organize groups of the elderly throughout New York State to lobby for a state-financed pharmaceutical plan to assist in paying for prescription drugs, worked to eliminate mandatory retirement laws and was vocal on increasing state supplements for Social Security.         Mrs. Kryzak, a member of the American Communist Party throughout her life, was one of the principal subjects interviewed for the documentary ''Seeing Red,'' shown at the New York Film Festival in 1983.         ''She held to her belief throughout her life,'' her son, Thomas, said. ''She refused to accept that there was any problem with the Soviet Union. Partly, it was patriotism for the old country. Both she and my father, who died in 1985, were born in Russia before the Revolution.         ''They considered themselves pioneers,'' he said, ''going down the road that this country should go down.''         Mrs. Kryzak, who was born on Oct. 15, 1899, was the oldest of six children. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1910. Her father, Isaac Marron, was an early member of the House Painters Union and a Socialist.         Mrs. Kryzak worked her entire adult life for an actuary until retiring in 1972.         In addition to her son, Thomas, of Fresh Meadows, Queens, she is survived by a daughter, Ann Herman of Lakeland, Fla., five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.       
         Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where she lived. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a spokesman with the United States Embassy in Santiago.         Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said,  ''Anyone who was involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially taking the lead, was courageous.''         In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting of those who vanished under General Pinochet and prosecution of those involved in their deaths.         In the past year, she led protests in London in support of General Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83, is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years in power, from 1973 to 1990.         ''The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family. She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in 1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later, mother of three children.         In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American Government, General Pinochet overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Mr. Pizarro, a Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret police run by the Chilean armed forces.         More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under General Pinochet are still unaccounted for.         Two days after Mr. Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed her the time to search for her husband and work with the Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son, Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and sisters.         Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Pizarro hanging around her neck.         Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from prosecution .         Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.         Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of General Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization called ''They Dance Alone.''         The current democratic Government in Chile issued a statement mourning Ms. Sierra's death.         Secretary General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the Government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must have felt. ''Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without knowing the truth,'' Mr. Mladinic said. 'I hope that in the near future this pain will end.''       
         Brenda Hughes Moore, a human-rights advocate and arts consultant and the wife of the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, died Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 56 and lived in Greenwich Village and Stonington, Conn.         The cause was hepatitis, her husband said.         A native of Richmond, Mrs. Moore graduated from Salem College in North Carolina and studied at the University of Aix-Marseille and the University of Perugia.         She accompanied her first husband, John Franklin Campbell, a Foreign Service officer, to Ethiopia, where she became a special assistant to Emperor Haile Selassie and arranged a national exposition of Ethiopian crafts. She was also interested in the cause of Eritrea, then seeking independence from Ethiopia. Back in the United States, she assisted her husband, the first editor of Foreign Policy and author of ''The Foreign Affairs Fudge Factory.''         Mr. Campbell died in 1971 at age 31, and the next year she married Vernon Eagle, then the executive director of the New World Foundation, which supported civil rights and community projects.         The year after Mr. Eagle's death in 1974, she married Bishop Moore, who had officiated at her second wedding and had himself recently been widowed. She later received a degree from Yeshiva University as an arts appraiser.         In 1989 she and Bishop Moore visited the island of East Timor, and for the rest of her life she championed the cause of autonomy for East Timor.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Moore's immediate survivors are two sisters, Stephanie Hughes of Phoenix, and Lisa Hughes of Honolulu.       
         Celestine Sibley, an Atlanta newspaper columnist who for 55 years wrote about the commonplaces of Southern life in a prose as soothing as the hum of cicadas in summer, died on Sunday at her vacation home on Dog Island, Fla.         Ms. Sibley was 85, and her last column was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 25.         In it, she writes of her own invalid's insomnia, when her thoughts turn to Key lime pie (''you stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has a tendency to slither'') and quilts (''when they are old and faded and weightless, you pull them up and remember the women who made them and the families they 'kivvered' with them'').         There were few regional columnists who could match Ms. Sibley for longevity, although the columnist Herb Caen of The San Francisco Chronicle did stretch his career over 58 years before his death in 1997.         But unlike other proud regional voices -- Mike Royko in Chicago or Atlanta's own Ralph McGill -- Ms. Sibley was not forceful as she passed on her musings about minutiae: choosing a Christmas tree, baking a pie, daydreaming about a Civil War battle and forgetting to pay a toll in the process. Echoes of the novelist Margaret Mitchell's ability to describe and evoke nostalgia run throughout Ms. Sibley's work.         ''It was a country-girl-come-to-the-city kind of column,'' said Bill Kovach, a former editor of The Journal-Constitution, who is curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. ''She was the last voice of the white-glove, tea-and-apple-blossom set that had not a sharp edge on it.''         Ms. Sibley was born near Pensacola, Fla., and joined The Atlanta Constitution as a reporter in 1941, covering murder trials and Georgia Statehouse politics. She was assigned her first column in 1944 when she had to take time away from the office to be with her children.         ''For generations and generations of Georgians, she embodied the South, the simple, folksy, homespun South,'' said Cynthia Tucker, the editorial page editor of The Constitution. But, Ms. Tucker cautioned, Ms. Sibley ''was not as one-dimensional'' as her columns about gardens and scotch pines, dogwoods and azaleas  might indicate. ''This was an intelligent woman with a lot of backbone,'' she said.         An article in The Journal-Constitution last week described Ms. Sibley's rebuff to Gov. Jimmy Carter after he had sent a letter to every state legislator disputing an article she had written about the legislative maneuvering involving one of the Governor's bills. When Mr. Carter invited her to his office to discuss the issue, she refused, saying, ''You mean you want to insult me publicly and apologize in private.''         And years after the racial turmoil of the 1960's that transformed the South, Ms. Sibley wrote a 1990 column about the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' marked by a sharpness and almost rueful tone. Writing of a scene in the movie when painfully complacent Atlantans hear themselves chastised for inaction in the civil rights battles, Ms. Sibley said, ''It was an Atlanta attitude at the time, and many Atlantans took it like Miss Daisy, listening and looking at the empty chair beside her where her black servant and best friend, Hoke, should have been sitting if her courage had matched her good will.''         Ms. Sibley also wrote 25 books, most of them mystery novels, including some that featured Kate Kincaid, a reporter at The Atlanta Searchlight.         Her first husband, Jim Little, died  at age 45. Her second husband, James Strong, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines and Mary Everitt Little-Vance of Roswell, Ga.; a son, James W. Little 5th of Alford, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Alone Thompson Patterson, an advocate of civil rights and leftist causes, a participant in the Harlem Renaissance and a longtime associate of one of its leading figures, the poet Langston Hughes, died on Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 97.         The 1920's and 30's saw an artistic and literary flowering in Harlem and an outpouring of social criticism examining the position of blacks in American society. Soon after her arrival in 1928, Mrs. Patterson, then Louise Thompson, gravitated toward that intellectual ferment, which became known as the Harlem Renaissance.         Born in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1901, she had experienced racism while living in a succession of predominantly white towns in the Pacific Northwest, before entering the University of California at Berkeley, where she was inspired by a lecture on racism given by W. E. B. DuBois.         After graduating from Berkeley in 1923 with a degree in economics, she taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which had a black student body but a predominantly white and paternalistic administration. She supported a student strike there, then went to New York to study at the New School for Social Research under a scholarship from the Urban League.         Louise Thompson entered Harlem Renaissance circles through a friendship with the painter Aaron Douglas and his wife, Alta, and she married the writer Wallace Thurman. They separated six months later. In the late 1920's, she became a secretary to Hughes, and a long professional association and friendship began.         In 1932, after helping found a Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union, she became a leading organizer of a trip to the Soviet Union by 22 black intellectuals, journalists and writers who were to make a Soviet-sponsored movie called ''Black and White,'' about white supremacy in America.         She enlisted Hughes's participation in the trip, but the film project was canceled by Soviet authorities after the group's arrival, ostensibly because of inefficiency on the part of the Soviet film company. The real reason may have been Soviet fears that the film would create enmity in the United States and jeopardize diplomatic recognition.         Louise Thompson enjoyed her experience of Soviet society and told how ''the Russians would push us to the front of the queue line for a bus or ticket, or offer us seats in a crowded streetcar.''         ''For all of us who experienced discrimination based on color in our own land, it was strange to find our color a badge of honor, our key to the city, so to speak,'' she said.         The group eventually split into two factions. Those who saw Louise Thompson as too trusting of the Russians nicknamed her Madame Moscow.         After returning to the United States, she organized a march to Washington to speak out on the ''Scottsboro Boys'' -- nine black youths wrongly convicted of raping two white women in Scottsboro, Ala. She later traveled to Spain on behalf of the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.         She was an organizer of Vanguard, a left-wing salon organized at her Harlem apartment in the 1930's for cultural presentations and discussions of Marxist theory. In 1938, she helped Hughes start the Harlem Suitcase Theater, where he presented his play with music ''Don't You Want to Be Free?'' Hughes dedicated his 1942 collection of poems, ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' to her.         In 1940, having moved to Chicago, Louise Thompson married William Patterson, a figure in the American Communist Party. He died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, MaryLouise Patterson of Manhattan, two granddaughters and a great-grandson.       
         Frances Knight, who ran the United States Passport Office for 22 years with efficiency and conservative zeal, denying passports and entrance visas to those she regarded as enemies of the nation and surviving efforts to remove her and even mandatory retirement at 70, died on Sept. 11 in a hospital in Bethesda, Md. She was 94.         Frances Knight Parrish, who used her maiden name of Knight while working at the State Department rather than her married name, lived at the Carriage Hill Bethesda nursing home in Bethesda, Md., for the last three years.         The conviction that guided Ms. Knight as she supervised the Passport Office was that the Government had a legal right and moral responsibility to protect American citizens from ideas and philosophies she found abhorrent, especially Communism. To people who represented such forces, she denied passports and visas, and sometimes, when she was not permitted to do so by her superiors in the State Department, she went over their heads and complained to Congress.         Ms. Knight inherited her sense of mission, she said, from her predecessor, Ruth Shipley, a staunch conservative who ran the office with unchallenged authority and who hand-picked Ms. Knight as her successor in 1955. She served until 1977, when she was 72.         Ms. Knight's convictions and fearlessness attracted powerful friends and allies like J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. Director, and powerful members of Congress like Representative Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania, who headed the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization.         She drew fire from liberals who accused her of practicing thought control and perpetuating many of the strict travel regulations imposed in the most bitter days of the cold war.         But Ms. Knight won praise from both conservatives and liberals for running a highly efficient agency at a time when Americans were traveling overseas in previously unimaginable numbers.         In a 1960 interview, she said, ''I was determined to prove that a Government agency could be made efficient; that business management and standards could be instituted and sustained; that Government employees could provide the public with interested, friendly and personalized public service.''         Ms. Knight was also outspoken on equal rights for women. She often complained about the lack of women in high-ranking management positions in the State Department.         She raised a furor in Congress in 1963 when it came to light that she had told a closed meeting of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that she had been ordered by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to approve passport applications by ''dangerous undercover Communists engaged in espionage, sabotage and sedition.''         She testified that Mr. Rusk's order and departmental regulations ''in effect forbids us to protect ourselves,'' and she questioned ''whether there exists the will'' to defend the country from ''the inroads of Communism.''         In 1966, Abba P. Schwartz, the liberal-minded head of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, a Kennedy appointee, tried unsuccessfully to force her to resign because of their political differences.         Ms. Knight called a news conference in which she declared: ''Some creeps are out to get me.''         She also sought the help of J. Edgar Hoover and powerful members of Congress, and in the end it was Mr. Schwartz who was forced to resign.         After that, her critics in Congress referred to her as ''the ogress'' and the columnist Mary McGrory likened Ms. Knight to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.         But her friends in Congress twice permitted her to remain on the job at the Passport Office after she had reached mandatory retirement age.         Ms. Knight was born in Newport, R.I., and grew up in New York City. She attended Hunter College and New York University. She moved to Washington when her husband, Wayne Parrish, a magazine publisher, was offered the editorship of a Washington-based aviation magazine.         Mr. Parrish soon became a multimillionaire and the couple lived on Embassy Row in Washington.         He later started his own publication, with his wife dealing with the bookkeeping and circulation.         Mr. Parrish died in 1984. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader who in 1957 led the fight to admit nine black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., died yesterday at a hospital there. She was 84.         In the integration struggle, rocks were thrown through her window, a burning cross was placed on her roof and the newspaper published by her and her husband, L. C. Bates, was ultimately destroyed financially. But she nurtured the nine black children who faced vicious insults and physical intimidation. She encouraged them to be courageous, while striving to guard them against howling white mobs.         The result was one of the early major victories in the civil rights movement. The desegregation of Central High School with the aid of federal troops signaled that Washington would enforce the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, which declared school segregation unconstitutional.         Mrs. Bates, as Arkansas president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was a central figure in the litigation that led to the confrontation in front of Central High, as well as the snarling scenes that unfolded in front of it.         The success of the Little Rock campaign, she later said, ''had a lot to do with removing fear that people have for getting involved.''         In her forward to Mrs. Bates's 1962 book, ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock,'' Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, ''I have paid her homage in my thoughts many times and I want to tell her again how remarkable I think she was through these horrible years.''         President Clinton yesterday called her a dear friend and a heroine and said her death ''will leave a vacuum in the civil rights community, the State of Arkansas and our country.''         Daisy Bates was born in the little sawmill town of Huttig in southern Arkansas, growing up in a shotgun shack, so called because one could stand at the front door and fire a shotgun straight through the back door into the yard. She attended segregated schools that used out-of-date textbooks passed on from white schools, according to the African-American Almanac.         In her book, she told of the trauma of learning at 8 that her mother had been killed in a rape attempt by three white men. After she had heard rumors, her father told her the truth in simple and straightforward terms. ''So happy once,'' she wrote, ''now I was like a little sapling which, after a violent storm, puts out only gnarled and twisted branches.''         When she was about 15, an insurance agent came to visit her home. He was L. C. Bates, who had studied journalism and then worked for newspapers in Colorado and Kansas City. Newspapers were a shaky calling in the Depression, and he had turned to selling insurance.         After a courtship, the two married and settled in Little Rock. Together, they started a newspaper called The Arkansas State Press. It reported extensively on racially motivated violence and became known as a strong exponent of civil rights. After being elected state N.A.A.C.P. president in 1952, and as a result of the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Mrs. Bates became a particularly forceful advocate of desegregation. She began by taking black children to white schools to be registered. If the school refused, as they always did, she would report it in her paper.         In Arkansas, local and state officials initially tried to delay school desegregation, ostensibly to make the process more orderly. This resulted in a suit by the N.A.A.C.P. to force the issue. At Central High, 75 black students initially registered, a number that was ultimately reduced to 9 chosen by school authorities. They were deemed the most emotionally mature.         But Gov. Orval Faubus, responding to political urging from other Southern governors as well as polls showing that 85 percent of the state's residents opposed school desegregation, sent in the National Guard to stop blacks from attending. Governor Faubus said that ''blood would run in the streets'' if they tried. A forewarning of the escalating tension was a rock tossed through the Bateses' window. A note was tied to it, saying: ''Stone this time. Dynamite next.''         The first day of school, the black  students were turned away with bayonets at the schoolhouse door. Racial and sexual epithets were hurled at them. Mr. and Mrs. Bates were at the scene. The next day, the National Guard stepped in again.         Then President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent in the federal troops, rebuffing Governor Faubus's pleas for a one-year cooling-off period. In her book, Mrs. Bates tells of waiting for a call from the school superintendent telling her to bring the children the next day. She had told the parents that if they did not hear from her by 10 p.m. to take their phones off the hook and get some sleep. But the superintendent called after that and said that the next day, Sept. 24, the children should come to school.         Mr. and Mrs. Bates spent the next three hours visiting the parents. The next morning all the children showed up at the Bates home to be picked up by a military convoy.         ''My eyes none too dry, I saw the parents with tears of happiness in their eyes as they watched the group drive off,'' Mrs. Bates wrote.         Two years later, the Bateses'  newspaper closed as advertisements slowed to almost nothing. She served in various civil rights positions both locally and nationally and was the only woman who spoke at the March on Washington in 1963. In an interview in 1986, she said: ''I'm 75 and a half. But I'm not too tired to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I would like to see before I die that blacks and whites and Christians can all get together.''         In recent years, Mrs. Bates suffered a series of strokes. ''She just wore out,'' her niece, Sharon T. Gatson, said.         She is survived by four brothers,  Leo Gatson of Strong, Ark., Kucas and Lowell Gatson of Spearville, La., and Emmitt Gatson of Detroit.         On Monday, her body will lie in state on the second-floor rotunda of the Arkansas Capitol. Just a few feet away is the office where Governor  Faubus orchestrated the 1957 confrontation.       
         Mary C. Weitzman, who was a chorus girl as a teenager, a college freshman at 35, later a professor and finally a respected medical researcher, died on Saturday at a Manhattan hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         As a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, she worked on isolating microscopic samples of endocrine hormones from the eyestalks of Bermuda land crabs, some of which she captured herself. The work provided evidence for the once radical but now established theory that nerves secrete hormones in small but extremely influential quantities.         Until a year ago, Dr. Weitzman was still taking two subways and a bus to work each day from her Upper West Side apartment. It was the last leg of a journey that began in Norfolk, Va., where she was born in 1914 to two poor Eastern European immigrants. She dropped out of high school to dance in a chorus line, much to the delight of her father, a frustrated vaudevillian.         She married J. Daniel Weitzman, an investor and art collector, who made headlines in the 1970's when more than $400,000 of his artworks were stolen from his home by three gunmen who left him bound and gagged.         The Weitzmans were involved in the early stages of the civil rights movement, even before it was generally called that, and in 1948 they opened the Dupont Theater, the first desegregated theater in Washington.         Because of the Weitzmans' politics, the American Legion picketed the theater and Hollywood distributors cut off the supply of films. The Dupont therefore came to specialize in foreign and avant-garde films. Chess tables and espresso added to the bohemian atmosphere.         In 1949, the Weitzmans, neither of whom had graduated from high school, enrolled at George Washington University. Mr. Weitzman dropped out because of a business deal. Mrs. Weitzman went on to earn a master's degree.         In 1957, the couple moved to New York City when Mrs. Weitzman was accepted by Einstein's doctoral program, which at the time was jointly administered by Columbia University. She received her doctorate in 1963, staying on to join the Einstein anatomy department.         For years, she single-handedly published Bibliographica Neuroendocrinologica, an abstract of the world's research in her field. Colleagues said that part of her motivation was to spread new findings to third world countries. She personally translated articles from German, French, Spanish and Russian.         Her research was done with two other Einstein scientists, Berta and Ernst Scharrer, who are often credited as founders of endocrinology, which describes how hormones control the nervous system.         The Weitzmans were divorced in 1962. Mr. Weitzman died in 1980.         Dr. Weitzman is survived by two sons, Donald, of Brookline, Mass., and David, of Orinda, Calif.; a sister, Frances Pasmanick of Washington; two brothers, Harold Cohen of Arlington, Va., and Norman Cohen of Venice, Calif.; and five grandchildren.         Dr. Weitzman's impact was as much human as scientific, said Sam Seifter, a professor of biochemistry at Einstein. She worked with students one-to-one in the laboratory, devoted herself to helping minority students, and often counseled students on personal problems.         Sometimes, in the anatomy department's lunchroom, her colorful past would return when she burst into song; she favored old-time show tunes, the Loyalist songs of the Spanish Civil War and the anthems of the civil rights movement.       
         Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition from Bangladesh.         As the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about 10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on Wednesday in Dhaka.         Born into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious fundamentalism.         ''This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the ceremony. ''This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building up womenfolk as self-reliant.''         Sufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer. As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education, but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's encouragement.         She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and Mr. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married Kamaluddin Ahmed.         In addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three great-granddaughters.         She published her first story at 14,  and her prose and poems drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions. She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.         ''The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview earlier this year. ''There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family also believed that women should stay out of it.         ''But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali from people working in the house.'' That became the language she used for her writing.         Though she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970's she worked to help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the Bangladeshis considered war criminals.         In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.         ''My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ''Be poor or middle class or upper class, the violence against women in family, society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited and deprived of opportunities.''         In 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her execution as punishment for her denunciation of the fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of reprisals.         Ms. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have appeared in her poems rather than her prose.         One poem, ''Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with the following lines:         For our language many have died,         drawn from the arms of our mother         but down the road, smeared with their blood         I hope freedom will come to this land:         the simple language of a simple people         Will meet the demands of this our land.         Before her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried. Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview earlier this year, suggest why.         ''Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said. ''Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack courage.''       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''
