         Margarete Schutte-Lihotzky, an Austrian architect known for her work in Weimar Germany and for being jailed for her role in the Austrian resistance against Nazism, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Vienna. She was 102.         Peter Scheifinger, president of an organization of Austrian architects and related professionals, summed up her importance in an Austrian daily newspaper, Der Standard: ''With her concern for social welfare and her unyielding anti-fascism, she erected socially significant road signs for the Republic of Austria that extended beyond her artistic field of endeavor.''  Miss Lihotzky was born in Vienna, the daughter of an Austrian civil servant. In 1915 she enrolled in what is now the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna. She studied architecture and went on to design structures including public housing for working people.         In 1926 she moved to Germany. There she became a member of a team assembled by Ernst May, who was Frankfurt's architect and overseer of city planning in the late 1920's. Peter G. Rowe, a Harvard professor of architecture, wrote about her work in his book ''Modernity and Housing.'' A particularly interesting and praiseworthy achievement of hers, Professor Rowe wrote, was her innovative design of a standardized kitchen.         ''It was a kitchen in the form of a laboratory, with specific types of work surfaces, drawers, and cabinets for specific functions and utensils,'' he wrote. Mass production of her kitchens began in 1927; 10,000 of them were added to housing units in Frankfurt.         In 1927 she married Wilhelm Schutte, and the couple moved to the Soviet Union in 1930. Her work ranged from architectural designs for kindergartens to planning for heavy industry centers. In 1938 she took a post with the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul and designed school buildings. In the late 1930's she joined the Communist Party.         In 1940 she journeyed from Turkey to Austria on a clandestine mission involving Austria's Nazi resistance. Accounts of her resistance activity differ, but a Swiss newspaper, Neue Zurcher Zeitung, reported last year that she went to Austria to intensify the relationship between the Istanbul section of the Austrian Communist Party and the resistance network inside Austria.         ''In Vienna she worked closely with the leader of the resistance movement, Erwin Puschmann,'' the Swiss newspaper said. But during the war,  ''She was arrested and condemned to death,'' the account said. ''At the last moment, her sentence was commuted to 15 years in prison.''         After World War II, the newspaper said, she was released from a prison in southern Germany. An Austrian television film about her experiences,  ''One Minute of Darkness Does Not Make Us Blind,'' was made in 1986.         In 1946 she returned to Austria, where she became the leader of the Federation of Democratic Women, which was close to the Communist Party, to which she still belonged. Her party membership prevented her from getting more than a handful of architectural assignments in that period of cold war tension.         But in 1980 she received the Architecture Award of the City of Vienna.  She went on to receive other honors and was much written about by the press at the time of her 100th birthday.         In 1988 she was offered the Austrian Medal for Science and Art, but she declined it then since it would have been presented by Austria's president at the time, Kurt Waldheim, who had been accused of suppressing his Nazi past. Years later, she accepted it.       
         Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the 20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil, died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Wednesday. She was 101 and lived in Seattle.         Since the early 1960's Ms. Wolf was a leader in the Audubon Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its newsletter until her death.         Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who profiled her in his 1995 book ''Coming of Age,'' that she intended to live until the year 2000. ''Then I'm going,'' she said.         Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes, recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.         But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues, peace, feminism and immigration.         Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter, finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.         She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies, unemployment aid and social security.         Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later, was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to evict a family. ''I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ''As the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in despair and frustration.''         Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not clear who was working for whom.         The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ''The foreign born were the earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years ago in a talk to a high school class. ''They still have a hard and uncertain life.''         In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ''What a wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.         ''I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.         But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at members.tripod.com/HazelWolf). Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the Western Outdoor Clubs.         ''One of her major causes was always for labor to join with environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups in their movement.         ''People gang up to protect all kinds of things -- civil liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ''It's in our genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''         Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration Lawyers Association last year, ''We lost most of the battles but we won the war in all of them.''         She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate with friends. ''I proposed the following toast: 'To hell with Queen Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.' ''         She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles, five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in divorce.         Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early 1960's. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the earth with a silent spring with no song birds, but more than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching (specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods) that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon. For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.         But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest, she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to do so: the fish are ''good to eat.''         And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ''spare that tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes, furniture, paper and ''probably even skateboards.''       
         Jane B. Davies, an independent architectural historian whose devotion took her from reference librarian at Columbia University to pre-eminent authority on the 19th-century American architect Alexander J. Davis, died on Feb. 9. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Although she never received a degree in art or architectural history, Ms. Davies was a constant presence  at universities, libraries and museums that harbored information on  her chosen subjects, A. J. Davis and the romantic movement in American 19th-century architecture.         With no more than her interest and a librarian's salary, she also became an important collector of Davis's prints, drawings and Gothic-style furniture. Some of the pieces are now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the rest of her collection will go to the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.         ''She was the person who published the most articles on A. J. Davis,'' said Amelia Peck, an associated curator in the department of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''If anyone wanted to know about any facet of Davis's career, Jane was the authority to call.''         Ms. Davies was born in 1913 in Amboy, Ill. The daughter of a small-town banker, Ms. Davies told her niece that she had ''always felt a hankering to go to New York.''         After receiving her B.A. at Wellesley College in 1935 and teaching for several years at girls' preparatory schools in Illinois and Colorado, she earned degrees in German history and library science at Columbia University in 1942 and 1944. Ms. Davies became a reference librarian and rare books cataloguer at Columbia.         In 1942 she married a musician, Lyn Davies, against her father's wishes. Her brother, Warren H. Badger, a lawyer, gave the couple money that they quickly spent on acquiring an architectural print by Piranesi. Mr. Davies became an organist and choirmaster and in his free time a composer. He died in 1994.         Ms. Davies's interest in Davis began in the late 1950's. At the time, nobody else was studying Davis, a  prolific contributor to Victorian picturesque architecture and the designer of landmarks including the Wadsworth Atheneum (with Ithiel Town) in Hartford; Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, N.Y., and the United States Customs House in Manhattan (with Town and others).         Ms. Davies, who friends described as a tiny woman with a quiet but commanding presence, was soon a familiar figure poring over Davis documents at Avery Library, the New-York Historical Society, the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum.         When financial problems led the the New-York Historical Society to sell some Davis drawings, Ms. Davies bought several and donated them to Avery Library. She wrote frequently about Davis for scholarly journals and exhibition catalogs and contributed the article on Davis to the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects.         Her introduction to the 1980 reprint of Davis's Rural Residences, the first American pattern book of architectural house plans, was hailed by the Journal of Architectural Historians as ''a herculean task'' prepared by ''a scholar known to every historian of American architecture.''         The greatest recognition of her achievement came with the 1992-93 exhibition ''Alexander Jackson Davis, American Architect,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for which she was the consulting curator.         She is survived by her brother, of Dixon, Ill.         For more than 30 years, Ms. Davies worked on a critical biography of the architect, which she may not have completed; other architectural historians did not produce such a biography, leaving the field to her.         ''We were all rooting for her to get her book, the definitive study on Davis, done,'' said Richard Jenrette, the financier and collector of 19th-century American houses. ''I wouldn't be surprised if she had it hidden away somewhere.''       
         Jacqueline Auriol, the glamorous French flier who set several speed records as one of the world's leading military test pilots in the 1950's and 60's, died Saturday at her Paris home. She was 82.         Ms. Auriol was born to the world of fine boarding schools and country manors and married the son of the man who would become president of France. However, she would eventually transcend her role as the official tea pourer of Elysee Palace to succeed in a field that had been almost entirely masculine, except for Hanna Reitsch of Germany, a test pilot for the Third Reich.         Ms. Auriol's life was transformed when her face was crushed in a 1949 accident in a plane in which she was a passenger. She endured 33 plastic surgery operations over the next three years. (She did not see her two sons, Jean-Claude and Jean-Paul, until her face was as restored as possible. It seemed to work: a newspaper commented that her nose might now be American, but her smile remained unmistakably French.)  Rather than discouraging her, the experience turned her resolve to achieving greatness in the air.         Though she had learned stunt flying before her accident, her goal became nothing less than breaking the sound barrier. She watched the Vampire fighter being built in 1951 and eagerly volunteered to be one of the first to fly it.         ''That day I experienced a sense of completeness,'' she told Collier's magazine, ''an extraordinary sensation of power.''         But she had to settle for being the second woman to break the sound barrier, in 1953. The first was Jacqueline Cochran, an American, earlier that year. The two Jacquelines were to become famous rivals, as each in turn would edge beyond the other in speed.         Jacqueline Douet was born on Nov. 5, 1917, at Challans, a small town on the Bay of Biscay. Her father, Pierre Douet, was a wealthy shipbuilder. She spent most of her childhood at Nantes, then studied art in Paris at L'Ecole du Louvre. On weekends, she would ski in the French Alps.         In 1936, she meet her future husband, Paul Auriol, through a friend who was a ski champion. His father, Vincent, was a prominent leader of the Socialist Party. Both families opposed an alliance between Socialists and wealthy industrialists, so they insisted they were too young to marry. She was sent to Sweden, while Paul toured Italy.         However, two years after their original meeting, they married at a small mountain chapel. They divorced in 1967 and remarried in 1987. She was later widowed. Only her two sons survive her.         When World War II broke out, she refused to leave France while her husband was in the resistance movement. She lived in hiding under a false identity. ''I began to realize that I loved danger,'' she told The Washington Post in 1970.         After the war, her father-in-law became president and she, her husband and Jean-Paul, her older son, moved into Elysee Palace. She soon realized ''the parties and receptions were not enough to keep my interest.'' At dinner one night, she sat next to a flying ace and was so captivated by his stories that she asked if she and her husband could take flying lessons from him.         ''It was very difficult politically for my father-in-law because so few women flew at this time,'' she said.  ''I was pretty and I knew I was pretty. There was publicity and I began to be heavily criticized for my flying.''         The result was that her husband gave up flying, while she dropped out of the social and political life to devote herself to it. Then the accident happened. ''I was broken into a million pieces,'' she said. ''I had no face, no nose, nothing.'' She needed a new purpose in life. ''I had the chance of my life to really become a good pilot,'' she said. ''Now that my beauty was gone I would have to derive a reason for being from the plane which had taken it away.''         As an aviatrix, as Current Biography listed her in its 1950's coverage of her achievements, she succeeded greatly, flying more than 100 types of aircraft. She received aviation awards from Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. She was decorated with France's Legion d'Honneur and wrote an autobiography called ''Vivre pour Voler,'' meaning living for flying. At her death, Jacques Chirac, President of France, called her ''the incarnation of courage and modernity for the French people.''         Her conception of modernity did not include all of feminist philosophy. ''These very feminist women irritate me when they say, 'Men hold me back,' '' she said. ''It's not true.''         But she never undervalued the effect of luck. She had a narrow brush with death in 1956, for example, when her Mystere IV plane went into spin and she managed to bring it back under control only a few dozen yards from the ground.         It was all worth it. In the Colliers interview, she spoke of the rows of flowers on the grounds of Elysee Palace. ''Poor creatures,'' she said, ''guardians and ornaments of the Elysee. Once my life was like theirs.'' She then smiled broadly. ''Perhaps I should teach them to fly,'' she said.       
         Polita Grau, a member of a prominent Cuban political family who helped to spirit thousands of children out of Castro's Cuba, which later jailed her for nearly 14 years as a C.I.A. conspirator, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Miami. She was 84.         Ms. Grau, politically engaged since adolescence, spent four separate periods in exile in Miami because of her work. There, many admired her for her work in helping smuggle thousands of children out of Cuba in Operation Pedro Pan, a secret program run by the Catholic Church in the United States with the aid of the State Department.         She came to Miami from her native Havana for the first time during her senior year in high school, graduating there from a local parochial school.         She was a niece of Dr. Ramon Grau San Martin, a professor of physiology who served as Cuba's provisional president in 1933 and '34 and as president from 1944 to 1948. During his first term, Dr. Grau, a bachelor, made his niece, then known as Maria Leopoldina Grau, his official first lady at state events.         Dr. Grau had been a central figure in the student rebellion against President Gerardo Machado (1925-33), a nationalist who grew increasingly autocratic. Ms. Grau was involved in the campus rebellion as a member of radical and liberal student groups.         Born into a wealthy family, she at first also supported the movement that sent the dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile in 1959. But her enthusiasm for the ensuing Castro regime did not last when it instituted its program of nationalizing businesses.         With her brother, Ramon Grau Alsina, she helped send some 14,000 children to Miami in the early 1960's. They were the offspring of parents who feared their Communist indoctrination or were involved in the anti-Castro resistance.         Once in the United States, they were placed by the church in camps or foster homes; some of them were never reunited with their parents.         Ms. Grau and her brother were arrested in 1965 and accused of plotting to overthrow Fidel Castro, who was then Cuba's prime minister. They were convicted for their role in Pedro Pan and of having had dealings with the Central Intelligence Agency, which denied the connection.         Both got 30-year sentences, but Ms. Grau was freed in 1978 when Mr. Castro released a large number of political prisoners as part of a relaxation encouraged by President Jimmy Carter. Ramon Grau was freed in 1986 and followed her to Miami, where he died in 1998.         Ms. Grau's survivors include a daughter, Hilda Aguero, six grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Ruth Rubin, a scholar, collector and performer of Yiddish folk songs who lugged a tape recorder into hundreds of immigrants' living rooms in an effort to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition, died on Sunday in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 93.         A resident of the Sarah R. Neumann Nursing Home, she formerly lived in Manhattan.         One of the first women to become a prominent folklorist, Mrs. Rubin was also among the first American scholars to document the culture of Eastern European Jews, anticipating by decades the Yiddish revival of the 1970's. Starting in the 1930's, she amassed a collection of about 2,000 songs -- love ballads, lullabies, songs of the factories and streets -- still considered unparalleled in its scope.         ''It is arguably the most important collection, because it's so early,'' said Steven Zeitlin, the director of City Lore, the New York Center for Urban Folk Culture. ''Much of the material dies with the succession of generations. She was collecting songs from the people that learned them in the old country.''         Mrs. Rubin, whose books included ''A Treasury of Jewish Folksong'' (1950) and ''Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish Folksong'' (1963), also performed the songs in concert and on records. Her studio recordings, first made for Folkways in the 1940's, are available through the Smithsonian Institution.         ''Eastern European Yiddish folk song,'' Mrs. Rubin wrote in the preface to ''Voices of a People,''  ''reflects vividly the life of a community of many millions over a period of many generations. In the songs, we catch the manner of speech and phrase, the wit and humor, the dreams and aspirations, the nonsense, jollity, the pathos and struggle of an entire people.''         Unlike klezmer music, which was performed primarily by men at public occasions, the songs Mrs. Rubin collected flourished in more intimate, domestic settings -- in the kitchen, over the cradle -- and were sung almost exclusively by women, a group largely ignored by the cultural chroniclers of her day.         ''While Irving Howe was writing 'World of Our Fathers,' she was, in a sense, at work on the world of our mothers,'' Mr. Zeitlin said.         Mrs. Rubin was born Rifke Rosenblatt in Montreal on Sept. 1, 1906, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia. As a young woman she moved to New York, with its swirling ferment of Yiddish music, literature and theater, and in 1929 published a volume of her own poems in Yiddish. In 1932 she married Harry Rubin, who died in 1971; the couple's only child, Michael, died in 1959. Mrs. Rubin is survived by a sister, Esther Spivack Marks, of Toronto.         In the mid-1930's Mrs. Rubin began to concentrate seriously on folklore, going on to study with the eminent Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich and, during World War II, translating diaries smuggled out of ghettos and Nazi camps. With the end of the war and the revelation of the extent of the Holocaust, and of its sweeping destruction of Yiddish culture, Mrs. Rubin became even more determined to preserve a piece of what remained by making field recordings.         Dragging her bulky reel-to-reel tape recorder from house to house in cities in Canada and the United States, she captured well-known songs like ''Roizhinkes Mit Mandeln'' (''Raisins and Almonds'') and lesser-known material like ''A Brivele der Maman'' (''A Little Letter to Mama'') and ''Oy, di lumpn /zey zenen shpionen'' (''Oh, the lumpen /  they are spies'').         In the last decades of the 20th century, Mrs. Rubin's work was a cornerstone of the Yiddish revival movement. With an older generation of Jewish singers dying off, young musicians who wanted to learn Yiddish folksongs turned to her books and records. Mrs. Rubin's field recordings are now housed in various collections, including the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.         Mrs. Rubin earned a Ph.D. in 1976 from Union Graduate School in Cleveland, writing her dissertation on the songs of Jewish women. She received an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music and YIVO's Lifetime Achievement Award, among other honors.         Although she performed in prestigious concert halls like Town Hall and the Carnegie Recital Hall, Mrs. Rubin regarded these appearances not as recitals but as links in a chain of cultural transmission she hoped would stretch far into the future.         ''She didn't try and put on any great airs,'' recalled the folk singer Pete Seeger, a longtime friend who occasionally performed with her. ''She just sang a song very simply. She was mainly interested in seeing that the song got out so that other people would learn it and sing.''       
         Natalie Davis Spingarn, a medical writer who endured multiple bouts of cancer and became a prominent spokeswoman for cancer survivors, died on June 6 in Washington. She was 78.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her son Jonathan said.         Mrs. Spingarn's latest book, ''The New Cancer Survivors: Living with Grace, Fighting with Spirit,'' was published this year. Her personal story ''Hanging in There: Living Well on Borrowed Time,'' was published in 1982.         She created the ''Cancer Survivor's Bill of Rights'' for the 75th anniversary of the American Cancer Society, said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the organization. The document, written in 1988, was widely distributed among those with cancer, and Mrs. Spingarn became an important figure in the patients' rights movement, Ms. Schellenbach said.         Mrs. Spingarn's paper demanded that patients have a say in their medical treatment, that former cancer patients be freed of any social stigma and that employers and insurance companies not discriminate against them.         Cancer pervaded Mrs. Spingarn's life and the lives of many around her.  She had a mastectomy in 1974. But the cancer spread, first to her spine, for which she had radiation therapy in 1977, then to her hip, for which she had chemotherapy in 1979. She had a second mastectomy in 1981. Mrs. Spingarn's grandmother died of cancer. Her two sisters had breast cancer, and one died of pancreatic cancer. One of her two sons is a lymphoma survivor.         Natalie Davis was born May 26, 1922, in New York City, and reared in  New Rochelle. She graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from Vassar College in 1943, and became a journalist, then wrote on health and social policy for the federal government. In the early 1960's, she became a staff assistant to Abraham A. Ribicoff, the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and became his executive assistant when he was elected senator from Connecticut.         Mrs. Spingarn is survived by her husband, Jerome Spingarn; two sons, Jonathan of Atlanta and Jeremy of Norwood, Mass.; and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial equality in her native South Africa,  died at home in London on Monday, her literary agent, Felicity Bryan, said. She was 80.         Miss Benson's books included a novel, ''At the Still Point,'' and biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the time, written while Mr. Mandela was still serving his long prison term and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In her memoir, ''A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Miss Benson told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.         Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the cause in London.         It was Miss Benson whom Mr. Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when, after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support in West and East Africa, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the door, Mr. Mandela was standing beside him.         ''I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,'' Miss Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mr. Mandela paced up and down her apartment, brimming with ideas. ''He talked so excitedly and with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''         Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo ship as a teenager, using a mix of charm and determination to win interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she then wrote.         Restless and daring, Miss Benson served as an aide to various British generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming secretary to the director David Lean.         It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' that Miss Benson saw her country with new eyes and discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a correspondence with Mr. Paton (she was also to develop intense correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans. She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom she fell in love.         Miss Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of the defense fund for the 156 people, Mr. Mandela among them, who had been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her life, Miss Benson turned her attention to writing. When the African National Congress was banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mr. Mandela when he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a car in which he posed as her chauffeur.         Among Miss Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed African National Congress, published in the United States as ''South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials that resulted in long prison terms for the A.N.C.'s members, Miss Benson was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years -- for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed -- but continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990's. She never married.         Among other projects, Miss Benson also edited Athol Fugard's ''Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She was also the author of ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater.''         On the occasion of Miss Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mr. Mandela sent a message from South Africa. ''It reminds me of all the great help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he wrote. ''I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous friendship over half a lifetime.''         Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about the South African writer Mary Benson misstated the title of one of her books. It is ''Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater,'' not ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith.''       
         Alice Lord Landon, a pioneer in women's swimming and diving who was a presence on the American Olympic scene for eight decades, died last Thursday at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 98.         At age 13, Alice Lord swam nine miles across Long Island Sound. At 18, she was a platform diver on the first United States women's swimming team in the Olympics.         At 82, she led the procession of American athletes at the Los Angeles Olympics, wearing a replica of her uniform from the 1920 Games at Antwerp, Belgium.         And at 94, she carried the torch for the Atlanta Games when it moved through Daytona Beach, Fla.         ''Alice was the grand dame of the Olympians,'' said Dorothy Franey Langkop, honorary executive director of United States Olympians, an association of former competitors that the diver and her husband, the Olympic high-jump champion Dick Landon, helped found in the mid-1940's.         Lord Landon was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1993.         She was evidently the oldest female American Olympian, according to the United States Olympic Committee. Hal Prieste, 103, who won a diving bronze medal for the United States in 1920, is listed as the oldest living American Olympian.         Growing up in Brooklyn and then Westchester County, Alice Lord was encouraged by her father to pursue physical fitness.         ''My brother and I walked 20 miles a day,'' she would recall. ''I swam distance, going a little further and faster every day, but not for competition. I wasn't working to make the Olympics, because I didn't know what the Olympics were.''         She began competing with the newly formed Women's Swimming Association of New York, which dominated the emerging sport. But diving conditions were primitive. The practice pools were often only 6 feet deep, forcing Lord Landon to snap forward quickly and cup her hands after entering the water to keep her head from hitting the bottom.         Competing at the 1920 Games, she was handicapped by the lack of a coach and failed to make the finals in platform diving. But her teammates from the swimming association were among the stars of the Games. Aileen Riggin Soule, now 94, won the gold medal in springboard diving, and Ethelda Bleibtrey captured three golds in swimming to lead an American women's sweep.         On the ship going to Antwerp, Alice Lord met Dick Landon, and the high-jumper and the diver were married two years later in a burst of publicity over their Olympic romance.         ''He got so tired of answering how we met,'' she remembered long afterward. ''Finally he answered that we met in midair: he was going up and I was going down.''         Lord Landon remained active in the Olympic movement. She was an official of United States Olympians, held the starter's gun for women's swimming in the Olympic trials during the 1920's and 1930's, helped choose team uniforms and raised money for the United States squads.         She is survived by a daughter, Bunny McMunn, of Ormond Beach; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild. Her husband died in 1971.         Although she promoted the Olympic movement, Lord Landon spoke out on its blemishes. She felt that the Olympic ideal of placing participation above winning was violated when winners were honored but losers were forgotten.         ''The creed is fine,'' she said. ''It hasn't always been lived up to.''       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Virginia Admiral, an American painter and writer who studied with Hans Hofmann, died on July 27. She was 85 and lived in New York City.         Ms. Admiral was born in Oregon and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. While working on the Federal Arts Project in Oakland, Calif., in 1938, she became closely involved with the San Francisco poetry scene. With the poet Robert Duncan she published a single issue of a small-press magazine, Epitaph, which developed into The Experimental Review. Later, in New York, she wrote for True Crimes magazine.         In 1940 she enrolled at the Hofmann School in New York to study painting, where she met the artist Robert De Niro, who was working as a class monitor. They married in 1942; their son, the actor Robert De Niro, was born in 1943 and lives in New York City. Ms. Admiral's husband died in 1993. She is survived by a sister, Eleanor Haefele of Sacramento, and five grandchildren.         In 1942 Ms. Admiral exhibited in the Springs Salon for Young Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in Manhattan. She had a solo show there in 1946 and was included in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection at the Venice Biennale in 1947.         In the 1960's Ms. Admiral was active in the antiwar movement, often contributing work to shows based on political themes. She was also instrumental in establishing low-cost housing for artists in SoHo. From 1973 to 1980 she showed at Buecker and Harpsichords gallery.         Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in  New York and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.       
         Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.         Mrs. Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960's. She helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated 10,000 black adults were registered.         At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of black adults were not registered. Thanks largely to Mrs. Devine, blacks began to show up at the county courthouse almost daily, demanding to register.         She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer. Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, of which Mrs. Devine was a founder.         After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run, but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom Democrats and calls for Congressional investigations into voting in Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the civil rights struggle.         In the 1960's she also helped found the Child Development Group of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community support.         Mrs. Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Halsell, a journalist whose curiosity about ''a wider world'' led her to experience life on society's fringes by disguising herself as women of different races, died on Aug. 16  in Washington, where she lived. She was 77.         Inspired by John Howard Griffin's 1961 book ''Black Like Me,'' in which the author darkened his skin to pass as black, Ms. Halsell took pills that were used to alleviate pigmentation problems, supplemented by extensive tanning sessions, to cross the color barrier. Further transformed by a wig and dark contact lenses, she moved in 1968 first to Harlem and then to the Deep South, where at the height of the civil rights movement she took a job as a cleaning woman.         She wrote about this in her 1969 book, ''Soul Sister,'' in which she described the anonymity and degradation of being a black domestic in a world of white employers, one of whom tried to rape her. The book sold more than one million paperback copies and was translated into six languages.         ''Soul Sister'' was followed in 1973 by ''Bessie Yellowhair,'' based on her life on a Navajo reservation and as a American Indian nanny for a Los Angeles family, and in 1978 by ''The Illegals,'' in which she wrote of crossing the border with a group of Mexican immigrants. In the 1980's she lived undercover with a group of Christian fundamentalists.         The daughter of a West Texas cattleman, she was reared on her father's tales of frontier life on the Great Plains. ''I never felt anything I did was anything at all compared to his stories,'' she wrote in her 1996 autobiography, ''In Their Shoes.''         After high school she accepted a job at The Avalanche-Journal, the only newspaper in Lubbock, Tex., where she attended a local college while working full time. She eventually studied anthropology at Columbia University and in 1945 became the first woman to cover the police beat at The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. While working as a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Houston Post in the mid-1960's she was recruited by President Lyndon B. Johnson for a secretarial position on his White House staff. When she told him she did not take dictation, she was assigned to write official statements and became the highest ranking woman on his staff during her three-year tenure.         She is survived by a brother and a sister, both of Texas.         Shortly after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ms. Halsell left the White House for the journey she described as ''embracing the Other.''         ''I wanted to strip myself to see who I was, to see if there was anything there,'' she said.       
         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Sophie Koulomzin, a leading Orthodox Christian educator whose life encompassed the history of 20th-century Russia and the experience of Russian emigres, died in Valley Cottage, N.Y., on Friday. She was 96.         A longtime seminary instructor in the United States, she wrote widely used textbooks and church histories for use by emigres and lived to see them published in Russia, where she visited and lectured in the last few years of her life.         She was born Sophie Schidlovsky  in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1903, the daughter of Sergei Schidlovsky, the last vice president of the Czar's Duma, or Parliament.         A life of privilege was replaced by one of poverty as the family endured the first years of Soviet rule, then fled, first to Estonia, where her father died, then Berlin, then Paris.         In Germany, she studied philosophy at the University of Berlin and took part in philosophical discussions led by Nikolai Berdyaev, the Rev. Sergius Bulgakov and Semyon Frank, leading Russian religious thinkers and former Marxists who became liberal Christians and were expelled from the Soviet Union by Lenin in 1922. They were formative in her development as a broad-minded Orthodox Christian activist.         In 1926, a scholarship from the John D. Rockefeller Fund took her to the United States, where she graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in religious education.         Returning to Paris, she became a leader of the Russian Christian Student Movement, taught emigre children and edited two volumes of church school lessons. The student organization was financed by the Young Men's Christian Association, which at the time actively supported the efforts of Russian emigres to establish their church in exile.         Mrs. Koulomzin also did social work among poor Russian emigres, working with Elizabeth Skobtsova, who became an Orthodox nun known as Mother Maria and died in the Ravensbruck concentration camp after trying to help save Jews during the German occupation.         Mrs. Koulomzin was married in 1932 to Nikita Koulomzin, an engineer who was also of aristocratic descent, who survives her. She is also survived by their daughters, Elizabeth Lopukhin, Olga Poloukhine and Xenia Kalinin; their son, George; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Surviving the occupation, the family lived in Paris and then in the French provinces, where they helped Soviet prisoners of war taken by the Germans.         In 1948, the Koulomzins moved to Nyack, N.Y. Mrs. Koulomzin worked as a religious educator, creating an English-language education program and lecturing across the country. She founded the Orthodox Christian Education Commission to coordinate the work of the various Orthodox Christian ethnic groups in America.         Beginning in 1954, she taught for nearly 20 years at St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, N.Y.,         After her official retirement in 1974, she continued working. At the time of her death she was president of Religious Books for Russia, founded to send Bibles and religious literature to Russia; it has continued its work in Russia.         Mrs. Koulomzin's books, including ''God Is With Us,'' ''History of the Orthodox Church'' and 'Our Church and Our Children,'' have become classic texts in Orthodox religious education. In recent years her books were widely published in Russia. Her memoir, ''Many Worlds: A Russian Life,'' written when she was 77, ends with an account of her first visit back to her homeland, in 1970.         ''Now I had again come briefly in touch with life there and suddenly I realized that there was no absolute break, no complete separation,'' she wrote. ''My life, my own life, such as it was, came easily in touch with the flow of life that went on in Russia. I was together with Russia in the life of the Church, I was together with Russia in the search for spiritual values that is going on there.''       
         Ruth Belcher Dyk, one of the last surviving participants in the women's suffrage movement, died in her apartment in Rochester on Nov. 18. She was 99.         In a life that included working with delinquent girls, writing three books on psychology and producing anthropological studies of Navajo Indians with her husband, she never lost her fierce commitment to equality.         Only the protests of family members prevented her from going door to door in her wheelchair to canvass for Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial campaign in New York this fall. ''If I have learned one thing, New York needs a woman's touch,'' she said at rally for Mrs. Clinton on Aug. 22.         ''My mother was a suffragette,'' she said in the opening line of the Ken Burns documentary on the suffragists, ''Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' which was shown last year on the Public Broadcasting System. Her choice of word was surprising, said her daughter, Penelope Carter, of Rochester.         ''The word suffragette reminded her of the Rockettes,'' Ms. Carter said. ''She was a suffragist.''         Mrs. Dyk's deepest inspiration was her mother, Annie Manson Belcher. She was one of the first women admitted to Tufts Medical School in the late 19th century, but school officials made her drop out when she married, Ms. Carter said. The free spirit of Mrs. Belcher, who by then was married to Arthur Fuller Belcher, a lawyer, is suggested by a family story of borrowing a minister's house for a Maine vacation. When a a house of ill repute next door burned down, Mrs. Belcher graciously invited the prostitutes to stay in the minister's house, engendering a local scandal.         Mrs. Dyk and her mother walked side by side down Beacon Avenue in Boston to demand the vote. Both were overjoyed when the 19th Amendment became part of the Constitution on Aug. 26, 1920.         ''We had worked so long,'' Mrs. Dyk said in the documentary. ''If you had worked years to do it, if you believed in it, if you thought great things were going to come out of it -- great in terms of the position of women in our culture, position of women in jobs, position of women everywhere -- and this was going to improve that . . . I mean lives would be changed.''         Later in the documentary, she said she feared that women's lives ''haven't changed as much as we hoped for.'' She told friends and family members that if women had voted as a bloc, they could have effected more change. ''I don't know if we did enough with it,'' she said.         Mrs. Clinton, however, lauded her contributions in a statement after her death. ''Her devotion to her family, her profession and her work in both the local and global community is an example for women everywhere,'' the first lady said.         Mrs. Dyk was born in Portland, Me., on March 25, 1901. She was proud to say that her pedigree included several families from the Mayflower, including Myles Standish. She grew up in Newton Center, Mass., and, like her mother, attended Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass. She earned a master's degree in economics from Simmons College in Boston, and did further graduate work at the University of Wisconsin and the University of California at Berkeley.         She worked as a psychiatric social worker with delinquent girls in upstate New York, where, among other things, she taught her clients to play pool. She worked as a researcher at what was then called the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York in Brooklyn, and was co-author of three books: ''Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth'' (Hoeber, 1950); ''Psychological Differentiation'' (Wiley, 1962); and ''Left Handed'' (Columbia University Press, 1980).         She completed the last volume with her husband, Walter Dyk, an anthropologist who studied Navajo Indians. His principal work, called ''a revelation of the real life of the tribe'' by The New Yorker, was in the form of an autobiography of one man, ''Son of Old Man Hat,'' (Harcourt Brace, 1938).         After his death in 1972, Mrs. Dyk took transcripts of taped conversations and other research and wrote ''Left Handed,'' a continuation of the first book.         Ms. Carter said her mother's strong will was evident when Mr. Dyk was suffering from Parkinson's disease and cancer and she was juggling two jobs and raising two children in the 1950's and 1960's. ''What choice did I have? I did what I had to do,'' she said.         But when she had choices, she took an unconventional approach. ''One of my earliest memories was her looking me in the eye and saying with just a bit of venom, 'Don't be so good,' '' Ms. Carter said. ''She meant you've to have some spirit, go against the grain.''         Mrs. Dyk emphasized to her daughter that it was not necessary to marry, and that it was important to get the education that would allow her to live independently. When Ms. Carter began smoking, Mrs. Dyk said it was fine with her. With nothing to rebel against, the girl quit the next day.         In addition to Ms. Carter, Mrs. Dyk is survived by her son, Timothy, of Washington, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Dyk smoked into her 80's, drove into her 90's and voted in the recent election. She recalled how she felt when she was among the first women to vote.         ''I was terribly frightened that I would push the wrong lever,'' she said. ''I still go into that booth with the same feeling -- what if I voted Republican?''       
         Teresa Sterne, a pioneering producer of classical recordings, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Norma Hurlburt, executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.         As the director of Nonesuch Records from 1965 through 1979, Ms. Sterne turned a small budget label into one of the most adventurous companies in the recording business.  When she was invited to take charge of Nonesuch, the label was a subsidiary of the pop-oriented and profitable Elektra Records. Nonesuch's business had consisted mostly of acquiring the rights to existing recordings of Baroque music by European ensembles and reissuing them at budget prices in the United States.         Ms. Sterne, called Tracey by her friends and colleagues, brought a vision to the job born of her long experience in music. She had been a piano prodigy, and though she gave up public performance as an adult, she maintained close ties with the composers and performers of her day.         At Nonesuch she brought attention to areas of music neglected by the major labels, particularly contemporary music and American vernacular music. She championed American composers like George Crumb, Elliott Carter, Morton Subotnick, Charles Wuorinen and Donald Martino, not just recording their works but commissioning them, an unusual move for the leader of a record company. She also issued important recordings of lesser-known works by Schoenberg, Busoni, Stravinsky and other major figures.         She nurtured relationships with several excellent performers not widely known at the time, like the pianist Paul Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert Kalish. Many of the artists she discovered were first recognized  for their work in contemporary music. Ms. Sterne encouraged them to  record past works that interested them as well, like Jacobs's critically hailed recording of the Debussy etudes and Mr. Kalish's engaging survey of the Haydn piano sonatas.         The mezzo-soprano Joan Morris and her husband and professional partner, the composer and pianist William Bolcom, made some popular Nonesuch recordings of vernacular American songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And Ms. Sterne sparked a nationwide craze for ragtime with a series of Scott Joplin piano works played by Joshua Rifkin.         She was also in the forefront of the early instrument movement in Baroque and Renaissance repertory. And under her leadership, Nonesuch's Explorer series introduced music from Bali, India, Peru and other countries to a wider audience. Ms. Sterne believed that every record she produced should have a purpose, and she involved herself with everything, from the packaging to the liner notes.         But in late 1979 she was dismissed from Nonesuch. Early in her tenure the record label had been acquired by Warner Communications, and by the mid-1970's, it was grouped under a parent company, Elektra/Asylum/ Nonesuch, headed by Joe Smith. Warner officials asserted that Nonesuch was losing money. In an interview with The Boston Globe at the time, Mr. Smith said: ''Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in its marketplace. We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian Tea Room.''         Ms. Sterne argued that the losses were mostly caused by the parent company's poor marketing and distribution. A letter condemning her dismissal, written by 10 Pulitzer Prize-winning composers, including Mr. Carter and Aaron Copland, was sent to the vice president of Warner Communications and widely circulated in the press, to no avail.         Ms. Sterne never anticipated becoming a record producer. She was born in Brooklyn on March 29, 1927, to a cultured family with a toehold on the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who gave up her career to nurture her musical daughter. Ms. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, a professional violinist, became an important mentor.         From the age of 10, she was educated at home by private tutors, living with her mother and a beloved aunt in ''a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' as she once told a friend. In 1939, when she was 12, she made her professional debut as a pianist playing Grieg's Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra at Madison Square Garden. The next year she played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, winning cheers from the audience and glowing reviews from critics. Her career as a prodigy flourished.         But after such a rarefied and isolated upbringing, Ms. Sterne felt that she lacked the pragmatism and confidence to pursue a professional career. Wanting experience in the real world, she became a secretary, soon winding up in the offices of the powerful manager Sol Hurok, where she nurtured the careers of other young artists. A series of administrative jobs, including assistant to the director at Vanguard Records, led to her  hiring by Nonesuch.         Ms. Sterne, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors. After her dismissal from Nonesuch, the company went through many changes. Earlier this year, Robert Hurwitz, its director since 1984 and a great admirer of Ms. Sterne, issued a two-disc recording in tribute to her, containing highlights from favorite albums she had produced and live recordings of performances she gave in her early years as a piano prodigy.
