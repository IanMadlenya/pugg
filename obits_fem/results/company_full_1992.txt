         Diana Adler, a New York fashion designer for almost 40 years, died yesterday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         Ms. Adler died as the result of a heart ailment, said her daughter, Pamela Adler Golden of Goldens Bridge, N.Y.         Ms. Adler, who joined George Carmel Inc., maker of women's coats, suits and ensembles, in the mid-1940's, rose to become the company's head designer. In the early 1970's, she joined Baron Peters, a fashion concern with its headquarters in Lowell, Mass.         She retired in the early 1980's.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Adler is survived by her husband, Dr. Eugene B. Silbermann, a New York obstetrician and gynecologist; a stepdaughter, Allison Adler of Manhattan; a sister, Beverly Zaccheo of Long Island City, Queens; two granddaughters and a grandson.       
         Gretchen Householder Poston, the White House social secretary in the Carter Administration, died Monday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 59 years old and lived in Washington.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Poston, who was born in Minneapolis, graduated from St. Mary's College in Leavenworth, Kan., and taught school for six years before moving to Washington, where she became involved in charitable fund raising and Democratic Party activities. She worked for the campaign of every Democratic Presidential nominee from 1964 on.         Mrs. Poston was a founder and co-owner of WashingtonInc., an events-planning company begun in 1967.         In January 1977, she was appointed the White House social secretary, a post in which she organized the visit of Pope John Paul II to the White House and state dinners celebrating the Panama Canal treaty, the Camp David accords and normalized relations with China.         Leaving the White House at the end of the Carter Administration, she returned to WashingtonInc. Among the events she organized there were a dinner for recipients of the Medal of Honor; a tribute to Adm. Hyman Rickover; celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the 75th anniversary of the Brookings Institution and the 20th anniversary of National Public Radio, and a dinner honoring the Polish leader Lech Walesa during his 1989 visit to the United States.         In 1990, Mrs. Poston helped establish the Washington Race for the Cure, a five-kilometer run that had been held annually in other cities to raise awareness about breast cancer prevention and to promote support for research to find a cure.         Surviving are her husband, Raymond L. Poston of Washington; four children, Jeffrey L., Carol D., Ramsey R. and Katharene J., all of Washington, and a sister, Diane J. Welch of Kansas City, Mo.       
         Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She worked with AIDS organizations and talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission.         Mrs. Chow, known professionally as Tina Chow, began her career at the age of 16, modeling for Shiseido, a leading cosmetics company in Japan. Soon she found herself working at fashion shows and for photographers, appearing on major magazine covers and in pictures for advertisements and fashion news articles. She was a favorite model of Cecil Beaton, among other photographers.         In the early 1970's, she married Michael Chow and worked with him in running his Mr. Chow restaurant in London, a fashionable restaurant featuring Peking cuisine. Later they moved to Manhattan, opening a branch of the restaurant on 57th Street, and then to California to create a third branch in Beverly Hills. Crystals on Cords         She began designing jewelry in the mid-1980's and was a trendsetter for her use of quartz and other crystals as amulets and rings in a variety of settings and as pendants on silk cords. She had outlets in leading stores in several cities, including in Manhattan at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue and at the Ted Muehling Shop in SoHo.         More recently she had shifted into abstract and organic sculpture in crystal and furniture design.         Regularly listed as one of the best-dressed women, she acquired a large collection of designer clothes and patterns, part of which is to be shown at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan starting March 16. Rizzoli Publishing is working on a book on the collection.         She remained professionally active while fighting her illness and worked with Angel Food, an organization that delivers food to AIDS patients.         Mrs. Chow was born in Lakeview, Ohio. As a teen-ager she moved with her family to Tokyo, where her father, Walter Edmund Lutz, worked in international trade. Mrs. Chow was educated at Sophia University in Tokyo.         She was divorced from Mr. Chow. She is survived by her parents, Mr. Lutz and Mona Furuki, who now live in Los Angeles; a son, Maximillian, and a daughter, China, both of Pacific Palisades, and a sister, Adelle Lutz of Manhattan, who is the wife of the rock musician David Byrne.

She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She had talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission, and even before she knew she would be stricken, she was active in AIDS organizations because of the epidemic's toll on colleagues and friends.

         Elizabeth Ogg Walters, the author of many public affairs studies, died on Jan. 14 at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, after having been hit on Dec. 1 by a bus near her Fifth Avenue residence, said Arnold Allentuch, her executor and friend.  Mrs. Walters, who used the pen name, Elizabeth Ogg, wrote nearly 50 pamphlets dealing mainly with mental health and social problems for the Public Affairs Committee, Inc. of New York City. Her widely cited pamphlets include: "Your Nursing Services Today and Tomorrow," "A New Chapter in Family Planning," "When a Family Faces Stress" and "Good News for Stroke Victims."         British-born and educated, she came to the United States when she was 24, taught English at a private school and later became editor of Headline Books for the Foreign Policy Association. During World War II, she worked for the Office of War Information, writing instruction manuals on sonar gear for the United States Navy.         The author of several books, her latest work, "Facing Death and Loss," was published in 1985 by the Technomic Publishing Company of Switzerland.         She is survived by a nephew, Peter Ogg, and a niece, Alma Ogg of Prudhoe, Northumberland, England.       
         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.         She moved to New York to be a school librarian in Scarsdale from 1939 to 1942. She was a librarian and professor of library service at New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton from 1942-54, with a two-year leave as a visiting professor at the University of Teheran and library adviser to Iran. She also taught at the University of Virginia and Emory University.         After her retirement from Rutgers, she served as a library consultant and later vice president of Bro-Dart Inc., a wholesale book supplier. She wrote and edited numerous articles and books on libraries.         Her survivors include a sister, Lydia Harvey, also of Danville.       
         Wanda Mary Jablonski, an expert on the international oil industry and founder of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly newsletter, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said Edward L. Morse, the newsletter's publisher.         Ms. Jablonski's career began when she landed a big story in 1945 while still an office messenger at the Journal of Commerce in Manhattan. Filling in for the oil reporter and assigned to cover a news conference conducted by a Venezuelan official, she waited until the session ended to corner him for a private interview. In the interview, he disclosed plans to seize and nationalize all foreign oil operations in Venezuela. He also called for joint action by developing countries with oil reserves, an idea that culminated in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960. Savoir-Faire Was Helpful         Ms. Jablonski became the Journal's oil editor and "the most influentual oil journalist of her time," as Daniel Yergin wrote in his history of the oil business, "The Prize" (Simon & Schuster, 1990). He added that she had the "savoir-faire required to get her through all sorts of situations."         Making her way in a male-dominated industry, she befriended Texas wildcatters, Arab sheiks, corporate executives and important government figures around the globe. She traveled often, once spending six months in the desert; on a visit to Saudi Arabia, she found herself housed in the guest quarters of the king's harem.         McGraw-Hill hired her in 1954 as senior editor of its new Petroleum Week, but the magazine folded in 1961. Jobless, she founded her own weekly, which was 8 to 12 pages and printed on yellow paper. It grew steadily to a circulation in the thousands, despite an annual subscription fee in the hundreds of dollars. The current price is $1,375.         Her newsletter became required reading in the industry for information on explorations, refining, supplies, prices and political trends. The readership ranged from Central Intelligence Agency officials to Middle East rulers. Her early reports on oil company plans occasionally enraged executives, who sometimes temporarily canceled their subscriptions in protest. She sold the weekly in 1988 to the Petroleum Intelligence Group. Born in Czechoslovakia         Ms. Jablonski was born in Czechoslovakia. Her mother was a physicist; her father, Eugene, worked for the Socony Oil Company, and the family followed him around the world to England, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Texas, Europe and Morocco.         After settling in the United States in 1938, Ms. Jablonski earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1942 and a master's in journalism from Columbia University in 1943.         In recent years she worked for the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in Manhattan as the director of the National High-Risk Registry for women with a family history of breast cancer. She donated $3 million to the center.         She was married and divorced three times. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.         Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.         She had been in the Navy, as an active-duty officer or a reservist, since World War II, and received a special Presidential appointment to the rank of rear admiral in 1983. In 1982, with the retirement of Adm. Hyman J. Rickover, Admiral Hopper became the oldest officer on active duty in the armed service, which she remained until retiring herself in 1986.         Admiral Hopper made several vital contributions to the development of modern computing systems, including helping invent the Cobol programming language, which is still in widespread use in business.  Award from President         In September, President George Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology "for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users." She was the first woman to receive the award individually.         At the time of her death she was a senior consultant to the Digital Equipment Corporation. She joined Digital in 1986, shortly after her retirement from the Navy.         "Grace took every opportunity to challenge people young and old to consider the infinite possibilities of technology," said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital Equipment's president.         Admiral Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on Dec. 9, 1906, in New York City. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale, she taught math at Vassar College, her alma mater, where she later became an associate professor. She was divorced in 1945 but kept her married name.         In 1949 she worked as a mathematician at the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation. The company was formed by Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in 1946 had developed one of the world's first electronic computers, ENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. Eckert-Mauchly was then building the Univac I, the first commercial electronic computer. The company was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation.         Earlier, in 1943, Dr. Hopper had joined the Navy. As a lieutenant assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, she worked as a programmer on a calculating device called the Mark I, a precursor electronic computers.  Recalled by the Navy         Leaving the Navy in 1946, she remained at Harvard as a faculty member in the computation laboratory. She continued to work on early Navy computers and maintained her Naval career as a reservist. Although retired from the Navy reserve in 1966, then-Commander Hopper was recalled within a year to active duty to oversee a program to standardize the Navy's computer programs and languages.         In 1962, she was elected a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association selected her as its first computer sciences "Man of the Year."         Her work led to the first practical compiler for modern computers. A compiler is a program that translates instructions written by a human programmer into more specific codes that can be directly read by a computer.         Among her many contributions, Admiral Hopper is known for coining the term "bug," which is widely used to refer to mysterious computer failures.         The first bug actually was -- a moth, as Admiral Hopper told the story. It was discovered one August night at Harvard in 1945 inside the Mark I.         "Things were going badly, there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long, glass-enclosed computer," she is quoted as saying. "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth. From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."         Like another Navy figure, Admiral Rickover, Admiral Hopper was known for her combative personality and her unorthodox approach.         A self-described "boat rocker," she once said in a speech that she hoped to live until the year 2000. "I have two reasons," she said. "The first is that the party on Dec. 31, 1999, will be a New Year's Eve party to end all New Year's Eve parties. The second is that I want to point back to the early days of computers and say to all the doubters, 'See? We told you the computer could do all that.' "         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Roger F. Murray II of New Hampshire, and a sister, Mary Murray Westcote of New Jersey.       
         Gertrude Shurr, who performed in the 1920's and 30's with such pioneering American modern dance companies as Denishawn, the Humphrey-Weidman Concert Company and the early Martha Graham company, died on Thursday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 88 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Dr. Rachael Yocom, a friend.         Born in Riga, Latvia, Miss Shurr came to the United States as a child. Her first professional fee, as she later described it, was a penny she earned dancing in the streets with an organ grinder whose music she liked. She began her formal dance training at the Denishawn school of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn and also studied with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Martha Graham. Taught Notable Figures         She danced with the Denishawn company from 1925 to 1927, leaving to join the earliest Humphrey-Weidman company, with which she danced from 1927 to 1929. She left to teach at the Graham school, corralling students at other studios for Miss Graham's first classes for adults. Miss Shurr joined the Graham company in 1930, dancing in many Graham classics in her eight years there. Among them was "Primitive Mysteries," which she helped Miss Graham revive in 1982.         Miss Shurr left the Graham troupe to perform with May O'Donnell, another company member, with whom she opened a dance studio in New York City; students there included Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, who later founded the Joffrey Ballet. In the early 1940's she received bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education, specializing in dance, from San Francisco State College and the University of Oregon, respectively.         Miss Shurr taught at the High School of Performing Arts in New York for more than two decades, serving as chairman of the dance department for three years. A tiny woman with a robust sense of humor, she established a reputation as a tough but loyal and influential teacher. Her students included the entertainers Ben Vereen and Liza Minnelli. She also was assistant choreographer for the Broadway musicals "Sadie Thompson" (1944) and "Top Banana" (1951).         Miss Shurr retired in 1971 but continued to work sporadically as a rehearsal coach. She was a dance adviser for the Arizona Commission on the Arts and directed the University of Utah's Opportunity Theater and Dance Workshop, a summer program. Last year she was named an Arizona Dance Treasure by the Arizona Dance Arts Alliance.         She is survived by her brother, George, of Manhattan.       
         Mary Josephine Blair, a prominent figure in New York society for many years, died on Dec. 29 at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Mary McFadden, the fashion designer.         A skilled pianist, Mrs. Blair served on the boards of directors of the Juilliard School of Music, the Manhattan School of Music and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. With her husband, Watson Blair, she also had homes and gardens in Southampton and Brookville, L.I.         She was born in Boston to Mary and Fulton Cutting. A pioneer in the development of commercial radio, Dr. Cutting was on the board of directors of Stevens Institute of Technology.         Her first husband, Alexander Bloomfield McFadden, a cotton broker in Memphis, died, and in 1953, she married Mr. Blair, a banker with J. P. Morgan & Company.         In addition to her husband and Miss McFadden, of New York, Mrs. Blair is survived by four sons, George McFadden of New York, John H. McFadden of London, Watson B. Blair of Seattle and Wolcott R. Blair of St. Louis, and 11 grandchildren.       
         Stella Roman, a soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera Company, died on Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, said her son, Flaviu Romanul of Boston. Miss Roman was known for her interpretations of the great Italian spinto roles, including Aida, which she sang at her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1941, Tosca, Mimi in "La Boheme," Amelia in "Un Ballo in Maschera" and Desdemona in "Otello." She also appeared in German operas and was chosen by Richard Strauss to sing the role of the Empress at the Italian premiere of his "Frau Ohne Schatten" at La Scala in 1940.         She was born in Cluj, Romania, and studied in Bucharest and in Italy, where she made her formal debut in 1932. She became a member of the Rome Opera four years later, and sang in Florence, Berlin and Salzburg, Austria, and in many other European cities. She portrayed Aida in Cairo. In her 10 seasons with the Metropolitan Opera, she appeared in 126 performances, singing 13 roles. She also sang with the San Francisco, Cincinnati and other American opera companies, and appeared frequently in Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Puerto Rico.         In addition to her son, she is survived by four grandchildren.       
         Jeanne F. Bernkopf, who edited "Scarlett" and many other best-selling books, died on Monday in Manhattan.  She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She was stricken and died while riding in a taxi, her family said. No exact cause of death has been determined.         Mrs. Bernkopf edited Kitty Kelley's unauthorized biographies on Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra as well as Alexandra Ripley's "Scarlett," the sequel to "Gone with the Wind."         Several prominent writers sought her to edit their work. Joseph A. Wambaugh, for example, used her on a score of his books. Ms. Kelley and the novelist James Clavell specified in their publishing contracts that Mrs. Bernkopf be their editor. Other popular authors she edited included Michael Korda, Erich Segal, Wayne Dyer, Joshua Logan, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Bach and Robert Ludlum.         "She was really an author's editor -- strict but loving," said Lawrence Hughes, the former president of William Morrow & Company, one of the publishers for whom she worked. The others included Delacorte, Dell, Dutton, MacMillan and Bantam. She also worked as a freelance editor.         Mrs. Bernkopf was born in Manhattan and grew up there and in Woodmere, L.I. After graduating from Smith College, she went directly into publishing.         Surviving are her husband, Michael, a mathematics professor at Pace University; three stepchildren, David of Manhattan, Daniel of Highland Park, Ill., and Donald of Brooklyn, and three brothers, Charles Frank of Ardsley, N.Y., and Howard and Edward Frank, both of Boston.       
         Margaret Berol Craig, a champion shower of horses and trainer of dogs, died Monday at her home in Danbury, Conn. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Craig had been a part owner of her family's company, the Berol Corporation, the manufacturers of Eagle pencils. It was founded in Germany in the early 1800's, moved to New York City in 1856 and later to Danbury, and was sold in 1987.         She was born in Elberon, N.J. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1935 and the Columbia School of Journalism in 1940 and also attended the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons for two years.         For about 25 years she raised, trained and rode horses for show and jumping, until a back ailment forced her to quit. She then took up the training of Shetland sheepdogs for another 25 years and was the oldest trainer competing in this year's National Obedience Championship, the Gaines Classic.         She is survived by three sons, Geoffrey of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Gregory of Newington, Conn., and Gordon of Sandy, Utah; four grandchildren and a brother, E. Albert Berol of Bedford Hills, N.Y.       
         Angela Carter, a novelist and short-story writer, died at her home in London on Sunday. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for Farrar, Straus & Giroux, her publisher in New York.         Ms. Carter's work was widely praised in Britain, although less widely known in the United States. She was the author of more than a half-dozen macabre novels and a polemical study of the Marquis de Sade, "The Sadeian Woman."         Her novels included "The Magic Toyshop," "Several Perceptions" and "Nights of the Circus." A number of her works were regarded as fairy tales with modern morals. Wrote for Radio and Films         British critics often described Ms. Carter's writing style as "magic realism," but she believed the label was not quite accurate. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, she said: "It's more realism than not. I can't define it until after it's done except that it is definitely fiction. It's more in the genre of Latin American writers like Garcia Marquez and Borges."         Whatever the label, Ms. Carter's interest in fantasies, fairy tales and dreams was lifelong. She wrote radio scripts, short stories, children's books and screenplays, one of which became the 1984 film "The Company of Wolves." Her 1991 novel, "Wise Children," was about the illegitimate twin daughters of a celebrated Shakespearean actor.         Ms. Carter was born in 1940 in Eastbourne. She began her writing career as a journalist on a South London weekly, The Croydon Advertiser. Later, she studied English literature at the University of Bristol, then began to write cultural criticism for New Society, The New Statesman and other publications.         From 1976 to 1978, Ms. Carter was a fellow in creative writing at Sheffield University in England, and in 1980 and 1981 she was a visiting professor in the writing program at Brown University in Providence, R.I. She also taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.         She is survived by her husband, Mark Pearce, and a son, Alexander.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted. Flowers were her favorite subject, roses in particular. She exhibited in galleries and sold dozens of paintings for charity.         The Pickens sisters were born in Macon, Ga., and grew up there and in Atlanta. Their parents taught them to harmonize. Their father, a cotton broker, played the piano and their mother sang.         At first the sisters sang for friends, then at churches and schools. The family moved to Park Avenue in Manhattan in 1932, and a test recording for Victor made such an impression with radio executives that they hired the sisters unseen. Promoted as Three Little Maids From Dixie, they appeared in "Thumbs Up" on Broadway and in a movie, "Sitting Pretty." Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted.

         Susan Kaplan Hopwood, a marketing and sales executive in New York City, died on Feb. 8 at her home in Newtonville, Mass. She was 55 years old.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, her family said.         Mrs. Hopwood was advertising sales manager of Barron's, the business weekly, in the 1970's. Advertising lineage doubled in three years under her direction, and she helped initiate the overseas distribution for the publication. Moving to the parent of Barron's, Dow Jones & Company, she helped start "The Wall Street Journal Report" programs on radio and television.         From 1982 to 1988 she headed public relations for Advertising Age magazine. She ran its annual creative workshop, attracting marketing and advertising agencies from 47 countries, and helped institute annual awards for the best television commercials.         She also helped the International Advertising Association organize its annual conferences from 1986 to 1989, including its first gathering in Beijing. Recently she worked on marketing for the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Art News magazine and World Paper, an international news supplement for other publications.         For several years she worked on the board of the Manhattan Theater Club.         She was born in Brooklyn. Mrs. Hopwood was an alumna of Finch College and earned a master's degree in business from New York University.         Her marriage to Seymour N. Kaplan ended in divorce. Surviving are her husband, David J. Hopwood; a daughter, Kari E. Kaplan of Manhattan; a son, Kenneth N. Kaplan of Queens; her mother, Claire Nossiter of Manhattan; a brother, Robert Singer of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and three stepchildren.       
         Frances Young Tang, a philanthropist in the field of education and a preservationist specializing in landmark buildings, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old and also had homes in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Vail, Colo.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Oscar L. Tang.         The beneficiaries of Mrs. Tang's philanthropy included the Department of East Asian Studies at Duke University, the Chinese language program at Skidmore College and Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. She was a trustee of Phillips Academy at the time of her death and had been on the executive committee of the school's development board.         She was also president of Vencura Ltd., a Manhattan-based company that rehabilitates landmark buildings and has been doing work in Vail, Colo. She had also managed a Chinese catering business.         Mrs. Tang was born in Paris, the daughter of Kuangson Young, a Nationalist Chinese career diplomat who was executed during World War II by the Japanese in the Philippines. She came to the United States on an American troop ship and grew up in Manhattan.  She graduated in 1957 from Abbot Academy in Andover, Mass., which later merged with Phillips Academy, and in 1961 from Skidmore College.         She was married in 1960 to Mr. Tang, who is the president of Reich & Tang, a financial services firm with headquarters in Manhattan.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her mother, Juliana Koo of Manhattan, who is the widow of V. K. Wellington Koo, a Nationalist Chinese diplomat who was an ambassador to Washington and a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague; three daughters, Tracy Tang Limpe, Dana and Kristin, all of Manhattan; a son, Kevin, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Genevieve Young of Manhattan and Shirley Young of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Manhattan.       
         Heidi Draper, who as Heidi Vosseler was a member of George Balanchine's first American ballet company, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 74 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said her daughter, Pamela.         Miss Vosseler danced from 1935 to 1938 with the American Ballet, which was founded by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and Edward M. M. Warburg in 1934, a year after Balanchine arrived in the United States from Europe. Miss Vosseler performed in Balanchine's first American ballet, "Serenade," in his "Alma Mater," and in dances he created for two opera productions at the Metropolitan. She was featured in two Broadway musicals, "The Boys from Syracuse," choreographed by Balanchine, and "Louisiana Purchase."         Miss Vosseler married the tap dancer Paul Draper in 1941 and lived with him in Europe until returning to the United States in 1954.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, two other daughters, Susan Kosowski of Fishkill, N.Y., and Kate Draper of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.

         Helen Deutsch, the award-winning screenwriter for "Lili," "I'll Cry Tomorrow" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and co-author of "National Velvet," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 years old.         She had been under nursing care and died of natural causes, the medical examiner's office said.         Her script for "Lili" was nominated for an Academy Award in 1953 and won Cannes Film Festival and Writers Guild of America prizes and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Golden Globe award.         The film told of an orphan, played by Leslie Caron, smitten with a carnival magician. One critic, Bosley Crowther, called the movie "lovely and beguiling" and "touched with the magic of romance and the shimmer of masquerade." It later became a musical hit, "Carnival!" on Broadway.         Miss Deutsch, who never learned to type and instead relied on a old Dictaphone, was prolific. Besides her 15 screenplays, she wrote more than 20 short stories for magazines, hundreds of newspaper articles and several plays and television scripts. She was a lyricist as well. Among her songs was "Hi-Lili-Hi-Lo," which she dismissed as "dreadful." Organized Drama Critics Circle         Although not a performer, she played many other roles in show business. Early in her career she ran a theater company, worked as a publicist and covered theater for The New York Herald-Tribune and The New York Times. As a protest to the Pulitzer Prize selections, she organized the New York Drama Critics Circle. She also worked for the New York Theater Guild, and later was a production consultant for stage, film and television.         Her screenwriting career started with a smash. "National Velvet" (1944), which was about youngsters training a horse, was named one of the 10 best films that year and propelled the young Elizabeth Taylor to stardom.         That same year she followed with another acclaimed work, "The Seventh Cross," in which Spencer Tracy gave one of the best performances of his career, portraying a refugee from a Nazi death camp.         Most of her screenplays were for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and were adaptations of other works. Her range was wide, from psychological drama to outdoor adventure to musicals.         "I'll Cry Tomorrow" (1956), featuring Susan Hayward, was the true story of Lillian Roth's searing battle with alcoholism. "King Solomon's Mines" (1950) with Stewart Granger was a scenic safari picture. "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" (1964) was a big, brassy musical about a survivor of the Titanic, and the movie garnered six Oscar nominations.         But her film-writing career ended on a sour note. "Valley of the Dolls" (1967) was a steamy box office success but critically scorned. Miss Deutsch disavowed authorship and said Jacqueline Susann, on whose novel the movie was based, had meddled with the script.         For television she wrote "Jack and the Beanstalk," starring Joel Grey, for NBC in 1956. The following year she wrote "The General Motors 50th Anniversary Show."         Miss Deutsch was born in Manhattan and graduated from Barnard College in 1927. While still a senior, she started managing the Provincetown Players, continuing till the troupe went out of business. She co-wrote a book about it in 1931, "The Provincetown," which was republished in 1972. She took up freelance writing, and her stories appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and Redbook.         When Hollywood beckoned, she went to California, living there from about 1946 to 1966. Returning to the East Coast, she called herself "a recluse in New York."         Miss Deutsch was a student of medieval English, French, German and English and a Sanskrit scholar. She collected rare books and manuscripts and donated a significant collection to Boston University.         She had a brief marriage that was annulled. There are no immediate survivors.

         Roberta Bender Grossman, the president and publisher of Zebra Books, died on March 13 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Walter Zacharius, the chairman of Kensington Publishing Corporation, which owns Zebra Books.         Mrs. Grossman was born in Brooklyn and attended New York University. When she founded Zebra Books with Mr. Zacharius in 1975, she became, at the age of 29, the youngest president of a paperback house. Over the next decade, she expanded the company's range of titles from historical romances to both paperback and hard-cover novels and general nonfiction. Authors published by the company, with whom Mrs. Grossman worked closely, included Jerzy Kosinski, Isaac Asimov and Joyce Carol Oates. In 1988, Zebra acquired Pinnacle Books, and Mrs. Grossman took on its presidency as well.         She is survived by her husband, Robin, and a daughter, Shoshanna.       
         Roberta Laidlaw Forbes, the former wife of the late Malcolm S. Forbes, the publisher, died on Wednesday at her home in Bedminster, N.J. She was 67 years old.         An announcement from Forbes Inc. in New York said she died of lung cancer.         Mrs. Forbes, a native of Englewood, N.J., graduated from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and attended the New York School of Interior Design. She was active in local charities in New Jersey, including the Red Cross, and for many years managed Forbes ranch properties in Wyoming and Montana.         She was the daughter of Robert Remsen Laidlaw, managing partner of the former brokerage firm of Laidlaw & Company. She and Mr. Forbes divorced in 1985 after 39 years of marriage. Mr. Forbes died two years ago at the age of 70.         Mrs. Forbes is survived by four sons, Malcolm S. Jr., of Bedminster, Robert L., of Manhattan, Christopher, of Far Hills, N.J., and Timothy C., of Manhattan; a daughter, Moira Mumma of Chester Springs, Pa., and nine grandchildren.       
         Anita Colby, perhaps the nation's first "supermodel" and known as "The Face" after her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, died yesterday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 77 years old.         Miss Colby died of lung disease, her sister, Francine Okie of East Greenwich, R.I., said.         Although her career was launched and revolved around her widely acclaimed beauty, Miss Colby became an author, a newspaper columnist, an advertising executive, chief assistant to Hollywood moguls and a host on the "Today" show -- as well as a model and film actress.         Born Anita Counihan in Washington, on Aug. 5, 1914, Miss Colby was the eldest daughter of Bud Counihan, a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. A Stunning $100 an Hour         At the age of 19, Ms. Colby moved to New York and soon became the nation's most famous and highest-paid model, working for the John Powers agency. With her willowy, ash-blonde beauty, she was the first model ever to receive $100 an hour -- a stunning figure in those days -- and she once appeared on the covers of 15 magazines in a single month, including Time.         "She was the first great model," Miss Colby's longtime friend, Frances Koltun, said yesterday. "She was an extraordinarly stylish woman, and I hate to use that word because it sounds superficial, but she had exquisite taste."         Realizing that she had chosen a short-lived career, Miss Colby moved to Hollywood after only one year as a model and, while on contract with R.K.O., appeared in nine movies, including "Mary Queen of Scots" and "Brute Force." A New Career         But her reviews were hardly raves, and Miss Colby returned to New York in the early 1940's to take a position selling advertising for Harper's Bazaar. A column about her in The Herald Tribune on Jan. 4, 1950, written by Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg, said, "Her contract called for a salary of $55 a week, plus -- and that proved to be a big plus -- 10 percent of all the advertising she brought into the magazine." Miss Colby's sister, Francine, said yesterday, "She sold more advertising than all of them."         To her friends, according to the Herald Tribune column, she said: " 'If I ever go to Hollywood again, I'll tell those stars what to do.' And she did."         In 1944, Miss Colby was hired by David O. Selznick as his studio's "feminine director." Ms. Falkenburg, who became a close friend of Miss Colby, said yesterday: "She was in charge of coordinating all of these stars of the Selznick stable, on screen and off. She decided how they should be photographed, how they would dress, how public they should become, what interviews they should do. She was the den mother for the top beauties in America." Turned Down Clark Gable         And in the process, Miss Colby became friends with Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and others. She also turned down marriage proposals from Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, but let them down easy. "I introduced them to their wives," she told a reporter in 1970 on the occasion of her first and only marriage, to Palen Flagler, a business executive. Mr. Flagler died in 1980.         In 1947, after working for the Selznick organization, Miss Colby served as a $150,000-a-year executive assistant to the head of Paramount Pictures. She later started a public relations company in New York, wrote "Anita Colby's Beauty Book," bought and sold the Women's News Service, for which she wrote a syndicated newspaper column called "Anita Says," and appeared for six months on the "Today" show with Dave Garroway. There he hired Barbara Walters to write her scripts.         Miss Colby is survived by her sister.       
         Mary Osborne, one of the few women to gain jazz stardom as a guitarist and the first woman to play the electric guitar professionally, died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70 years old.         She died of liver failure as a result of cancer, said her son Ralph Scaffidi Jr.         Both her parents were guitarists, and Ms. Osborne -- whose family name was Orsborn -- became fascinated by stringed instruments as a child. She began playing the ukulele when she was 4 and at 10 she joined a string band led by her father in which she played banjo. She had started playing guitar a year earlier, and while she was in grammar school she was playing jazz violin. 'The Most Startling Thing'         She sang and played guitar in her hometown, Bismarck, N.D., in her teen-age years. When she was 17 some fellow musicians urged her to hear the Al Trent Sextet, which was playing a one-night stand in Bismark. One musician played an instrument she had never seen or heard before: an electric guitar. The guitarist was Charlie Christian.         "The only electric guitar I knew of was the Hawaiian guitar," she said. "I'd listen to all the jazz guitarists of the time, but they all played acoustic. But here was Charlie Christian playing Django Reinhardt's 'St. Louis Blues' note for note but with an electric guitar. It was the most startling thing I'd ever heard."         The next day, she found a guitar like Christian's. It cost $85; for $45, a friend built an amplifier for her. From then on, she was an electric guitarist.         She went on the road with an all-female trio. When they played St. Louis, Buddy Rogers, the movie star-turned-band leader, heard them and added them to his band. The Rogers band broke up when it reached New York, but Ms. Osborne quickly got jobs at radio stations and recording studios and joined in jam sessions in clubs on West 52d Street. She eventually formed her own trio.         With her husband, Ralph Scaffidi, a trumpet player, she moved to Bakersfield in 1968 where they formed and ran the Osborne Guitar Company, which later became the Osborne Sound Laboratories, a manufacturer of amplifiers and public-address systems. She appeared at the Kool Jazz Festival in New York in 1981 and played at the Village Vanguard two years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Bakersfield, she is survived by her husband, another son, Peter, of Clovis, N.M.; a daughter, Susan Chidgey of Bakersfield; a brother, Elvy Orsborn, and a sister, Louise Orsborn.       
         Margaret T. Barker, an actress and director who was an original member of the Group Theater, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had homes in New York City and Fairfield, Conn.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Miss Barker was born in Baltimore, where her father was a prominent doctor. She attended Bryn Mawr College, where a fellow actor in student productions was Katharine Hepburn, and began her career in 1928 as the flirtatious Alice Fordyce in the Broadway production of "The Age of Innocence," which starred Katharine Cornell. Three years later, she appeared as Henrietta in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" with Miss Cornell. She left that production to join the Group Theater, taking major roles in "The House of Connelly," "Men in White" and Clifford Odets's "Till the Day I Die." In 1937, when the Group Theater split into warring factions, she was dismissed.         In addition to many Broadway appearances in the 1940's and 50's, including roles in the original productions of Lillian Hellman's "Autumn Garden" and Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding," she performed with the Williamstown Summer Theater in Massachusetts for 10 years and was a member of the Circle Repertory Company in New York. She also directed, produced and performed in Off Broadway plays, regional theaters, television and film.         Her companion was Ann Macfarlane.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Quaintance Eaton, a writer of books and articles on opera, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She died of complications of a stroke, said Bill Cunningham, a longtime friend.         Miss Eaton was born in Kansas City, Mo.,and became a devotee of opera long before moving to New York City in the 1920's. She frequently wrote on the subject for Musical America, eventually becoming an associate editor, and was a contributing editor to Opera News.         In 1957, her book "Opera Caravan," an anecdotal history of the Metropolitan Opera on tour, was praised by Howard Taubman, then chief music critic of The New York Times, as "both diverting and informative."         In the 1960's, she published two histories that have become standard works: "The Boston Opera Company" (1965) and "The Miracle of the Met" (1968). She was also executive secretary of the National Federation of Music Clubs and of the New York City Opera Guild.         Her last book, published in 1987, was "Sutherland and Bonynge: An Intimate Biography," about Dame Joan Sutherland and her husband, the conductor Richard Bonynge.         Miss Eaton was known among opera audiences for the chinchilla coat she wore and for her collection of stylish hats, said to number 250.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Louise Speers Croix, a chemist who worked on anesthetics, died on Monday at the King James Care Center in Chatham Township, N.J. She was 72 years old and lived in Summit, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said a friend, Walter Mac Williams of Bernardsville.         Dr. Croix was born in Nanking, China, where her Presbyterian-missionary parents taught at the university. She graduated from Vassar College in 1940 with a chemistry major and earned her Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University in 1949.         She started a 35-year-career in 1949 with the Ohio Chemical and Surgical Division of the Air Reduction Company. Working in its laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., she specialized in anesthetics and related products. She retired in 1984. The company now is the Airco Gases Division of Britain's BOC Group.         She is survived by her brother, James Speers of Pensacola, Fla., and a sister, Elizabeth Bagley of Rock Hill, S.C.       
         Sara Chisholm Farrington, a writer and a pioneer in international big-game fishing, died Thursday at Southhampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 84 years old.         She died of pneumonia after suffering a stroke, her family said.         Brought up in Manhattan and Long Island, she went to the Spence and Farmington schools. In 1934, she married a noted outdoorsman and author, Selwyn Kip Farrington Jr.         Mrs. Farrington, under the pen name of Chisie Farrington and as an internationally known angler with seven world records to her credit, wrote "Women Can Fish" in 1951. The book chronicled her experiences accompanying her husband on fishing trips around the world. "Women Can Fish," as well as the fishing articles she wrote in the 1930's and 40's for Harpers Bazaar, Vogue and Mademoiselle, helped to establish women as sporting participants in their own right.         The Farringtons traveled in a circle of big-game adventurers who included Ernest Hemingway and Alfred Glassell. In their company, Sara Farrington was an angler among equals: The 674-pound tuna she caught off Watch Hill, R.I., in the mid-1950's was first tuna that had ever been caught in those fishing grounds by man or woman.         She is survived by a grandniece, Patricia McCain, and a grandnephew, Charles Madeira.       
         Molly Picon, the comedic actress and singer who lightened and brightened the often dolorous themes of Yiddish theater with shows that were sprightly operettas, died yesterday in Lancaster, Pa. She was 94 years old.         She died in her sleep at the home of her sister, Helen Silverblatt, said Seymour Rexite, president of the Hebrew Actors Union.         Miss Picon, who was an indefatigable performer well into her 80's, had a stage career that dated from first efforts when she was 5 years old. With her sparkling         ganayvishe oygen,         or mischievous eyes, and her sturdy delivery of Yiddish songs with appropriate gestures and intonation, she reigned supreme in more than 200 productions along the Yiddish theater row that was lower Second Avenue during the 1920's.         She also appeared on Broadway, achieving her most notable success in a two-season run of "Milk and Honey," a hit musical that opened in 1961, when she was in her mid-60's. When she co-starred with Robert Morley in a London production of "A Majority of One," she was acclaimed by critics.         But it was in Yiddish theater, where audiences often measured their enjoyment by the volume of tears on both sides of the footlights, that Miss Picon established an international reputation by playing for laughs. An Idol in Jewish Neighborhoods         To millions of Jews in major cities of the United States, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia, "our Molly" meant the slender, vivacious comedian with the dark, dancing eyes and elfin face whose songs, dances and mimicry provided hilarious joy. Among the songs she helped turn into hits were "The Story of Grandma's Shawl" and "The Working Goil." She was idolized in Jewish neighborhoods, where children and clubs were named after her during her heyday in the 1920's.         Hers was the expansive, emotional style that would have been restricted by the colder performances tailored to the realism of Broadway. When she performed her first English-speaking starring role, in 1940 in Sylvia Regan's drama "Morning Star," Brooks Atkinson, who did not care for the show itself, wrote about Miss Picon in The New York Times, "To coin a phrase, she is a darling."         This was the universal sentiment that she aroused in critics and audiences alike with her talent for generating warmth and rapport. Miss Picon loved the uninhibited audiences of the Yiddish theater.         She had a flair that averted staleness and repetition. On the Yiddish stage, she used Broadway dance routines as much as possible and flooded the dialogue with English. Jacob Kalich, her husband and colleague from 1919 until his death in 1975, wrote more than 40 scripts for her, and Joseph Rumshinsky, the well-known composer, did most of her music. Mr. Kalich wrote for her one of her most sustained presentations, the play "Yankele," a sort of Yiddish Peter Pan story in which she portrayed a little boy. She later said she had appeared in it 3,000 times, a figure that might be taken merely to mean that it went on quite often. Her Yiddish Was Acquired         Curiously, Miss Picon had to develop her knowledge of Yiddish. She was born on Broome Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, on June 1, 1898, to an immigrant couple. They moved to Philadelphia when she was a child, a migration that made her English sound a bit alien in later years to Jews with the accent of East Side New York.         At the age of 5, Miss Picon won a teddy bear in a burlesque-house amateur program. Her mother recognized her talent and encouraged her, and young Molly started singing for 50 cents a night.         At age 15 she joined a Yiddish repertory company and toured as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," switching languages -- English or Yiddish -- to suit the ears of the audience. Because she thought of a future in English-language theater, Miss Picon drifted into the cross-country vaudeville circuits, where she perfected her timing and her uncanny instinct for audience response. Made a Film With Sinatra         Her career changed suddenly when her vaudeville troupe was stranded in Boston. There Mr. Kalich persuaded her to join the Yiddish company he managed. After their marriage she went with him, in 1919, to Eastern Europe, where she perfected her Yiddish. Upon their return in 1923, she made her stage debut as the star of "Yankele."         In more recent decades, Miss Picon did less Yiddish theater, of which there was less to do. After "Milk and Honey" she worked mostly in English-language undertakings, in such plays as "Paris Is Out" in 1970 and "Something Old, Something New" (later called "The Second Time Around") in 1977 with Hans Conried. She appeared in the films "Come Blow Your Horn," which starred Frank Sinatra, and "For Pete's Sake," with Barbra Streisand.         In 1959, after an interval of many years, she returned to Second Avenue to star in a Yiddish vehicle, "The Kosher Widow." She wrote the lyrics to the music by Sholom Secunda, and the book was by Mr. Kalich and Louis Freiman. She had two roles in it, and the audience determined the story's outcome with an applause meter.         Miss Picon was particularly touched in 1946 when she and her husband were among the first entertainers to visit European camps for displaced people.         As she recalled in an interview years after the visit, "A woman came up with a child and said, 'My child is 2 years old and she has never heard the sound of laughter.' "         Her husband told Miss Picon: "Molly, that's our job. Make them laugh!"         In 1960, "Molly!," an autobiography written with Jean Bergantini Grillo, was published by Simon & Schuster.         Miss Picon is survived by her sister.         Correction:  April 8, 1992, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about the actress and singer Molly Picon misstated the publication date of her autobiography, "Molly!" It was 1980.       
         Janet Wolf Levy, a patron of the arts, died yesterday at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan and Armonk, N.Y.         Mrs. Levy died of lung cancer, her family said.         She was named by Mayor David N. Dinkins earlier this month as one of several recipients of the annual Mayor's Very Special Arts Awards for promoting the arts for people with disabilities.         She was the chairwoman of Creative Alternatives, a drama therapy program at the Mount Sinai Medical Center.         Mrs. Levy became a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs & Company in 1976 at the death of her husband of 42 years, Gustave L. Levy. Mr. Levy was the head of Goldman, Sachs, a leading international investment banking firm, and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.         Ms. Levy, who was born in Huntington, W.Va., grew up in Baltimore. She attended college and art school.         She is survived by her son, Peter, of Manhattan; a daughter, Betty Hess, of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Lydia Joel, the former editor in chief of Dance Magazine and head of the dance department at the School of Performing Arts, died on Sunday at New York Hospital She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, said her husband, Edwin Miller.         As teacher and journalist, Miss Joel helped to increase appreciation of dance as an art and to raise standards of dance writing and training. Appointed editor in chief of Dance Magazine in 1952, she began to emphasize serious criticism, essays, photographic features and foreign reports. As a result, a publication that had previously been read largely by performers and teachers came to appeal to the general dance audience.         Through her early teaching activities in Texas, she acknowledged the importance of fostering dance across America. And at the School of Performing Arts in New York, she supervised a program that prepared young people for professional careers.  Studied Two Methods         Miss Joel, whose maiden name was Tarnower, was born in New York City. She received a bachelor's degree in English from New York University and did additional graduate work at Cornell University. She studied ballet at the School of American Ballet and modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and Hanya Holm, two leaders of the German modern dance that flourished before World War II. She also attended summer sessions of the Bennington (Vt.) School of Dance, the forerunner of today's American Dance Festival.         At Bennington in 1937, Miss Joel danced in the premiere of "Trend," Miss Holm's monumentally scaled depiction of social conflicts. In New York that same year, Miss Joel appeared in Max Reinhardt's production of "The Eternal Road."         She taught in 1938 at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and from 1938 to 1944 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she headed her own company.         Her first husband was the conductor Gerhard Joel; he died in 1946 but she retained Joel as her professional name. She married Mr. Miller, the entertainment editor of Seventeen magazine, in 1953.         Miss Joel joined the staff of Dance Magazine in 1947, working in the editorial and advertising departments. When she left the publication in 1969, the staff, under her guidance, had grown from 4 to 15 people.         Miss Joel directed the dance department of the School of Performing Arts from 1973 until her retirement in 1984, producing the high school's annual concerts and arranging a performance by 12 of its students at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982.         She served on the board of directors of the American College Dance Festival, the Association of American Dance Companies and the National Association for Regional Ballet, and contributed articles to Vogue, Parents Magazine and other publications. In recent years, she lectured and wrote about Catherine de' Medici, the Renaissance monarch who influenced the development of ballet in European courts.         In addition to her husband, Miss Joel is survived by a son, Eric Miller of Manhattan, and three brothers, Irving Tarnower of Teaneck, N.J., Dr. William Tarnower of Topeka, Kans., and Gerald Tarnower of Dallas.

         Margaretha Ley, chief designer and co-founder of Escada AG, the German women's apparel company known for colorful, highly decorated sportswear, died last Thursday in Munich after a long illness.         Mrs. Ley lived in Munich. The company would not disclose her age or cause of death, but she underwent intestinal surgery in recent months.         Mrs. Ley and her husband, Wolfgang Ley, founded Escada in 1979 and built it into an international company that had sales topping $800 million last year. They took the name Escada, which means staircase in Portuguese, from a racehorse, believing it boded well for their future. There are 140 Escada boutiques around the world, including a six-story shop that opened on 57th Street in New York last November. The clothes are also sold in 1,200 specialty and department stores around the world.

In recent years, Mrs. Ley directed a team of designers who turned out 1,200 styles each season under the Escada label alone. The clothes are divided into color groups, with coordinating shoes, scarfs, gloves and jewelry. New merchandise is shipped to stores every two weeks. Prices are in the upper bracket, with jackets averaging $1,000.         Born in Sweden, Mrs. Ley worked as a model in Stockholm, Vienna and Paris before turning to design. She designed for Mondi, a German sportswear manufacturer, for 10 years before founding Escada with her husband, whom she had married in 1974.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Sven Ley, of Munich, and two children from a previous marriage, Karin Srb, of Munich, and Kristian Srb, of Water Mill, N.Y.       
         Tiki Freeman, who in the early 1970's became one of the first female cantors in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Eastchester, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         Mrs. Freeman died of cancer, said her husband, Joel.         Mrs. Freeman was born in Brooklyn, to Elias Gilner, one of the founders of the Haganah, the defense force raised by Palestinian Jews during the British Mandate, and Violet Sandheim, who had been private secretary to Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization.         Mrs. Freeman's family emigrated to Palestine in the mid-1930's, returning in 1941 as war began to sweep over the area.         Mrs. Freeman graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947. While raising a family, she built a singing career and her repertory ranged from operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan to folk songs and religious music. She was also a stage manager for many productions of Gilbert & Sullivan and other light operas for the Westchester Music Conservatory Opera Company.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Gail Weed Westcott, of Simsbury, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Yonkers, and Ethan, of London and Vienna; a brother, Rabbi Herbert Gilner of Chambersburg, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Hope Miller Lessman, a former actress and real estate executive, died on July 25 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lance.         As Hope Miller, Mrs. Lessman appeared in numerous dramas on film, the Broadway stage, and in television between 1940 and 1954. Her credits included the live television drama "This Thing Called Love" with Ralph Bellamy in 1948; the 1950 Broadway play "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" with Fredric March, and the 1954 live television drama "The Wages of Fear," with Louis Jourdan.         In 1953 Mrs. Lessman married Herbert L. Miskend, the president of a New York-based apparel company, and retired from acting. When Mr. Miskend died in 1962, Mrs. Lessman became president of Dural Realty Corporation, a company Mr. Miskend had owned, and she managed several buildings on a portion of the site now occupied by the Continental Illinois Building at Madison Avenue and 53d Street in Manhattan. She held that post until 1969, when she sold her property there.         Mrs. Lessman married Jac Lessman, a hotel and resort developer, in 1965. He died in 1990.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Henry. Both are from Manhattan.       
         Ruth Batchelor, a songwriter and radio and television reporter, died on July 23 at South Miami Hospital in Florida. She was 58 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Peter Kory.         Ms. Batchelor began her career as a songwriter, writing songs for Elvis Presley. She also wrote several musicals, including a version of "Tom Jones" for CBS-TV. In 1971, she released an album of women's liberation songs called "Reviving a Dream" on Femme Records, a company she began.         Ms. Batchelor founded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association in 1975, and was its president and executive director for three years. She was an entertainment reporter for ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and a film critic for National Public Radio.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Douglas, of Covelo, Calif.; her parents, Lil and Albert Tarshis of Las Vegas, Nev.; a sister, Lolo Berkoff, and a brother, Stanley Gordon, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
         Pola Nirenska, a noted teacher and choreographer who danced with Mary Wigman, died on Saturday after a fall from the balcony of her apartment in Bethesda, Md. She was 81 years old.         The death was ruled a suicide by the Montgomery County Medical Examiner.         Miss Nirenska was a major force in dance in Washington, as a teacher, as director of a company whose dancers included Liz Lerman and Sharon Wyrrick (later choreographers in their own right), and as a creator of impressively fashioned dances filled with often raw emotion. Her last piece, presented at Dance Place in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims she had known and was called "In Memory of Those I Loved . . . Who Are No More."  Little Early Training         "Her dances are strong and stark, like massive three-dimensional sculpture in volume and weight," George Jackson, a Washington-based dance critic, said after Miss Nirenska's death. "Her figures are larger than life, but with very distinct personalities."         Miss Nirenska, who was born in Warsaw, insisted on a dance career as a child. She had very little early training, but graduated with honors from a music and dance school in Dresden, Germany, run by Wigman, the influential German Expressionist choreographer. Miss Nirenska performed with Wigman's company during its 1932-33 tour of the United States and Germany. She then embarked on a career as a solo dancer, teacher and choreographer, working in Warsaw, Vienna and Italy. In 1934 the International Dance Congress in Vienna awarded Miss Nirenska a first prize for choreography and a second prize for performing.         At the start of World War II, Miss Nirenska, who was Jewish, immigrated to England, where she gave solo recitals, choreographed musicals and entertained the troops. She also worked there with the choreographers Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder and modeled for the sculptor Jacob Epstein.         Miss Nirenska left for the United States in 1949. She studied in New York with leading American modern-dance choreographers and teachers, among them Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon and Louis Horst. She moved to Washington in 1951 and established a career there as a teacher at local ballet and modern-dance schools and at her own studio, and as a highly regarded choreographer with a company of her own.         Her marriage to Count John Ledesma, an actor and military pilot, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Jan Karski.       
         Willa L. Z. Armstrong, the president of Armstrong Information Services, a Manhattan video-production company, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center. She was 63 years old and had homes in Manhattan and at Ocean Ridge on Fire Island, L.I.         She died of cancer, said a friend, Helen L. Horwitz.         Mrs. Armstrong won many industry awards for her films, which included a range of educational and informational videos, public-service announcements and video-news releases. Several of her productions, including "Screen Printing: An American Art Form" and "Drive to Win," about four-in-hand equestrian driving, were broadcast on public television.         She was born in Manhattan and reared in Brooklyn. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College. Before founding her company in 1979, she was a vice president of Planned Communications Services, a corporate-video production company. She was a member of Women Executives in Public Relations and New York Women in Film.         She is survived by a brother, Walter Zanger of Jerusalem, and a stepson, Grattan V. Armstrong of East Hampton, L.I.       
         Alberta Smith Jacoby, a film maker and lecturer on mental health, died on Wednesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jacoby, a specialist in mental-health education, had been a member of the faculty of Yale University for the last 25 years and remained a lecturer on public health at the time of her death. She taught and produced documentaries at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, a part of the Yale School of Medicine.         She was born in Worthington, Minn., was an alternate on the 1928 Olympic diving team and became a champion golfer. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota and received a master's degree in public health from Yale in 1967, the year she joined the faculty.         She began to show films on health during World War II as a program director for the Office of War Information, an information officer at the Public Health Service and, finally, chief of information for the National Institute of Mental Health.         She went into film making herself in 1949, when she and her director-husband, the late Irving A. Jacoby, formed the Mental Health Film Board. A production company, it made more than 100 documentaries, some of which won awards, on subjects such as psychiatric illnesses, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and hospice care.         At Yale, she taught a course entitled Health Communications. With her assistance, student crews made films about local health agencies to educate the public about what the agencies did.         Mr. Jacoby died in 1985. She is survived by six children, Clair Haycraft Johnson of Maui, Hawaii, Sara Haycraft Sparrow of North Branford, Conn., Peter Altman of Boston, Leslie Altman Rescoria of Havertown, Pa., Tamar Jacoby of Manhattan, and Oren Jacoby, also of Manhattan; three brothers, Paul Smith of St. David's Island, Bermuda, and Robert and Sidney Smith, both of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Rodgers, a writer, interior decorator and inventor and the widow of the composer Richard Rodgers, died at her home in Manhattan yesterday. She was 83 years old.         She died of emphysema, said her daughters, Mary Rodgers Guettel of Manhattan and Linda Rodgers Emory of Katonah, N.Y.         Mrs. Rodgers, whose maiden name was Feiner, was born in New York City. She attended the Horace Mann School and studied art and interior design at Wellesley College from 1926 to 1928. In 1930 she married Mr. Rodgers, who collaborated with the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d on musicals including "Oklahoma!," "South Pacific," "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music." Mr. Rodgers died in 1979.         Mrs. Rodgers founded Repairs Inc., an agency that hired craftsmen to repair broken objects, in 1935 and was its head until 1941. In 1945 she patented the Jonny Mop, which was sold by Johnson & Johnson. It was one of several inventions. In 1958 she created the Basically Yours dress pattern for McCall's, and in 1972 she patented the Turn and Learn storybooks, sold by the Ideal Toy Company. Books for Home and Family         Mrs. Rodgers wrote several books on home design and entertaining, including "My Favorite Things" (1964) and "The House in My Head" (1967). With her daughter Mary, she wrote "A Word to the Wives" (1970), which offered advice on mother-daughter relations. The book led to a nationally syndicated radio program in 1971 and 1972 and a monthly column for McCall's magazine called "Of Two Minds," which ran from 1971 to 1979.         Mrs. Rodgers was an officer of many charitable and arts organizations, including the Authors League of America, the American Institute of Interior Designers, the Public Education Association, the Museum of Modern Art, the American Red Cross, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Jewish Museum.         In addition to her daughters, she is survived by six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Hope Yandell Hanes, who bred and raced champion horses, died yesterday at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 86 years old.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Hanes started racing horses in the 1930's. Her husband, John Wesley Hanes Sr., joined in the venture, and they owned many stakes winners in England, Ireland and the United States. They were involved in the syndication of Nashua, Royal Charger and My Babu.         She was also a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and was an amateur painter, sculptor and writer.         Born in Danville, Ky., Mrs. Hanes grew up there and in Greenwich, Conn. She was educated at Bryn Mawr College, where she formed a lifelong friendship with her roommate, Katharine Hepburn.         She was married for 55 years to Mr. Hanes, who died in 1987. He was an Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Roosevelt Administration, the head of the New York Racing Association and a part owner in the company that made Hanes hosiery and underwear.         Mrs. Hanes is survived by their daughter, Susan H. Caldwell of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, June H. McKnight of Norwich, Vt., and Ormsby H. Matthiessen of Old Lyme, Conn.; a stepson, John W. Hanes Jr. of Alexandria, Va.; a brother, Lunsford P. Yandell of Scottsdale, Ariz.; 16 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Jean T. Chorley, a former professional singer and a civic leader, died on Saturday at her home in Skillman, N.J. She was 88 years old.         She had a history of heart disease and died in her sleep, her family said.         From 1934-41 she sang professionally as a mezzo-soprano under the stage name of Jean Travers. She performed at Radio City Music Hall, with the St. Louis Opera Company, on the Rudy Vallee and Chase & Sanborn radio shows and in concerts nationally and in Canada and Europe.         She was born Jeanette Baumohl in Manhattan. Her first husband, Morris Treistman, died in 1937. She remarried in 1941, to Kenneth Chorley.         Mr. Chorley, a close associate of Laurance S. and John D. Rockefeller Jr., served for 23 years as president of the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project and was an officer of several nonprofit organizations.         During that period, Mrs. Chorley and her husband entertained foreign officials and royalty. In the 1950's they restored an old brick farmhouse in Hopewell, N.J., and filled it with 18th-century antiques and English pottery. Mr. Chorley died in 1974.         Mrs. Chorley served as the board president of the Old Barracks Association, an American Revolution historical organization in Trenton, and also coached the lay readers at the Trinity Episcopalian Church in Princeton.         Surviving are a stepson, Edward C. Chorley of White Plains, 5 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Marie Paxton, an actress who appeared in many Broadway plays, died on Aug. 16 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center after a brief illness. She lived in New York City.         Her family would not give her age or the cause of death.         Miss Paxton was born in London, the daughter of the English actor Sydney Paxton and a descendant of five generations of actors. She began acting as a child, and first appeared in the United States in "Pickwick" in 1927 and "Napoleon" in 1928.         Miss Paxton moved to New York in the early 1940's and appeared in such Broadway productions as "The Three Sisters" with Katharine Cornell and Judith Anderson, "The Chalk Garden" with Gladys Cooper, "O Mistress Mine" with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and "Hadrian VII" with Alec McCowan.         Her last appearance on Broadway was as Lady Brockhurst in the 1970 revival of "The Boy Friend" with Sandy Duncan. Miss Paxton was Mrs. Higgins in the first national company of "My Fair Lady," and played that role more than 3,000 times in various productions.         She is survived by a niece, Patricia Paxton Jordan, of London.       
         Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, the director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, died on Sept. 3 at the institute, where she lived. She was 63 years old.         She died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes, the institute said.         Sister Scaglione had worked as an educator since joining the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order, in 1947.         The order operates Grace Institute, which was founded by William Russell Grace and is now headed by his grandson, J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company.         The institute provides free occupational training, mostly for secretarial work, and other adult education, including nutrition, cooking and clothing classes, for women. It enrolls about 1,000 students a year.         As the director, Sister Scaglione helped adapt the institute's program to the changing needs of the city's minority and immigrant women. She introduced new courses, including English as second language, and added night sessions and classes in the Bronx.         Before working at Grace, Sister Joseph taught at St. Raymond's Academy and Spellman High School in the Bronx and was the director of St. Joseph's Academy in Greenwich Village.         A native of New Jersey, she grew up in Manhattan and Queens. After graduating from the College of Mount St. Vincent, she earned a master's degree in business education from the College of St. Rose.         Surviving are a brother and sister, Jack and Rosalie Scaglione, both of Queens.         Correction:  September 26, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Sept. 12 on Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, misidentified her Roman Catholic order. The order, which runs the institute, is the Sisters of Charity, not the Sisters of Mercy.       
         Clara Rotter, for many years secretary of The New York Times drama department and a well-known figure in Broadway circles, died on Sunday at her home in Woodside, Queens. She was 82 years old.         She died after a long illness, said her brother Alex, of Queens.         Miss Rotter served as the conduit between the newspaper's critics and those involved in productions. Producers, writers, directors and, of course, press agents knew her well. They also knew her role as intermediary between them and the critics, whom she shielded, as they wanted, from pleadings and promotions. Such was her reputation that a question once put to applicants who wanted to join the theater press agents' union was "Who is Clara Rotter?"         Though frail and diminutive, Miss Rotter had a strong will and a determination to accomplish any chore to ease the paths of critics and reporters.         Brooks Atkinson, the Times drama critic when she came to the department, once sent off a letter and then remarked that he wished he hadn't written it. Miss Rotter worked her way by telephone through the post office hierarchy and was assured that retrieval was impossible. She persisted and learned the home telephone number of the top man. When she called, she was told he was dining at a restaurant. She telephoned him there and, according to colleagues at The Times, the letter was withdrawn. A Friend of the Famous         During her time in the drama department, which began shortly after she joined The Times in 1945, Miss Rotter made many friendships with the famous on Broadway and its auxiliary fields. Her correspondence with the playwright Sean O'Casey resulted in a flood of letters that in themselves constituted a literary legacy now included in the Billy Rose Theater Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.         During most of her secretarial career, Miss Rotter worked with Mr. Atkinson. When he died in 1984 after retiring from The Times in 1965, he left her $2,500, which she donated to the Brooks Atkinson Memorial Playwright Exchange of New Dramatists to assist talented young playwrights.         Miss Rotter served with several later critics before retiring at the age of 70. For several years she continued to act as liaison in the purchase of theater tickets for the parent New York Times Company.         In addition to her brother Alex, she is survived by another brother, Leonard, of Syosset, L.I.       
         Elizabeth Meusebach Carrington, who did volunteer work for a variety of charitable organizations, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 77 years old.         She died of cancer of the esophagus, said a daughter, Judith C. Green of Manhattan.         At the time of her death Mrs. Carrington was on the board of the Youth Counseling League, which aids troubled children. Earlier she was its president for seven years, a vice president of the New York Junior League and a member of the auxiliary board of the New York Philharmonic.         A native of St. Louis, she was married in 1934 to John C. Carrington, who became an executive vice president of The Freeport Minerals Company and the president of the Hewitt School's board of trustees. He died in 1979.         She is also survived by her daughter Elizabeth C. Bierman of Manhattan and four grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Carol Weil Haussamen, a New York City philanthropist, hostess and Democratic fund-raiser, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer of the esophagus.         Mrs. Haussamen, a real-estate heiress, was born in Manhattan, the daughter of L. Victor Weil, a real-estate executive, and the former Beatrice Schwab. She attended private schools, including the Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, acquired fluency in French from her governesses and traveled extensively when her mother showed horses. In those years the family also kept an estate in Elberon, N.J., where she spent her summers. Hostess to Ambassadors         From her father she inherited, among other properties, a building on Central Park South, and with it a palatial 20th-floor, 18-room apartment. For the last 25 years or more her home served as a fountainhead of funds for Democratic candidates from around the country.         She served as hostess for foreign ambassadors during the 1976 national convention, and she often entertained other visiting foreign dignitaries as well. She played a role in every subsequent campaign, though her family said that in this Presidential election year she had to curtail her activities somewhat because of her health.         She was the president of the nonprofit Carol W. Haussamen and Carolyndale Foundations, which she dedicated to the rehabilitation of housing for the poor. She also headed Forty Central Park South Inc., a company that owns and manages apartment buildings.         She served in various capacities on the Governor's Committee on Scholastic Achievement, Just One Break Inc., Manhattan Industrial Home for the Blind, Community Board No. 5, First Women's Bank of New York, Urban Design Council, Citizens Housing and Planning Council, Association for a Better New York, Mayor's Midtown Committee and Roosevelt Island Development Corporation.         Her marriages to Crane Haussamen and Monroe Hemmerdinger ended in divorce.         Mrs. Haussamen is survived by a son, Dale Hemmerdinger of Manhattan; a daughter, Lyn Hemmerdinger of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.       
         Hanya Holm, a major choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 99 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said Heidi Holm, her daughter-in-law.         To theatergoers, Miss Holm was known as the choreographer of musicals including Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Out of This World" and Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot." To modern-dance aficionados, Miss Holm was the most significant choreographer and dancer to have come out of the Central European Expressionist dance tradition in Germany. Its most noted figure was Mary Wigman, and Miss Holm was her student. Her 1937 "Trend," a dance of social protest, is considered a masterwork of American modern dance. Miss Holm has been considered a member of a pantheon of American modern-dance choreographers that included Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman.         A funny, humane and uncompromising woman, Miss Holm encouraged her pupils to find their own individual ways of artistic expression. Her students included leading choreographers as diverse as Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, Glen Tetley, Don Redlich and Lucinda Childs. Sound and Movement         Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes. She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915. The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman. Miss Holm was dancing with Wigman's troupe by 1921 and taught in her school in Dresden. She remained a leading Wigman teacher and dancer for 10 years, creating roles in "Feier" and "Totenmal," which she helped Wigman choreograph. It was during this time that she changed her name.         In 1930-31, Sol Hurok brought the Wigman company to the United States for a transcontinental tour. Hurok had urged Wigman to found an American school, and she agreed, sending Miss Holm to America to direct it. Miss Holm arrived in New York City in September 1931, and for the next five years she devoted herself to teaching. She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance. The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective." The distinction, she added, was "one of 'being' as contrasted with 'doing.' "         Miss Holm took on other teaching positions in important dance institutions, among them, in 1934, the Bennington College Summer School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival, where the "Trend" was first performed. In 1941, she developed the influential summer dance program at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, where she continued to teach until 1983. Part of the success of her teaching lay in her pithy instructions to students. "Keep the beat," she told them, "but undermine it." Another instruction was to "use the feet as if you would pick up a flower with your toes." Her students were familiar with the command to "feel it, children, don't schlep it." 'Living Essence'         She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching. "If I see one more leg extension, I've had it," Miss Holm said in 1984. "There is security in a major leg extension. But it means nothing. The simplest thing is to shun the emotions and emphasize technique. But you become like a nice stove that doesn't give any heat." One had to be careful, she noted, of trying to instill that "little bit of living essence." "You can't take something away without         giving         something," she said.         She had begun choreographing in 1928, but her American concert career began in 1937 with a tour of Midwestern colleges. She made her New York debut that year in a program that included "Trend," her first major work in America, which had a cast of 33 dancers, some of them from her own company and the rest students at Bennington. A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp. Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.         John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering." He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen."         One of the best descriptions of Miss Holm's dances and of "Trend" came, however, in an observation made by the choreographer about Wigman's work. "In her dances she alternately grapples with space as an opponent and caresses it as though it were a living, sentient thing," Miss Holm said. "In her gestures and movement she carves boldly and delicately visible and fluid forms, shaping, surrounding and sinking in the space which presses close about her." Early TV, Then Broadway         Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary. In 1939, she also became the first concert dancer to present her work on television in the United States, showing a shortened version of "Metropolitan Daily," a humorous depiction of a daily newspaper.         Miss Holm had abandoned modern dance for the Broadway stage by 1947, although she continued to create dances for her summer students and choreographed four well-received dances for the Don Redlich Dance Company in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's. Her first success was with the 1948 "Ballet Ballads," a suite of dances she created with Katherine Litz and Paul Godkin to music composed by Jerome Moross, with lyrics by John Latouche.         As a result of the success of her dance, "The Eccentricities of Davy Crockett," Miss Holm was invited to choreograph "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948 and won a New York Drama Critics Award. Over the next 18 years, she created dances for 13 musicals becoming known for her ability to meet the stylistic needs of each show. In 1952, she became the first choreographer to copyright a dance: her choreography for "Kiss Me, Kate," submitted as a written Labanotation score on microfilm.         Among Miss Holm's other Broadway musicals were "Out of This World," "My Darlin' Aida" and "The Golden Apple." She also created the dances for the London and Tel Aviv productions of "My Fair Lady." She choreographed and directed the opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe" in 1956 in Central City, Colo., and Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" for the second annual Vancouver International Festival in 1959. Among her film and television assignments were the dances for the 1955 film version of "The Vagabond King." Miss Holm was also known for her essays, published in periodicals and books, on dance teaching and technique.         Her honors included an award from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for her contributions to modern dance in 1958, the Capezio Award, the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award in 1984 and the Astaire Award in 1987. "It just happened," Miss Holm said of her career in accepting the Scripps Award, "and whatever has happened was with love, dedication, good will, gladly and well. I keep on doing it as good as I can and as long as I can."         Miss Holm's marriage to Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a painter and sculptor, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Klaus, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and three granddaughters, Karen Trautlein of Wilkes-Barre, Angela Holm of San Diego and Jessica Werbin of New Haven, Conn.       
         Catharine A. Yard, president of the American Timber Company, died on Thursday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 48 years old and lived in Sea Girt.         Ms. Yard died of pneumonia, said Michael Cherenson, a family spokesman.         In 1990 Ms. Yard became president of American Timber, which was founded by her grandfather in 1893. Ms. Yard, who attended Yuba College in Marysville, Calif., and Chico State University in Chico, Calif., had worked for the company since 1968.         Ms. Yard is survived by a son, Michael Saito, and three daughters, Michelle, Mikiko and Mary Catherine Saito, and her mother, Dorothy, all of Sea Girt; two sisters, Elizabeth Rasmussen, of Chico, Calif., and Victoria Steiner, of Seattle; four brothers, William, of Modesto, Calif., Carl Jr., of Wall Township, N.J., Richard, of Jackson Township, N.J., and Stephen, of Oroville, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Margaret Hockaday LaFarge, a pioneer among women in the advertising industry whose saucy, irreverent ads shook up Madison Avenue, died on Friday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 85.         She died in her sleep of heart failure, said her niece, Susan Hockaday Jones.         Miss Hockaday, who used her maiden name professionally, was founder and president of Hockaday Associates, a New York agency with a reputation for whimsy and flair. The Hockaday ads were so inventive that they were frequently reported on in the general press and the trade magazines.         She made her first big splash in 1953 with Dunbar furniture, picturing sofas, armchairs and beds in treehouses, on city streets, in green fields -- everywhere but in their normal setting.         Then followed the Capezio campaign, starting in 1956, in which the shoe company was presented as a state of mind, with shoes not even mentioned in the ads for several years. Her "Capezio people" appeared everywhere; some critics complained that the ads did not picture the product, but they sold shoes.         Her most quoted slogans were for swimwear and Scotch: "Just wear a smile and a Jantzen," and, "As long as you're up, get me a Grant's."         Under her direction Hockaday Associates, which had started out in 1949 in a converted barber shop on 58th Street, moved to 575 Madison Avenue. Her list of accounts grew to include Fuller Fabrics, Crane stationery, Health-tex clothing for children, Elizabeth Arden, Reed & Barton silver, Royal Worcester Porcelain.         Her husband, L. Bancel LaFarge, an architect, died in 1989. Besides her niece, Susan, of Princeton, N.J., she is survived by two nephews, Peter Hockaday of San Francisco and John Hockaday of Alexandria, Va.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Marie McCarthy, who for many years designed the Larry Aldrich fashion collection, died on Tuesday at the Windermere Nursing Home in Virginia Beach, Va., at the age of 86.         She entered the home in 1989 because of severe osteoporosis, and her condition had deteriorated, said her daughter, Polly Gillespie.         Miss McCarthy, who was born in Cambridge, Mass., and attended Radcliffe College, started her career as a buyer for Filene's, the Boston department store. In New York in 1939, she became the designer for Larry Aldrich, a Seventh Avenue manufacturer known for simple, tasteful women's clothing.         She became a partner in the early 1970's and continued to design the line until the company closed in 1975.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Agnes Nessen, of Lincoln, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Callaghan Candaele St. Aubin, the speedy outfielder whose swing won one batting title and inspired two movies about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, died Tuesday night at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., at age 69. She died of breast cancer, according to her son Kelly Candaele, whose 1988 documentary about his mother's career, "A League of Their Own," inspired last summer's movie of the same name.         During her four seasons in the women's league that was formed in 1943 as a wartime alternative to the talent-depleted men's league, Mrs. St. Aubin, who played under her original name, Helen Callaghan, batted .257 and stole 354 bases in 388 games.         Mrs. St. Aubin was a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, who had been recruited at a Canadian softball tournament. Accompanied by her sister, Margie, who was sent by their father to keep an eye on her, she broke in with the expansion Minneapolis Millerettes in 1944 and was an immediate star. She stole 112 bases in 111 games, and her .287 batting average was the league's second highest.         In 1945, when the team moved to Indiana and became the Fort Wayne Daisies, Mrs. St. Aubin, a left-handed batter, led the league with a .299 average and in extra-base hits (24), doubles (17) and home runs (3).         She became ill in 1946 and sat out the 1947 season before returning for part of the 1948 season, her last, and she was never again as sharp at the plate. But she stole 114 bases in 111 games in 1946.         Her former teammate Dottie Collins recalled yesterday how deceptive her appearance was on the field.         "When she was playing -- running or throwing -- she looked so dainty, that's the only word for it," said Mrs. Collins, who recalled the 5-foot-1 1/4-inch, 115-pound outfielder as a "tiny" woman who was "strong."         According to Mrs. Collins, the treasurer of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, Mrs. St. Aubin's stance and swing are almost perfectly preserved in her son Casey Candaele, a switch-hitting infielder for the Houston Astros.         She married Bobby Candaele during her career and gave birth to the first of their five sons before the 1948 season. They settled in Lompoc, Calif., where she became a cleaning staff supervisor at a local hospital. She and Mr. Candaele were eventually divorced, and she later married Ronald J. St. Aubin.         The documentary Kelly Candaele and his friend Kim Wilson made in 1988 led directly to the movie starring Geena Davis and directed by Penny Marshall.         In addition to her husband, her sister, who is now Margaret Maxwell of Vancouver, and her sons Kelly and Casey, Mrs. St. Aubin is survived by a brother, Lou; two other sisters, Pearl McInnis and Kay Morrison; three other sons, Ricky, the former head football coach at the University of California at Santa Barbara; Rocky, a telephone company employee, and Kelly's twin brother, Kerry, a Richard Hofstadter fellow in history at Columbia University, plus three grandchildren.
