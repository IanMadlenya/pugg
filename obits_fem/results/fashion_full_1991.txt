         Jeanne A. Henabery, a public relations specialist in the beauty and fashion field, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, her husband, Robert, said.         Mrs. Henabery was president of Jeanne Henabery Associates, a public relations firm she started in 1970, and was also affiliated with her husband in his broadcast consulting company, Bob Henabery Associates.         She attended Bryant and Simmons College and also took courses at the School of Visual Arts, the Fashion Institute, Baruch College and the Herbert Berghof Studio. She began her career in the public relations department of the General Electric Company in Pittsfield, Mass., and was later with public-relations concerns in Detroit and in New York City.       
         With reminiscences and some of her favorite songs, friends of Mary Martin gathered at the Majestic Theater yesterday afternoon to celebrate her life.         Miss Martin, who died of cancer in November at the age of 76, was recalled as a high-spirited artist who personified some of her signature roles; the eternal child in "Peter Pan," the "cockeyed optimist" in "South Pacific," the ebullient and nurturing protector in "The Sound of Music."         "She was the greatest figure we're ever going to have in musical comedy," said Helen Hayes. She quickly amended the announcement to include Ethel Merman. "Mary would rap me over the knuckles in heaven when I got there," she said, if she did not cite Miss Merman.         Miss Hayes remembered a trip with Miss Martin 35 years ago to Paris, where they were to perform in "The Skin of Our Teeth." Miss Martin took along grand clothes, she recalled, and as they walked through the city one day, "suddenly overhead there was a swoosh of birds," one of whom "took perfect aim on Mary."         "I didn't know her too well," she said, and she feared Miss Martin would "have hysterics" at the marring of her outfit. But, Miss Hayes said, there was Miss Martin "looking at me with a sort of half-smile, and she said, 'For some people, they         sing.'         That was the beginning of our friendship." Gold Dust From the Air         Van Johnson told of the time Miss Martin decided to stage a benefit for a hospital where she had been recovering from a 1982 automobile accident. To his horror, he saw her putting on a harness to reprise a number from "Peter Pan." "I said, 'Mary, you're         not!' "         he recounted, "and she said, 'Oh, yes, I am, and I may not come back.' And she zoomed up to the roof and sprinkled gold dust all over our hair."         Recalling the same car accident and another sign of the artist's indomitable temperament, Florence Henderson cited a time when Miss Martin, still a patient, was given a walker, an object she had apparently never encountered. She took it on a promenade down the corridor. Other people smiled, and she smiled back, Ms. Henderson recalled, adding that "she was         carrying         the walker."         She described Miss Martin as "truly the purest soul that I have ever known," adding, "She was so generous; she always let people into her circle of light." As for artistry, Ms. Henderson recalled a tribute that Miss Merman had made, in her fashion. Asked by a reporter what she had thought of Miss Martin's performance at the opening of "South Pacific," Ms. Henderson said, Miss Merman snapped, "Oh, she's all right, if you like talent.' " New Lyrics to a Favorite Song         In one of several videotapes shown, Miss Martin and Miss Merman were seen singing a medley, alternating, performing together and gradually turning the duet into a mock competition.         Carol Channing performed a tribute to Miss Martin that put new words to "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," the song that propelled Miss Martin to Broadway success in 1938 in Cole Porter's "Leave It To Me." "She played a nurse/She played a nun/She played a boy who was a fairy," Ms. Channing sang. "She stopped the show when she had to crow/And our hearts belong to Mary."         Other participants included the performers John Raitt, Carol Lawrence and Kathleen Nolan and the choreographer Jerome Robbins. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent remarks in a videotape. Miss Martin's son, the actor Larry Hagman, and daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, introduced the program.         The event concluded with a 1983 videotape of Miss Martin singing a song from "Peter Pan." The tape's final image, of the artist with her arms outstretched, remained on the screen as participants in the memorial returned to the stage to applaud it.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Helen Lee Caldwell, a leading designer of children's clothes in Manhattan for three decades under the name Helen Lee, died on Wednesday at Fort Sanders Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn. She was 82 years old and had lived in Knoxville since 1981.         She died after a series of strokes, a spokesman for the family said.         In 1953 she became the first children's designer to win the Coty American Fashion Critics Award, for her designs for Youngland Inc. The award cited her "significant influence in the development of good taste and charm in children's fashions."  Clothes for Girls and Boys         For the next three decades, Miss Lee designed clothes for infants, girls, boys and teen-agers. She also created designs for Sears, Roebuck & Company; Saks Fifth Avenue; Alyssa, a children's fashion concern, and for her own company, Designs by Helen Lee Inc.         Despite the reputation of English children's clothes as the best in the world, her designs won accolades from critics at a London fashion show in 1962. One of the models, 3-year-old Cathryn Harrison, the granddaughter of the actor Rex Harrison, wore a white eyelet dress sashed with yellow and cried when asked to take the dress off after the showing.         A 1965 showing in Tokyo was received with equal enthusiasm by an international audience.  Designs Shown in Moscow         Miss Lee's designs appeared at the American Fair in Moscow in 1959 and in a dress worn by her granddaughter, Hilary Ball, on the cover of Life magazine in 1959.         As designer and partner of Alyssa, she received a Neiman-Marcus Award in 1958 and the Ethel Traphagen Award in 1970. She retired in the late 1970's.         Miss Lee was born in Knoxville and attended the University of Tennessee before coming to New York, where she studied at the Art Sudents League and at the Traphagen School of Art.         She is survived by a daughter, Jenny Higginbothan Caldwell of Newton, Mass., five grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Dagmar Freuchen-Gale, an artist and illustrator for such fashion magazines as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, died March 9 at a hospital in Fredensborg, Denmark. She was 83 years old and had lived in Fredensborg since the early 1970's.         She died as the result of a stroke, a friend, Donald Gaynor, said.         Mrs. Freuchen-Gale came to New York from the town of Lyngpy, outside Copenhagen, in 1938 and worked for various magazines. She also taught fashion illustration at the Art Students League for 20 years, from the late 1940's.         In 1943 she married Peter Freuchen, a Danish Arctic explorer and author.  She wrote "Cookbook of the Seven Seas" (1968), and also edited several of her husband's books. Mr. Freuchen died in 1963. In 1967 she married Henry Gale, a New York lawyer He died in 1969.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Natalie Donay, an advertising and cosmetics executive, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 63 years old.         Ms. Donay died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She began her career as an advertising copywriter for McCann Erickson, a Manhattan-based advertising agency. In the early 1950's she became advertising director of Charles of the Ritz.         Ms. Donay was responsible for discovering Vidal Sassoon, the hairdresser, in London and brought him and his geometric style to the United States in the mid-1960's. In 1964 Charles of the Ritz merged with Lanvin and she became creative director for both companies, now part of the Revlon Group.         In 1971 Ms. Donay rejoined McCann Erickson and moved to London, where she founded the London Fashion Group. She later retired to start an antique business in London.         A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.         Ms. Donay is survived by her husband, Donald Goddard, a writer.       
         Tatiana du Plessix Liberman, the leading hat designer for Saks Fifth Avenue for 20 years, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan and Warren, Conn.         She died of congestive heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Liberman, whose original name was Tatiana Yacovleff, was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on May 7, 1906, into a professional family that found sanctuary in Paris after the Bolshevik Revolution. She studied painting and sculpture, but also learned millinery to earn a living.         She was married to a French diplomat, Bertrand de Plessix, from 1929 until 1940 when he was killed by the Germans in their conquest of France.         She fled to New York with their daughter in 1941 and began designing hats for Henri Bendel. Within a year, she joined Saks Fifth Avenue and became head of its custom hat salon, designing with the signature Tatiana du Plessix until its Salon Moderne closed in 1963.         The designs were often praised by fashion reporters as irresistible. In 1950, Virginia Pope of The New York Times hailed the milliner as "a perfectionist" in assembling both materials and colors and for artful originality in flattering women of many types. The 1951 collection, Miss Pope wrote, excells in "both wit and wisdom."         In 1942, the designer married Alexander Liberman, an artist and editorial director of Conde Nast Publications. Mr. Liberman was an adolescent friend and fellow Russian emigre in Paris.         They kept close ties with friends from the Paris days and later with prominent Soviet artists who settled in the West, including Joseph Brodsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The couple's homes were also gathering places for friends like Salvador Dali, John Gunther, Marlene Dietrich and Christian Dior.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Liberman is survived by a daughter, the writer Francine du Plessix Gray, of Warren, Conn., a sister, Lila Duchess of Caylus, France, and two grandsons.       
         Gladys Marcus, dean of liberal arts at the Fashion Institute of Technology, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Marcus joined the faculty at the Fashion Institute of Technology as a part-time instructor in 1950. Before the year was out she had switched to full-time teaching. She left in 1952 to devote herself to her family. She returned to the institute in 1957 and, in 1977, was named dean of liberal arts.         She was instrumental in expanding and maintaining a broad-based liberal arts program at the school as part of its career-oriented degree programs. A proponent of global education, she initiated an overseas curriculum for the fashion institute. She was a member of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools visiting teams evaluating other colleges.         A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of New York University. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and received an M.A. from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.         From 1943 to 1946, she served in the Navy as a lieutenant.         She is survived by a son Bret, of Manhattan, news director at WNBC-TV.       
         Isabel Cary Lundberg, an educator and sociologist, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Dr. Lundberg, a 1925 graduate of Vassar College, was an editor at several magazines, including Cosmopolitan, and an assistant to the president of an educational consulting firm before earning a Ph.D. in 1957 from the New School for Social Research. She then taught sociology at Hunter College, New York University and the Fashion Institute of Technology. She was a member of the American Sociological Association and wrote "Turgot's Unknown Translator: The Reflections and Adam Smith," published in 1964 by Martinus Nijhoff in The Hague.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Joan Caulfield, an actress who starred in films of the 1940's and in television situation comedies of the 1950's, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.  She was 69 years old and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         She died of cancer, a hospital spokesman said.         Miss Caulfield was propelled to stardom by the films "Monsieur Beaucaire," in which she appeared with Bing Crosby, and "Blue Skies," with Bob Hope, both released in 1946, and by "Dear Ruth," appearing opposite William Holden, in 1947. On television she was a co-star of "My Favorite Husband," on CBS from 1953 to 1957, and "Sally" on NBC in the 1957-58 season.         Miss Caulfield, who was a native of West Orange, N.J., attended Columbia University and was a fashion model and a cover girl before she landed ingenue roles on Broadway in the early 1940's. Her first stage success was in the 1943 production of the comedy "Kiss and Tell," in which she appeared for 14 months. Paramount Pictures promptly offered her a contract and she began her Hollywood career with "Miss Suzie Slagle's," in 1946. Occasional Film Appearances         Her films made the most of her beauty, although she was determined to win a reputation as an actress and not, as she said, "just a decoration."         In 1950, Miss Caulfield married the film producer Frank Ross and subsequently appeared only occasionally in films. She and Mr. Ross were divorced in 1960. She later married Robert Peterson, a dentist, from whom she was also divorced.         She is survived by two sons, Caulfield Kevin Ross of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and John Caulfield Peterson of Sacramento, Calif.; two sisters, Mary Parker of Stuart, Fla., and Elizabeth Victor of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  June 21, 1991, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Joan Caulfield, the actress, reversed the identities of the male stars in two films. Bing Crosby starred in "Blue Skies," Bob Hope in "Monsieur Beaucaire."       
         Elizabeth Sorel, a former fashion model, died Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Sorel died of complications from leukemia, said her daughter, Claudette.         In the 1920's and early 1930's, Mrs. Sorel was one of the most sought-after models in Paris, modeling for members of the haute couture like Jean Patou, Jacques Fath and Chanel. A native of Budapest, she came to the United States in the early 1940's and, with her husband, operated Sorel Belt Creations in Manhattan. The store was later sold. She also worked for Saks Fifth Avenue as an accessories designer for Sophie Gibel.         With her husband, Michel, who died in 1989, Mrs. Sorel operated the Shelton Apartments Inc., a real estate firm in Manhattan, from 1947 to her death.         She is survived by a daughter, Claudette, a concert pianist and a professor of music at the State University of New York at Fredonia, of Manhattan.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Eleanor Pollock Hughes, former top editor of three national magazines and a public relations executive for several Federal agencies, died Friday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 91 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.         Mrs. Hughes died of heart disease, friends said.         Known professionally as Eleanor Pollock, she was a magazine editor in New York City for nearly three decades, starting in the 1930's. She was the editor in chief of Cue and Family Life, the managing editor of Charm and an assistant to Fleur Cowles in the women's division of Look and Quick magazines at Cowles Publications.         Switching to daily newspapers, she became the editor of the women's section at the Philadelphia Bulletin from the late 1950's to 1965. In that period she was also chairwoman of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award organization. Held Various Federal Posts         Serving in the Government from 1965 to 1973, she variously held the posts of the White House liaison for Project Head Start, public affairs director for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Commission on Product Safety and the National Commission on Materials Policy and press secretary to Betty Furness, when she was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs.         After leaving government employment, Mrs. Hughes did freelance writing and public relations consulting.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Alice Leal Pollock, an actress and playwright, and was educated at the Gardner and Finch Schools.         She was married and divorced from Byron Darnton, a reporter for The New York Times who was the first American correspondent killed while covering World War II. Her second husband, Albion Hughes, also a journalist, is deceased.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Mary McDonough Phillips, an editor who helped train a generation of fashion journalists, died last Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long illness. She was 77 years old and lived in New York City and Jupiter, Fla.         She had suffered from a blood disorder for more than 20 years, said her husband, Lynn Phillips.         Soon after graduating from Rosemount College in Rosemount, Pa., in 1935, she joined the Hearst Corporation, starting at Good Housekeeping magazine. She then moved to Harper's Bazaar, becoming executive editor in 1952. Carmel Snow, Nancy White and Dianna Vreeland were among her associates during the 1950's and 1960's.         In 1971 she was named director of marketing of Harper's Bazaar, and in 1980 became retail marketing manager of Town & Country. Though she retired in 1984, she continued as consultant to Town & Country until the end.         Through much of her career, she served as liaison between editorial and advertising deparments and helped shape the direction of the magazines for which she worked. Her friends included major fashion figures such as the designers Ben Zuckerman, Archie Davidow and Norman Norell.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Michael, of St. Louis, four grandchildren and a brother, Edward, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.
