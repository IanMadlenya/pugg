        Dr. Charlotte Friend, a medical microbiologist who made major contributions to the understanding of cancer during a career that spanned almost four decades, died Tuesday after a long illness. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Charlotte Friend, a medical microbiologist who made major contributions to the understanding of cancer during a career that spanned almost four decades, died Tuesday after a long illness. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         In 1956, Dr. Friend discovered a virus that causes leukemia in mice. The virus, named the Friend virus, has been an important tool for study of the relationships between animal cancers and viruses for many years.         At the time of her death, Dr. Friend was professor and director of the Center for Experimental Cell Biology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. Her most important scientific achievements were in immunology and the relationships between cancer and viruses. She also helped shape the educational and research philosophy of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, which was just getting started when she joined its faculty in 1966.         ''Her presence was a major factor in establishing at the fledgling medical school a balance between emphasis on clinical care and on basic scientific research,'' said Dr. Nathan Kase, dean of the medical school. New Concept on Cancer         Her recent contributions included evidence that cancer cells may be capable of progressing - differentiating - from the cancerous state to normalcy if subjected to appropriate chemical stimuli. In theory, that concept might lead to an entirely new type of cancer treatment in which the goal would be that of selectively favoring the growth of normal cells rather than simply killing cancer cells. Conventional anti-cancer drugs act mainly by killing cancer cells, but they kill many normal cells in the process.         The new concept of inducing differentiation to normalcy in cancer tissues is undergoing early tests in patients at several research centers under the sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute and other agencies.         When Dr. Friend began studies of animal cancer viruses, most scientists considered it heretical to suggest that viruses might also be involved in human cancers. Today several viruses are known to be crucial factors in causing human cancers. Many years of research with animal cancer viruses was indispensible to proving the links between other viruses and human cancers.         The Friend virus has been so important in cancer research that it is the focus of an entire chapter in Oncogenic Viruses, a definitive text on cancer virus research by Dr. Ludwik Gross of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in the Bronx.         She was born in New York, March 11, 1921, received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944 and a doctorate in bacteriology from Yale University in 1950. She worked at Sloan-Kettering Institute and Cornell Medical College until 1966 when she moved to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.         She is survived by a sister, Pricilla Simon of the Bronx, and a brother, Morris of Massapequa, L.I.         CHARLOTTE FRIEND DIES AT 65       
        Dr. Lauretta Bender, a child neuro-psychiatrist, researcher and educator, died Jan. 4 in a nursing home in Annapolis, Md. She was 88 years old and lived in Annapolis.         Dr. Lauretta Bender, a child neuro-psychiatrist, researcher and educator, died Jan. 4 in a nursing home in Annapolis, Md. She was 88 years old and lived in Annapolis.         Dr. Bender was known for developing, in 1923, the Bender-Gestault Visual Motor Test, a neuropsychological examination that has become a worldwide standard. She spent many years researching the cause of childhood schizophrenia and was responsible for studies on child suicides and violence.         In 1955, Dr. Bender received the Adolf Meyer Memorial Award for her contributions to the understanding of schizophrenic children.         She became a staff member of Bellevue Hospital in 1930 and later was senior psychiatrist in charge of the Children's Service at the hospital, a post she held for 21 years. Consulant to Children's Guild         Also in 1955, Dr. Bender was appointed principal research scientist in child psychiatry, a new post in the State Mental Hygiene Department. She continued working with the state until 1973, when she moved to Annapolis. Dr. Bender taught at the University of Maryland and was a consultant to the Children's Guild Inc., a group that works with emotionally disturbed youngsters, and similar organizations.         She was born in Butte, Mont. Dr. Bender graduated with a B.S. from the University of Chicago in 1922 and an M.A. in pathology in 1923. She received a medical degree from the State University of Iowa in 1926.         After completing her internship and residency at Billings Hospital of the University of Chicago, she became a resident psychiatrist at Boston Psychopathic Hospital from 1928 to 1929. From 1929 to 1930, Dr. Bender was a research associate in psychiatry at the Phipps Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital.         Dr. Bender was a member of such organizations as the American Psychiatric Association; the American Neurological Association, the American Academy of Child Psychiatry and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She was also on the Citizen's Committee for Children of New York City Inc.         Dr. Bender had been married to Dr. Paul Schilder, a Viennese psychiatrist who was an associate of Freud. Dr. Schilder died in 1940. In 1968, Dr. Bender married Dr. Henry Banford Parks, a historian and professor at New York University. He died in 1973.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Peter Schilder of Annapolis; a daughter, Jane S. Knowles of Santa Fe, N.M.; three grandchildren, and a brother, Karl Bender of Milwaukee, Ore.       
        Dr. Helen B. Lewis, a psychoanalyst and professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old and also had a home in Croydon, N.H.         Dr. Helen B. Lewis, a psychoanalyst and professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old and also had a home in Croydon, N.H.

        Helen Taft Manning, professor emeritus of history and longtime dean of Bryn Mawr College, died Saturday of pneumonia at a nursing home in suburban Philadelphia. She was 95 years old.         Helen Taft Manning, professor emeritus of history and longtime dean of Bryn Mawr College, died Saturday of pneumonia at a nursing home in suburban Philadelphia. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Manning, a specialist in British colonial history, served as dean from 1917 to 1919 and from 1925 to 1941. She later served as professor of history and head of the department, retiring in 1957.         She was the daughter of William Howard Taft, the 27th President and, until his death in 1930, the 10th Chief Justice of the United States.         Miss Taft graduated from Bryn Mawr in 1915, was named dean in 1917 and rose to acting president in 1919. She left to earn her doctorate at Yale, reclaiming the deanship in 1925.         In 1920, she married Frederick Johnson Manning, a history professor who then moved from Yale to Swarthmore College.         Mrs. Manning is survived by two daughters, Helen Manning Hunter, an economics professor at Bryn Mawr, and Caroline Cunningham, a teacher at the Manhattan School of Music.

        Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Inna Kitrosskaya Meiman, the wife of a Soviet dissident, died yesterday at the Lombardi Cancer Research Center of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, three weeks after she was allowed to go abroad for treatment of an inoperable tumor on her neck. She was 53 years old and had been waiting years for permission to travel.         Gerald Strober, a spokesman for the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which helped to plead her case, said Mrs. Meiman was admitted to the center on Jan. 20. In asking to go abroad, Mrs. Meiman said she wanted to undergo specialized radiation treatment, her only remaining hope for survival. Complications Reported         According to Mr. Strober, she had various tests complicated by low blood pressure, drug-induced diabetes and infection.         ''Basically she was still being evaluated for the start of chemotherapy,'' Mr. Strober said.  She was the wife of Prof. Naum Meiman, a mathematician who himself had long been denied an exit visa on the ground that he did secret work 30 years ago. Professor Meiman, 76 years of age, was a member of a now-disbanded group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki accords of 1975.         Professor Meiman said last month that he did not think officials might relent and let him follow his wife now that her health had become precarious. He said that his wife had undergone chemotherapy and four operations and that her only chance lay in American experimental treatment.         Mrs. Meiman, a teacher of English, was married to Professor Meiman in 1981.         Word that she might be able to leave first came from Senator Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat and possible Democratic Presidential candidate, while he was on a visit to Moscow in December. He said he had made a special plea for her to Mikhael S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.         Later, in a meeting, with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Senator Hart was informed of that the case was being ''reconsidered.'' Another Soviet cancer patient, Rimma Bravve, left Moscow on Dec. 18 in Senator Hart's company to receive treatment in New York. Left With Mixed Feelings         At the time of her own departure, Mrs. Meiman said she was leaving with ''mixed feelings'' since her husband had to stay behind. She said she had been feeling weak for some weeks and was eager to enter the Georgetown center.         Donna Hartman, the wife of Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman, accompanied Mrs. Meiman through routine customs and passport controls.         Mrs. Meiman is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Leo Kitrossky, a scientist in Moscow with three children. Also surviving is a daughter of Professor Meiman by a previous marriage, Olga Plam of Boulder, Colo.         INNA MEIMAN, EMIGRE, DIES AT 53       
        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.

        Eleanor Burke Leacock, a professor of anthropology at City College of the City University of New York, died of a stroke Thursday at the Straub Medical Center Hospital in Honolulu. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Eleanor Burke Leacock, a professor of anthropology at City College of the City University of New York, died of a stroke Thursday at the Straub Medical Center Hospital in Honolulu. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Leacock had been on the City College faculty since 1972, and was chairwoman of the anthropology department from 1974 to 1984.         She was the author of ''Myths of Male Dominance,'' a collection of essays on women's role in society.         Dr. Leacock was born in Weehawken, N.J., and raised in Manhattan. She was a graduate of Barnard College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in anthropology from Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, James Haughton; four children, Elspeth, Claudia Leacock Dougherty, Robert, all of Manhattan, and David, of Golden Meadow, La.; her father, Kenneth Burke, the poet and critic, of Andover, N.J.; two sisters, Elspeth Hart, of Brooklyn, and France Burke, of Manhattan; two brothers, Michael Burke of Manhattan, and Anthony Burke of Victoria, British Columbia, and six grandchildren.       
        Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         In a 25-year career with The Times, Miss Curtis, as a reporter and as an editor, helped transform the coverage of fashion and society news, supervised the daily page of opinion opposite the editorial page and for the last four years wrote a weekly column of social commentary.         Her column, a blend of reporting and observation that appeared each Tuesday, was discontinued last June, when Miss Curtis became ill and went to Columbus for medical treatment. Her husband, Dr. William E. Hunt, is professor and director of the division of neurologic surgery at the College of Medicine at Ohio State University.         ''Charlotte Curtis, who graced this newspaper for over 25 years, was a warm and considerate friend who could write with a rapier and who, as an editor, was eternally curious and questioning,'' Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, said yesterday. ''As a person and as a superb journalist, she will be missed and mourned.'' Expanded Coverage         As editor of women's and family/ style news from 1965 to 1974, Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received.         Under her direction, reporting on the renascent feminist movement and on controversial issues such as abortion replaced the features on good grooming and shopping that had traditionally appeared on women's news pages.         As an associate editor of The Times in charge of the Op-Ed page from 1974 to 1982, she brought an eclectic approach to a broad range of commentary and analysis on major social, economic and political issues of the day. In that post, she was the first woman to have her name listed on the masthead of The New York Times among its senior editors.         But it was as a society news reporter in the 1960's, chronicling the life styles of the rich and powerful, that Miss Curtis became one of the nation's best-known journalists and set a pattern followed by other writers. Other publications heralded her iconoclastic style, the precision of her technique and the research behind it. ''The Times' girl on the beat studies her subjects with the detachment of a professional sociologist,'' Time magazine reported in February 1965. An Incisive Wit         A strong-willed, indefatigable Vassar graduate with an incisive wit, Miss Curtis documented the mores and foibles of America's constantly evolving upper crust. She scrutinized both aristocrats and parvenus in sybaritic settings: Manhattan penthouses, mansions in Newport and Palm Beach, yachts in the Caribbean, tents in Persepolis and the clubhouses at Churchill and Epsom Downs.         In Palm Beach, she reported on a dowager who installed a marble terrace so her dogs, suffering from the heat, could cool their bellies.         ''Bostonians are an elegantly athletic lot,'' she wrote in a 1965 story about a society ball. ''They prove it periodically by swirling, twirling and swooping about in graceful dance patterns until beads of perspiration materialize on their aristocratic brows.'' The Telling Moment         At a cocktail party held by Leonard Bernstein for the Black Panthers in 1970, when a Panther field marshal stridently outlined his tenets before a small group that included Mr. Bernstein, principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Miss Curtis caught the telling moment:         '' 'If business won't give us full employment, then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people.'         '' 'I dig absolutely,' Mr. Bernstein said.''         Tom Wolfe, who wrote about the same party in his book ''Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,'' said of the ensuing flap: ''It wasn't anything she wrote that infuriated them. It was that she put down exactly what they said. That's always what seems cruelest of all, to hold up a mirror to people that way.''         In addition to her society and family/ style reporting, Miss Curtis over the years pursued a variety of stories with datelines from around the world. Deep Interest in Politics         Her deepest interest, dating from her college days, was in American politics and culture. She covered a number of national political conventions, including the violence-wracked Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, as well as Presidential campaigns and inaugurations.         In June 1968 she was in the press corps aboard the funeral train that carried the body of Senator Robert F. Kennedy from New York to Washington. Describing his eldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, she wrote about the heir to a political dynasty:         ''Down the swaying train he went, putting out his hand in 19 of the other 20 cars saying, 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' while outside in the early afternoon sun, the old men of Linden, N.J., stood silently in their undershirts and the women held handkerchiefs to their faces.         '' 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' he said to strangers, his pin-stripe black suit not yet a shambles from the failing air-conditioning, his PT boat tie clip neatly in place. 'Thanks for coming, thanks for coming.' ''         She was the author of ''First Lady,'' a 1963 book about Jacqueline Kennedy's first year in the White House, and ''The Rich and Other Atrocities,'' a 1976 collection of many of her articles. She also contributed writings to several other books, wrote articles for magazines and was a radio commentator in New York and Ohio. Many Honors for Reporting         Miss Curtis was the recipient of many honors for her reporting, including awards from the New York Newspaper Women's Club, the Ohio Newspaper Women's Club, the New York and Los Angeles branches of Women in Communications, the American Newspaper Women's Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the University of Southern California. She also received five honorary degrees.         A porcelain figurine of a woman with pale blue eyes and impeccably coiffed auburn hair, Miss Curtis stood 5 feet 1 inch tall in her high-heeled Chanel pumps. Her image of Junior League elegance - ladylike suits, discreet quantities of real jewelry and a faint aura of expensive French perfume -was one not usually visible in newsrooms.         Charlotte Murray Curtis was born in Chicago on Dec. 19, 1928, the daughter of George Morris and Lucile Atcherson Curtis. Her father was a surgeon who later took the family to Columbus, and her mother was a diplomat who had been the first woman to be a field officer in the Foreign Service, holding posts with American legations in Switzerland, Panama and Haiti.         Miss Curtis graduated from the Columbus School for Girls, then went to Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., majoring in United States history. After graduating in 1950, she joined The Columbus Citizen, where she was a reporter and society editor for 11 years. Joined The Times in 1961         In 1961, she was hired by The New York Times as a fashion reporter. Two years later, she was assigned to the society beat, with a mandate from Clifton Daniel, then an assistant managing editor, to ''write about society as news and to treat it as sociology.''         In 1965, she was named editor of women's news, a title that was changed to family/style editor in 1971. In 1974, she became editor of the Op-Ed page, leavening serious pieces by academic, government and business leaders with unexpected essays on lighter subjects, such as an exchange of letters between Henry Miller and Erica Jong entitled ''In Praise of Rabelais and Each Other,'' and with bits of Americana, from lesser-known writers.         Besides her husband, Miss Curtis is survived by a sister, Mary Curtis Davey of Los Altos, Calif., three stepchildren and three nieces and nephews.         A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date to be set.         The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the William E. Hunt Fund, Ohio State University Development Fund No. 523340, in care of the Division of Neurologic Surgery, Ohio State University Hospital, 410 West 10th Avenue, N-935 D.H., Columbus, Ohio, 43210.

Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

She wrote many stories for and about adolescent boys for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines during the 1930's, and her first book, ''Blocking Back,'' was published in 1938. Many of her early works, such as ''Shattuck Cadet'' (1940) and ''Camp Hero'' (1942), were realistic tales of sports and camp life that captured the relationships and slang of her primarily male teen-age heroes.         Although she continued to write short stories for children and adolescents in the 1940's, Miss Chute began to concentrate on adult fiction with ''The Fields Are White,'' a 1950 book about marriage and manners.         Her best-known novel, ''Greenwillow'' (1956), was described by a critic as ''a deeply moving, gently humorous and serenely wise'' story of young love and self-discovery. It was made into a Broadway musical in 1960. Subsequent works included a 1957 anthology called ''The Blue Cup and Other Stories,'' ''The Story of a Small Life'' (1971) and ''Katie: An Impertinent Fairy Tale'' (1978). Taught at Barnard         Her most recent novel, ''The Good Woman'' (1986), was a parable about a lonely woman who abandons her home for a journey of spiritual awakening while living on the streets.         Miss Chute - who preferred to be called Joy and signed her books B. J. Chute - moved to New York in the early 1940's with her mother and two sisters. Over the years, she did volunteer work with poor children and the Police Athletic League. She became an adjunct professor of English at Barnard College in 1964, and taught creative writing there until her death.         She was also director of Books Across the Sea, a division of the English-Speaking Union that promoted American books overseas, and was an active member and one-time president of the American chapter of PEN, the writer's association.

She was 66 years old.         Dr. Emily Mumford, a sociologist known for her work on the effect of psychotherapy in lowering later medical care costs, died of complications of a brain tumor Oct. 3 at her home in Manhattan. She was 66 years old.         Dr. Mumford was professor of clinical sociomedical sciences in psychiatry and public health at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University and chief of the division of health utilization and policy research at the New York Psychiatric Institute.         Studies in which she took part reported that the person who undergoes psychotherapy develops a healthier style of living and is less apt to require unneeded hospitalization. Thus the cost of psychotherapy is offset, the studies showed.         Dr. Mumford's writings included a textbook on medical sociology, ''Interns: From Students to Physicians.''         She was born in Missouri and graduated from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. While working as a magazine editor, she took courses at Columbia University that drew her toward sociology. She received a master's degree and doctorate in sociology from Columbia.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Herbert J. Schlesinger, who is Albert J. Marrow Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research.
