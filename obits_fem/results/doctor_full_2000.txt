         Elsie Widdowson, a nutritionist who used the discipline of wartime rationing to prescribe the healthiest diet in British history, died in Cambridge on June 14. She was 93.         The diet was an experimental plan for the goverment to promote for the citizens of Britain once its imports were impeded. Dr. Widdowson wrote it with her research partner of 60 years, Dr. R. A. McCance. It was based on bread, cabbage and potatoes, all of which were in relatively plentiful supply. Though aging British people, traditionally habitues of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, are most apt to remember the numbing taste of questionable delicacies like dried eggs, nutritionists say the lean, mean diet was the most nutritious the English ever forced down.         But that was only a small part of the legacy of the team known as ''Mac and Elsie.'' They profoundly affected how the world assessed nutritional values, how it investigated dietary deficiencies and how mammalian development was perceived. The two researchers would from time to time starve or overfeed volunteers of different age groups to study their metabolism. Their findings in the late 1930's on the body's need for salt became a key part of care for patients in diabetic comas and those with other ailments.         Along the way, they found time to do varied projects like studying the nutritional needs of concentration camp survivors and writing a medical journal article titled ''Food Lore From Nursery Rhymes.''         Working on her own at age 80, Dr. Widdowson chased seals on the Labrador ice floes to study their eating habits. A decade later, she published a paper on the physiology of the newborn bear.         Known for the twinkle in her eye, she kept generations of cats on her little farm, raised tomatoes, apples and bees, and ate lots of butter and eggs, which she considered good for people. Her sense of humor is suggested by her final advice after many an academic lecture: ''Take it with a grain of salt.''         She even gave the lie to the British maxim ''as different as chalk and cheese.'' To deal with the lack of calcium in people's diets because of a cheese shortage during World War II, she and Dr. McCance successfully pressed the government to add chalk to bread.         ''There is no branch of nutrition science, past or present, that has not been influenced in some way by the results of her pioneering work,'' a statement by the British Nutrition Foundation said, ''and because of the inspiration and encouragement she gave to nutrition scientists of all ages in the United Kingdom and overseas.''         Elsie May Widdowson was born and raised in Dulwich in Southeast London. She is survived by a younger sister, Eva Crane, who also became a noted scientist and for more than 30 years was director of the International Bee Research Association.         Their parents nourished the innate talent of the girls, who attended Sydenham County Secondary School. Elsie was one of the first women to graduate from Imperial College in London, where she studied chemistry. She also obtained her doctorate from Imperial, studying the chemistry of the compounds produced in ripening and stored fruit. She went to King's College in London to do postgraduate work on the subject.         She found herself spending time in hospital kitchens. She met a young doctor, Dr. McCance, who was studying the chemical consequences of cooking food. She realized his analyses of the carbohydrates in fruit were incorrect and told him so. He was delighted, and arranged a grant so she could work with him. Their collaboration continued until his death in 1993.         The initial step was combining her research on fruits and vegetables and his on meat, then collecting information on foods generally. The result was their 1940 book ''The Chemical Composition of Foods,'' which is known as the dietitian's bible and is now about to be published in its sixth edition.         With the onset of rationing, the two made guinea pigs of themselves and other scientists, living on questionable treats like Woolton Pie; it consisted of vegetables and bread crumbs and was named for Lord Woolton, the wartime Minister of Food, who fiercely promoted their very lean cuisine.         To prove the diet's effectiveness, the scientists decamped to the Lake District for vigorous exercise. In one day, they walked 36 miles and climbed 7,000 feet, burning 4,700 calories. They were none the worse for it. The only serious worry was a lack of calcium, a problem handled by adding ground chalk to bread flour.         After the war, Dr. Widdowson was asked to study how to treat the gross starvation suffered by survivors of Nazi concentration camps. She was then asked to study children in two German orphanages. She was amazed to find that children who had been given extra bread, jam and orange juice did worse in terms of development and growth than those who had not.         The difference, Dr. Widdowson surmised, could be explained only by the personality of the director at the orphanage where extra nutrition was provided. She was ''stern and forbidding, ruling the home with a rod of iron,'' Dr. Widdowson wrote. ''Children and staff lived in constant fear of her reprimands and criticisms, which were often quite unreasonable.''         It turned out that love was the healthiest food of all.       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Miki Denhof, one of the first women to be the art director of a magazine, and a noted mentor of fashion photographers, died on Wednesday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 88.         In 1945, when Ms. Denhof joined Conde Nast, its fashion and lifestyle magazines were widely influential for their use of elegant typography and conceptual photography, approaches in which she, too, excelled. The executive art director, Alexander Liberman, installed Ms. Denhof as promotion art director of Vogue. There, ''she was a creative force and arbiter of quality,'' said a friend and colleague, Estelle Ellis.         ''She also developed a keen ability to edit pictures into narrative sequences and was deft with type,'' Ms. Ellis continued. ''She transcended the conventions of advertising design at that time.''         Later named the editorial art director for House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Ms. Denhof collaborated with Mr. Liberman, refining the typographic and photographic styles that characterized those publications.         But she was not simply a stylist. ''Miki always had a sense of the big picture,'' said Don Wise, who was art director of the Glamour promotion art department in the 1950's. ''She designed in an intellectual way, using words as integral parts of her pictures. Now designers routinely integrate type and image, but she did it before most others.''         In the 60's, at Glamour, she nurtured and mentored many American and European-emigre photographers, including David Bailey, Frank Horvat, Jeanloup Sieff, Louis Faurer and Saul Leiter.         ''She was the only art director I wouldn't question,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''She could put 22 pictures on a spread and I wouldn't worry. She'd always do it right.''         Ms. Denhof was born in 1912 in Trieste, Italy, raised in Austria and educated in Vienna and Berlin. She left Germany for New York with her family in 1938.         One of her earliest design jobs was as an assistant to the Modernist designer Paul Rand at Esquire and Apparel Arts magazines. She was also art director of Conde Nast Books, responsible for such titles as ''Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age 1914-1936'' with Diane Edkins, and ''The Successful Face'' with Amy Green.         After leaving Conde Nast in 1977 she designed exhibitions, catalogs and a documentary book for the Guild Hall in East Hampton, which also mounted an exhibition of her editorial layouts.         She spent the last few years archiving the photo albums and diaries of her father, Bernhard Bardach, a doctor in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Recently she donated 900 of the photographs to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. Some were used in the 1999 exhibition ''Fighting for the Fatherland: The Patriotism of Jews in World War I.''         Ms. Denhof was divorced from Hans Denhof, who is deceased. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Ethel Brown Fitzgerald, a former New York City teacher and school administrator, lawyer and musician, died July 19 at a hospital in upstate Amsterdam. She was 68 and lived in Fonda, N.Y., and Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Fitzgerald spent 16 often contentious years on the City Board of Education's semiautonomous Board of Examiners, from 1974 until the State Legislature restructured it out of existence in 1990. She served variously as a member, vice chairwoman and chairwoman.         The examiners tested prospective teachers and supervisors and drew up lists from which the school board appointed job candidates. Their critics charged the panel had become a cumbersome anachronism and a bottleneck.         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's view the chancellor and school board were trying to circumvent the merit system. Indeed, she asserted, they flirted with the very Tammany Hall-style patronage system that led to the creation of the independent examiners in the first place, in 1898.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Fitzgerald was a 1954 music graduate of Hunter College and taught orchestral and choral music in the public schools until 1967. As Ethel Brown, a member of the musicians' union, she played the cello with professional symphony orchestras.         By 1968 she had completed her graduate work at Brooklyn College, Columbia University and New York University. She received the certificate of an education supervisor and administrator from Hunter, and, in 1981, she received a doctor of laws degree from Brooklyn Law School.         She held a number of positions as assistant principal, principal and teachers' trainer before being appointed to the Board of Examiners, then practically a lifetime job. In recent years she had been in private law practice in Fonda.         Mrs. Fitzgerald is survived by a son, Dr. Kim Fitzgerald of Cleveland; her mother, Effie Hargett Brown of Fonda; and six grandchildren.
