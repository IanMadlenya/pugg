         Katherine Pollak Ellickson, a retired labor economist with a lifelong commitment to the women's and union movements, died on Dec. 28 at the White Sands retirement community in La Jolla, Calif. She was 91 and had lived in Washington until 1978.         Ms. Ellickson was long associated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations and, later, with the merged A.F.L.-C.I.O.         She served as executive director of the White House Commission on the Status of Women during the Kennedy Administration.         A native of Yonkers, she grew up in Manhattan and studied economics at Vassar College, graduating in 1926.         She started her career in workers' education at Brookwood Labor College and also did field work in Southern textile mills and coal camps in West Virginia.         She did organizational work for the C.I.O. in the late 1930's and joined its national office as associate director of research in 1942.         Among her duties was liaison with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.         In 1961, she was enlisted to help prepar the President's Commission on the Status of Women and became is executive director under Eleanor Roosevelt and Esther Peterson.         She also assisted in the creation of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in the early 1960's.         She retired in 1967 after a brief stint with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.         She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Senturia of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Robert C., of Woodbridge, Conn., and three grandchildren. Her husband, John C. Ellickson, died in 1970.       
         Mae Barnes, the sassy pop-jazz singer and dancer who introduced the Charleston on Broadway and later became a New York nightclub legend, died at Jamaica Hospital in Boston on Dec. 13. She was 89.         She was being treated for cancer, said a friend, the theater historian Delilah Jackson.         At the height of her popularity, Ms. Barnes appeared so frequently at the Bon Soir, a Greenwich Village cabaret, that the club was nicknamed ''the Barnes Soir.''         Famous for her special material -- songs like ''(I Ain't Gonna Be No) Topsy,'' an assertion of black pride that was ahead of its time -- and famous for her irreverent interpolations into familiar lyrics, Ms. Barnes loved to poke fun at the songs of the day. Twisting a key line in Harold Arlen's ''One for My Baby,'' the words ''set 'em up Joe,'' became ''stick 'em up, Joe.''         Other signature songs included ''On the Sunny Side of the Street,'' ''I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,'' ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' and ''They Raided the Joint and Took Everybody Down but Me,'' all sung in a rhythmically charged style that combined the insinuation of the bawdy blues with taut jazz phrasing.         Ms. Barnes, whose original name was Edith May Stith, was born in New York in 1907 and grew up in Manhattan. At age 12 she dropped out of school, telling the administration she was moving to Cleveland, and got a job as a chorus girl at the Plantation Club in Harlem. She toured the South as a vaudeville performer and in 1924 made her Broadway debut in the revue ''Runnin' Wild.'' The show, which introduced the Charleston to Broadway, also featured another legend-to-be, Elizabeth Welch.         As a stage performer, Ms. Barnes was nicknamed ''the bronze Ann Pennington,'' after the Broadway dancing star of George White's Scandals. Her dancing in the national tour of another show, ''Shuffle Along,'' led Bill Robinson to call her ''the greatest living female tap dancer.'' When a car accident in 1938 fractured her pelvis, she turned to singing.         ''I took the rhythm from my dancing and put it in my songs,'' she later said. As her cabaret career developed, she graduated from dives to more upscale New York clubs like Cerutti, the Little Casino and the Blue Angel. In the early 1950's she became the mainstay of the Bon Soir, the cellar club on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village that later became a showcase for Barbra Streisand. A favorite of high society, she frequently performed at Elsa Maxwell's parties and counted the Duke and Duchess of Windsor among her friends.         She also appeared in a 1950 edition of the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' that closed in Boston. Her final Broadway appearance was in 1954 in the Dorothy Fields-Arthur Schwartz musical ''By the Beautiful Sea,'' starring Shirley Booth.         She continued to perform in clubs around the world into the 1960's and recorded for Atlantic and Vanguard Records. She is prominently featured on ''The Erteguns' New York: New York Cabaret Music,'' (Atlantic), an anthology released in 1987.         No immediate family members survive.         A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue and 54th Street, at 3 P.M. on Jan. 30.       
         Marie Collins McGuire Thompson, who worked to improve the design of public housing for the elderly and low-income people as the Public Housing Administrator in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died last Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mrs. Thompson was 92 and lived in Kensington, Md.         Marie McGuire, as she was known, came to public housing with an aversion to ''bare, stark shelter'' that, she said, ''has brought no happiness to us.'' Instead, she espoused programs to create homes of which their occupants could be proud. Her advocacy drew criticism from legislators and defenders of traditional approaches, but architectural organizations backed her. Housing projects begun under her leadership won unaccustomed design awards.         She came to national attention as executive director of the San Antonio Housing Authority, where she championed amenities like balconies for every apartment. Studying the special needs of the elderly with limited means, she insisted on features like weatherproof ramps, handrails in all rooms and corridors and emergency bells in the bathrooms.         Her crowning achievement was the Golden Age Center, with 185 low-rent apartments designed for the elderly, that opened in 1960 in San Antonio. The next year, President John F. Kennedy recruited her as the first woman to become Public Housing Administrator. She held the post until 1966, when her office was merged into the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. There she became special assistant to the Secretary, working on housing and problems that affect the disabled and the elderly.         She left the Government in 1972. Until 1982, she was the housing specialist at the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, now the Center for Social Gerontology in Ann Arbor, Mich.         Mrs. Thompson was born in the Georgetown area of Washington. She studied journalism at George Washington University and, years later, studied architecture and real estate management at the University of Houston.         She wrote four books, ''Housing for the Elderly'' (1957), ''Housing and the Disabled'' (1976), ''Housing for the Handicapped'' (1977) and ''Housing for Rural Elderly'' (1982).         Her first marriage, to John McGuire, a Government geologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Thomas B. Thompson of San Antonio, an architect, died in 1983. She is survived by a sister, Margaret C. Schweinhaut, also of Kensington.       
         Marie Torre, a former television columnist for The New York Herald Tribune who was jailed for refusing to disclose a source in a libel action, died on Friday at Health South Rehabilitation Hospital of Greater Pittsburgh in Monroeville, Pa. She was 72 and lived in Salem, N.J.         She died of lung cancer, said her son-in-law, Ed Lopez of Manhattan.         Miss Torre served 10 days in the Hudson County Jail in New Jersey in 1959, the first reporter to gain national attention for going to jail for refusing to identify a news source.         Miss Torre, who shortened her last name from Torregrossa, was born in Brooklyn. She joined the Herald Tribune staff in 1955. As a radio and television columnist in 1957, she quoted a CBS executive, whom she did not name, as saying that Judy Garland was balking about doing a CBS special ''because she thinks she is terribly fat.''         Miss Garland sued the network for $1.39 million, and Miss Torre, as a witness in a pretrial hearing, was ordered by the court to disclose the name of her source. She refused, arguing that a reporter should not be compelled to reveal sources in court because such an order violated the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.         ''She never revealed his name, even to members of our family,'' Mr. Lopez said yesterday.         Judge Sylvester Ryan of Federal District Court in Manhattan warned her that she could be jailed for contempt of court. When she again refused, he sentenced her to 10 days in jail. The case drew attention and support from news organizations.         Miss Torre, with The Herald Tribune's backing, appealed the sentence, but it was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals in New York. In his opinion, Judge Potter Stewart, who later served on the United States Supreme Court, conceded that ''compulsory disclosure of a journalist's confidential sources of information may entail an abridgment of press freedom.'' But he added that ''the duty of a witness to testify in a court of law has roots as deep as the guarantee of a free press.'' He held that Miss Torre must yield ''to a paramount public interest in the fair administration of justice.''         The Supreme Court refused to review the decision, but Miss Garland did not pursue the case once Miss Torre's jail term ended.         Miss Torre did a radio talk show in Wilmington, Del., until August, when she was hospitalized.         She is survived by a daughter, Roma Torre of Manhattan, a news anchorwoman; a son, Adam Jeffrey Friedman of Los Angeles; a brother, John Torregrossa of Panama City, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, died on Monday night at a nursing home in Southampton, England. She was 100.         Karen Kamuda, the vice president of the Titanic Historical Society, said  in a telephone interview today from Indian Orchard, Mass., that Mrs. Haisman's death left 7 of the 705 survivors still living, 3 in the United States and 2 each in Britain and France.         Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.         She was a guest of honor last August on a pilgrimage cruise to the spot 400 miles off the Newfoundland coast where the liner, on its maiden voyage, hit an iceberg on the night of  April 14-15, 1912.         In 1995 she took part in the opening of a memorial garden at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, with a granite monument commemorating the victims, and in 1993 she appeared in public in Southampton to receive a gold watch thought to be her father's from the head of the American company that had salvaged it from the wreckage.         She had last seen the watch protruding from the waistcoat pocket of her father, Thomas William Solomon Brown, 60, a hotel owner from Worcester, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. He was taking his wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter Edith to Seattle, where he intended to open a new hotel. In the hold of the cruise liner were tableware, furnishings and 1,000 rolls of bed linen for the new enterprise.         In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography, ''A Lifetime on the Titanic,'' published in 1995, Mrs. Haisman gave a vivid account of the ship's final moments, although some details have been called into question.         Mrs. Haisman said she remembered that her father was dressed in an Edwardian dinner jacket, stabbing the cold night air with his cigar and sipping from a snifter of brandy on the deck of the listing ship as she and her mother were being winched 70 feet down into a lifeboat.         Mrs. Haisman said that she never forgot the horror of that night and the loss of her father and that even in her later years she suffered nightmares in which she heard the screaming of the drowning victims in the Atlantic. It was 11:40 P.M. when she recalled being jolted in her three-berth stateroom. ''Father appeared a few minutes later,'' she recalled. ''He told us: 'You'd better put on your life jackets and something warm, it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. We've struck an iceberg -- it's nothing much. The steward in the corridor says it's nothing to worry about.' ''         They hurried through the corridors, leaving behind in their haste her mother's jewelry case, 400 gold sovereigns and a roll of bank notes on top of a bunk. ''We waited for ages on the boat deck for someone to tell us what to do. The ship's band was playing ragtime. They played to keep our spirits up. It was so brave of them. Everybody kept saying: 'She's unsinkable. She won't go down.'         ''Father kissed us and saw us into Lifeboat 14. Up to 50 people got in as it swung perilously over the side. One man jumped into the boat dressed as a woman. As we rowed away from the ship, we could still hear the band playing, but now it was hymns.'' She watched the mighty liner go down.  ''We were almost six hours in the lifeboat and during that time we had  no water and nothing to eat. I kept wondering if my father had got off the ship -- that's all I could think of.''         She and her mother were picked up by the Cunard liner Carpathia and taken to New York, where they left on a train trip to Seattle to spend time with an aunt of Mrs. Haisman's, who lived there and had inspired the move to the West Coast. They soon returned to South Africa, where five years later Edith married Fred Haisman, a shipbuilder's engineering draftsman from London.         Married for 60 years, the couple lived in South Africa, Australia and Southampton, where Mr. Haisman worked in the boatyard. They had 10  children.         Ms. Kamuda, of the Titanic Historical Society, said Mrs. Haisman had ''elaborated'' her story over the years, adding details about what her father was wearing, for example.         ''This is not a criticism of Mrs. Haisman,'' Ms. Kamuda said. ''On the contrary it is only to point out how our memories fail us as time passes and numerous outside influences shape our lives.''         Mrs. Haisman did not share the concern of some survivors and many curators and historians over efforts to salvage mementos from the wreck and to raise parts of the ship itself. The 18-carat pocket watch that she said was her father's had been found in a purser's black leather portmanteau during a dive in 1987.         R. M. S. Titanic of Southport, Conn., the company that exhibits artifacts from the ship and that has drawn charges of exploiting the disaster from Ms. Kamuda and others, had the watch attached to a sterling silver plate inscribed with the words, ''What better use for scientific technology than to reunite a father with his child.'' The chairman of the company, George Tulloch, presented it to Mrs. Haisman in Southampton in December 1993.         By her bed in the nursing home stood a photograph of her father in a straw boater, stiff collar and bowtie.         Mrs. Haisman was born on Oct. 27, 1896. She is survived by four sons, two daughters and more than 30 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Casey Miller, a writer and editor who was a pioneering advocate of nonsexist language, died on Sunday at her home in East Haddam, Conn. She was 77.         Kate Swift, her close friend and co-author, said the cause of death was chronic obstructive lung disease.         Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift co-wrote numerous books and articles on English usage and its relationship to the status of women. Writing in a climate of increasing sensitivity and opposition to language that relegated women to secondary status, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift waged a forceful campaign against what many considered sexist language. If not all their proposals (like ''genkind'' to replace mankind) found their way into everyday usage, the women nonetheless helped to raise awareness of oppression by language.         Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift were the authors of ''Words and Women,'' published in 1976 by Doubleday and 1991 by HarperCollins, and ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing,'' published in 1980 by Lippincott & Crowell and in 1988 by HarperCollins. They also wrote many articles on sexism in English that appeared in national periodicals and in more than 30 anthologies and textbooks.         They achieved widespread recognition as authorities on the subject of linguistic disparagement of women with ''One Small Step for Genkind,'' a 1972 article in The New York Times Magazine that was reprinted in college textbooks as recently as last year.         In it, they wrote: ''Except for words that refer to females by definition (mother, actress, Congresswoman), and words for occupations traditionally held by females (nurse, secretary, prostitute), the English language defines everyone as male. The hypothetical person (''If a man can walk 10 miles in two hours . . . ), the average person (''the man in the street'') and the active person (''the man on the move'') are male. The assumption is that unless otherwise identified, people in general -- including doctors and beggars -- are men.         ''It is a semantic mechanism that operates to keep women invisible; man and mankind represent everyone; he in generalized use refers to either sex; the ''land where our fathers died'' is also the land of our mothers -- although they go unsung. As the beetle-browed and mustachioed man in a Steig cartoon says to his two male drinking companions, 'When I speak of mankind, one thing I don't mean is womankind.' ''         Ms. Swift said yesterday that the idea for the article grew out of their first collaboration as editors in 1970, on a sex education handbook for high schools that talked about the nature of man and man's behavior and used the pronoun ''he'' in ways that made it impossible to know whether the author was writing about both males and females or only about males.         ''We began to think this was a field that needed to be written about and explored,'' Ms. Swift said.         Their articles on the subject first appeared in New York magazine and in the first issue of Ms. magazine. The New York Times Magazine article appeared on April 16, 1972, and  ''got an awful lot of negative comment,'' Ms. Swift said.         Casey Geddes Miller was born on Feb. 26, 1919, in Toledo, Ohio. She received a bachelor of arts degree in 1940 from Smith College, where she was a philosophy major. During World War II, she served for three years in the Navy, working in Washington in naval intelligence.         She was on the staff of Colonial Williamsburg from 1947 to 1954, when she became the curriculum editor of the publishing house of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press. Ten years later, she became a freelance editor, working at her home in Greenwich and after 1967 in East Haddam, where she formed her editorial partnership with Ms. Swift.         She is survived by her sisters, Kate R. Gregg of Falmouth, Me., and Caroline S. Cooper of Gilmanton, N.H.       
         Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu, a physicist who performed a historic experiment overturning what had been considered a fundamental law of nature, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Dr. Luke C. L. Yuan, a retired experimental physicist.         Dr. Wu, the Michael I. Pupin Professor Emeritus of Physics at Columbia University, where she carried out research and taught for 37 years, was known throughout her career as a meticulously accurate experimental physicist who was in demand to put new theories to the test.         In her most famous experiment, announced in 1957, she and her colleagues overthrew a law of symmetry in physics called the principle of conservation of parity that had been considered incontrovertible for 30 years. It held that in nuclear reactions, nature in effect does not differentiate between left and right. At one time, physicists were so certain of the validity of the law that they tried to make all of their observations fit it.         But Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, also of Columbia, and Dr. Chen Ning Yang of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., suggested that conservation of parity did not hold for interactions between subatomic particles involving the so-called weak force. (One of the four basic forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force plays a role in radioactive decay.)         Dr. Lee consulted with Dr. Wu, an expert in radioactive beta decay, in which an atom emits electrons. Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang suggested an experiment, but Dr. Wu had to find a way to carry it out, an extremely difficult challenge with the technology available at the time.         The experiment used cobalt 60 cooled to 0.01 degree above absolute zero (or minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). Dr. Wu joined forces with a research team at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, which had one of the few laboratories in the country that could chill materials to extremely low temperatures.         The cobalt 60, a radioactive isotope, was placed in a strong electromagnetic field, which made all the cobalt nuclei line up so they spun along the same axis.         Dr. Wu measured what happened when the cobalt nuclei broke down, giving off electrons. She used a device that counted the number of particles that shot out in the direction of the spin and those that did not.         If the law of conservation of parity was correct, the nuclei would give off equal numbers of particles in each direction. But Dr. Wu found that far more particles flew off in the direction opposite the spin of the nuclei, proving that nature differentiates between left and right.         The results were confirmed by other experiments.         Dr. Isador I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate in physics at Columbia, said at the time, ''In a certain sense, a rather complete theoretical structure has been shattered at the base, and we are not sure how the pieces will be put together.''         Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their theoretical work in this area. Dr. Wu did not share the prize, but the playwright Clare Boothe Luce said at the time, ''When Dr. Wu knocked out that principle of parity, she established the principle of parity between men and women.''         Dr. Lee said yesterday, ''C. S. Wu was one of the giants of physics.''         Dr. Wu was born on May 29, 1912, near Shanghai. She received a bachelor's degree from National Central University in Nanjing in 1936 and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1940.         She taught at Smith College and Princeton University before being asked to join the Manhattan Project, the Army's secret project to develop the atomic bomb in World War II. She helped develop a process to enrich uranium ore that produced large quantities of uranium 235, a fuel for the bomb.         As part of the project, an atomic pile was built at Hanford, Wash., in 1942, but its chain reaction stopped a few hours after it was started. The physicist Enrico Fermi suspected that a substance produced by nuclear fission was halting the reaction by capturing most of the neutrons.         He was reportedly told, ''Ask Miss Wu.'' It turned out that a rare gas that she had studied in graduate school was responsible, and the problem was cleared up.         After the war Dr. Wu joined Columbia as a research associate. She was named a full professor in 1958 and was appointed the first Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973.         In her research, she obtained the first successful measurements of low-energy electrons emitted by beta decay, providing experimental evidence for Fermi's theory of weak interactions in the nucleus. She was an author of ''Beta Decay,'' published in 1965, a standard reference for nuclear physicists.         In 1975 Dr. Wu became the first woman to be elected president of the American Physical Society, the chief organization of physicists in the United States. She was also the first woman to receive the Cyrus B. Comstock Award of the National Academy of Sciences and the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate in science from Princeton. The university's president, Robert F. Goheen, said in presenting it in 1958 that Dr. Wu had ''richly earned the right to be called the world's foremost female experimental physicist.''         She also received the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for achievement in science, and the Wolf Prize in physics. Dr. Wu was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh as an honorary fellow.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Vincent Yuan, of Albuquerque, N.M., who is a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.       
         Katharine Winthrop McKean, an outstanding amateur tennis player of the 1930's and 1940's, died on Feb. 12 at her home in Hamilton, Mass. She was 82.         Mrs. McKean won four national junior girls' tennis titles, playing out of Boston, and five national women's titles, in indoors singles and doubles. She was named to the New England Tennis Hall of Fame in 1990.         She was a doubles partner of Alice Marble at Wimbledon in 1936 and toured South America in the years before World War II with Sarah Palfrey, Jack Kramer and Bobby Riggs.         Mrs. McKean was also active in horse racing and golf. She and her husband, Quincy Adams Shaw McKean, who died in 1971, owned thoroughbred horses.         A native of Ipswich, Mass., she was a descendant of John Winthrop, the first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.         She is survived by four sons, John, of Beverly, Mass., and Pinehurst, N.C.; Thomas, of Concord, Mass.; Robert, of Dedham, Mass., and David, of Washington; two stepsons, Shaw, of Rumson, N.J., and Harry, of Vero Beach, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Margaret Vernon, of Hamilton, Mass., and seven grandchildren.       
         Nora Beloff, a gifted political writer and foreign correspondent who was a trailblazer among women in British journalism, died on Feb. 12. She was 78 and a longtime resident of London.         She had a short illness, said The Associated Press, which reported her death on Feb. 15. The place of her death was not immediately disclosed.         Miss Beloff worked for the national weekly newspaper The Observer from 1948 to 1978. After her death, a former editor of The Observer, Donald Trelford, wrote in The Guardian that she was ''the first female political correspondent of a major British newspaper'' and ''had one of the most distinguished careers any woman has had in British journalism.''         She was The Observer's political correspondent from 1964 to 1976 after being its correspondent in Paris, Washington and Moscow, and also worked as a freelance writer.         At different times, she was expelled from the Soviet Union and from Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Harold Wilson tried in vain to have her dismissed from The Observer after her aggressive reporting about disunity in his Labor Government.         The first of her five books, ''The General Says No: Britain's Exclusion from Europe'' (1963) was praised in a review in The New York Times Book Review by Drew Middleton, then The Times's Paris bureau chief. He said the book ''abounds in clear analyses of complicated situations and in sharp, enduring pictures of persons and situations.''         Miss Beloff was born in London  and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Oxford. She was in the political intelligence department of the British Foreign Office in London from 1941 to 1944 and on the staff of British Embassy in Paris in 1944 and 1945.         Turning to journalism, she became a reporter for Reuters in Paris in 1945 and 1946 and Paris correspondent of The Economist from 1946 to 1948. She was a roving correspondent for The Observer from 1976 to 1978.         She married Clifford Makins, former sports editor of The Observer, in 1977. He died in 1990.       
         Elizabeth Rudel Gatov, a wealthy California businesswoman who was long active in Democratic politics and served briefly as Treasurer of the United States, died on Jan. 25 at her home in Kentfield, Calif., near San Francisco. She was 85.         Mrs. Gatov was Elizabeth Rudel Smith -- she had just divorced Frederick H. Smith, a San Francisco businessman when, as a Democratic national committeewoman from California, she was appointed Treasurer in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.         She resigned in April 1962 to return to California politics and helped fellow Democrats that year thwart Richard M. Nixon's initial bid for a political comeback, in the race for governor. She also rejoined the Democratic National Committee, where she remained until 1965.         Mrs. Gatov was born in Montreal, the daughter of a Canadian-American industrialist. She attended Smith College and graduated in 1937 from the University of Michigan.         She was married four times and widowed three times. Her last husband, Albert W. Gatov, a California businessman and former Government official, died in 1978.         She is survived by a daughter, Jane Jackson of Oakland, Calif.; a son, Daniel Smith of Kentfield; four granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.       
         Dorothy Fosdick, the foreign policy expert who helped fashion the United Nations, the Marshall Plan and NATO in the 1940's, advised Adlai E. Stevenson in the 1952 Presidential campaign and then spent nearly three decades as Senator Henry M. Jackson's chief cold war strategist, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Washington. She was 83 and had continued to live in Washington after Senator Jackson's death in 1983.         Her sister, Elinor Downs, said the cause was cardiac arrest.         From the early months of World War II, when the United States began  planning for the postwar world, until President Reagan opened the final phase of the struggle against the Soviet Union with his ''evil empire'' speech in 1983, Dr. Fosdick was in the thick of national foreign policy planning and debate.         Along the way, she consistently took such a hard line against the Soviet Union and was such a passionate and articulate advocate of military might that her colleagues sometimes had to remind themselves that she was, in fact, the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, the pacifist pastor of Riverside Church, the Rockefeller-backed bastion of New York liberalism.         Whatever her father's influence,  Dr. Fosdick, who was born in Montclair, N.J., and grew up in the faculty housing at the Union Theological Seminary, took as her mentor the family's friend and neighbor, Reinhold Niebuhr, the theologian whose belief that evil is a palpable world force that must be resisted and overcome became the geopolitical creed of a generation of cold war theorists.         Dr. Fosdick's career was also influenced by her beloved Uncle Raymond, her father's brother, Raymond B. Fosdick, an international lawyer whose appointment as Under Secretary of the League of Nations came to naught after the Senate failed to ratify the founding treaty.         She took the rejection of the treaty as a personal affront and later wrote a prize-winning essay on the episode at the Horace Mann School, then went off to Smith College, where she was an acclaimed athlete. After obtaining a doctorate in public law from Columbia University, she taught sociology and political theory.         Her academic career came to an end early in 1942, when she was recruited by the State Department's opaquely named Division of Special Research and was assigned to begin planning for a postwar international organization.         Over the next few years, she helped shape the Dumbartron Oaks and San Francisco conferences, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, served on the delegations to both conferences and attended the early sessions of the U.N.         Her contributions were so impressive that in 1948 at the age of 34, she became the only woman on the State Department's newly formed Policy Planning Staff, a high-level, in-house think tank of nine strategic planners whose work under George Kennan and later Paul Nitze helped shape the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.         During the 1952 Presidential campaign, Dr. Fosdick became so enamored with the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, that she became his chief foreign policy adviser and had a romantic fling with him (at the same time, she later learned, that Stevenson was having a secret affair with Alicia Patterson.)         Stevenson apparently disappointed her on both fronts. Dr. Fosdick, who never married, mainly, her sister suggested, because she never found a man her equal, later confided to friends that she did not think Stevenson had the gumption to be President.         After a period as a freelance writer, Dr. Fosdick, whose books included, ''What is Liberty?'' and ''Common Sense and World Affairs,'' finally found her niche in 1954 as chief foreign policy adviser to Senator Jackson, the Washington State Democrat known for his expertise in military affairs.         Sharing both his passion for liberal social causes and his commitment to a strong military, Dr. Fosdick became the Senator's alter ego. She wrote his speeches, helped develop his strategic positions and political initiatives and orchestrated his legendary informational hearings. Her 1961 report, for example, after a quiet, thorough investigation of cold war policy procedures became the blueprint for President John F. Kennedy's reorganization of the national security policy apparatus.         At a time when Senator Jackson was a Senate legend for the quality of his staff, Dr. Fosdick was in command of the ''bunker,'' so called partly because of the cramped staff quarters and partly because Senator Jackson and his staff were so often at odds with the prevailing political winds of detente.         Dr. Fosdick, known as Dickie and sometimes referred to as the bunker's bubbie, the Yiddish word for grandmother, was an exacting boss, one whose day could be ruined by a misplaced comma.         A slim, peppery woman who had been a fierce competitor on the Horace Mann and Smith athletic fields, Dr. Fosdick was only 5-foot-1, but more than one bulky senator felt her sting. When Dr. Fosdick went toe-to-toe, eyeball-to-tie clasp on a cherished issue, she would punctuate her arguments with rapid finger gestures that often peppered a senatorial paunch.         In time, Dr. Fosdick was eclipsed on the public stage by some of her  admiring young proteges, among them Ricard N. Perle, who became an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Elliott Abrams, who became an Assistant Secretary of State, but only, perhaps, because she preferred to work behind the scenes.         As Mrs. Downs put it, recalling that her sister had turned down repeated offers to become an ambassador or college president: ''She had no personal ambition. She only wanted to save the world.''         In addition to Mrs. Downs, of Boston, Dr. Fosdick is survived by a niece, Patricia Berger of Brookline, Mass., a nephew, Stephen Downs of Albany; two grand-nephews, and three grand-nieces.       
         Judi Bari, an environmentalist whose passionate defense of the California redwoods earned her national prominence and who was injured in a car bombing that might have been related to her protests, died on Sunday at her cabin home in Willits, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bari emerged on the national scene in the summer of 1990. Working with the radical environmental group Earth First, she helped organize a seasonlong campaign of protests to stop the logging of Northern California's old-growth forests.         She and other Earth First members, some outfitted in spotted-owl costumes and camouflage, spent weeks chaining themselves to redwoods and pleading with loggers to spare the groves. In the process, Ms. Bari, a confident orator, helped present a coherent message for a group with a reputation as an overzealous fringe organization.         She called on college students statewide to join the protests, evoking the civil rights spirit that had been used in the summer of 1964 to draw student protesters to the South.         As tensions rose between protesters and loggers, Ms. Bari emerged as a more moderate voice on the environmentalist side. She emphasized that protests opposed the actions of corporations, not their employees, and renounced the use of sabotage methods like ''spiking'' trees with ten-inch nails to destroy saws, which had seriously injured at least one millworker.         Her outspokenness earned her the scorn of many lumber workers, and she received several anonymous death threats.         In May 1990, an explosion ripped through Ms. Bari's car as she and Darryl Cherney, a fellow Earth First member, drove through Oakland, Calif., shortly before planned anti-logging protests. The blast, later determined to have been caused by a nail bomb under the driver's seat, shattered Ms. Bari's pelvis and lower back and left her permanently disabled. Mr. Cherney's injuries were minor.         Shortly after the explosion, while Ms. Bari was still in the hospital, the F.B.I. and local law-enforcement officials put Ms. Bari and Mr. Cherney under arrest, saying they suspected the two had built the bomb. Supporters of the two contended that either the timber industry or Government officials were responsible.         Two months later, the authorities announced that Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari would not be charged with the bombing. They later filed suit against the Government claiming false arrest and civil rights violations. That suit is still in progress in Oakland, Calif.         Ms. Bari was born in Baltimore in 1949. In the late 1960's, as a student at the University of Maryland, she became involved in protests against the Vietnam War and left school.         In the next decade, Ms. Bari held a variety of jobs in the Washington area, where she was also a labor organizer. In the mid-1970's, she planned a successful wildcat strike of workers at a bulk mail office of the United States Postal Service in Washington, as well as failed effort to unionize grocery clerks.         In 1979, she relocated to Northern California, where she worked as a carpenter.         In interviews after the bombing, she recounted how she had a ''environmental epiphany'' one day while working. Admiring a piece of knot-free siding for a house, she said, she wondered aloud whether the wood was old-growth redwood. Her supervisor blithely said it was from a redwood about 1,000 years old.         ''A light bulb went on: We are cutting down old-growth forests to make yuppie houses,'' she said. ''I became obsessed with the forests.''         Ms. Bari is survived by her daughters, Lisa, 16, and Jessica, 11; her parents, Arthur and Ruth Bari, of Silver Spring, Md., and two sisters, Gina Kolata, of Princeton, N.J., a reporter at The New York Times, and Martha Bari of Silver Spring.       
         Leanne Katz, who served as executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship since its creation more than 20 years ago, died at her New York home Sunday, after a three-year battle with cancer. She was 65.         As a defender of free speech, Ms. Katz worked with teachers, librarians and authors across the country to fight the banning of books, magazines, movies and art.         Ms. Katz worked on dozens of cases each year in which principals or school boards had removed books from classrooms or libraries because they disapproved of the content. Among the authors whose works Ms. Katz defended -- sometimes repeatedly -- are Judy Blume, Maurice Sendak, Nancy Friday, V. C. Andrews, Katherine Paterson, Ken Follett, Madeleine L'Engle, Chris Durang, Dorothy Allison and Robert Cormier -- in addition to Mark Twain and Geoffrey Chaucer.         Ms. Blume, a popular children's author whose books dealing frankly with adolescent sexuality have frequently been the targets of censorship, said: ''When my books were being banned early on, in the 80's, I had nowhere to go, until I found this remarkable woman, this tiny dynamo who had such passion and energy for fighting censorship. From then on, if I had word from a teacher, a librarian, or a newspaper anywhere in the country that something was being banned, all I had to do was put this person in touch with Leanne, and I knew she would instantly respond and get them through this, let them know they were not alone. She believed in the First Amendment above all.''         Recently, Ms. Blume said, Ms. Katz had been distressed about what seemed to be an increasing tendency not just to remove controversial books from use, but to dismiss the teacher or librarian who chose them.         The coalition Ms. Katz headed was created in 1974, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Miller v. California, which broadened the reach of censorship, allowing the banning of any work that lacked ''serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.''         The coalition is an alliance of 45 religious, artistic, educational and civil liberties groups ranging from Actors' Equity to the American Library Association and the National Council of the Churches of Christ, and it began as a project of the American Civil Liberties Union, but soon became a separate entity.         The coalition acted as an advocate against proposed legislation, national or local, that would restrict free speech. Roz Udow, the coalition's director of education and public affairs, said it worked on more than a hundred individual cases a year, most of them involving efforts to ban works because their content is considered sexual, profane -- as is becoming increasingly common -- a reference to Satan.         ''There isn't a book in the library that somebody hasn't tried to censor,'' Ms. Udow said. ''There have always been a lot of cases about sexual content, and currently the major topics of concern seem to be homosexuality, witchcraft and the occult.''         Throughout the 1990's, Ms. Katz has been a central figure in the debate over whether pornography harms women. Some feminists, including Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, believe that pornography is inextricably connected to discrimination and violence against women, but Ms. Katz organized other leading feminists to argue that free expression about sexuality is a feminist value and that censorship has harmed women in the past by suppressing information about sexuality and birth control.         Before she began working with the censorship coalition, Ms. Katz was on the national staff of the American Civil Liberties Union, as liaison to the group's affiliates. Ms. Katz served as a consultant for Human Rights Watch, the National Council of Teachers of English and the Modern Language Association. She taught courses on free expression at Queens College of the City University of New York and the New School of Social Research, and wrote and lectured widely on freedom of expression.         She is survived by her husband, Alvin M. Katz, her sons, Joseph and Jamie, and her sister Sara Blackburn.         A memorial service will be held at a date to be announced.       
         Alice Sachs, a retired Commissioner of Elections for Manhattan and an abiding presence in Democratic reform politics, died on Saturday at the Hallmark Nursing Centre in North Granville, N.Y. She was 91 and had lived for many years at the Barbizon Hotel on the Upper East Side.         Miss Sachs retired in 1993 after 20 years on the Board of Elections. While Manhattan Democratic Commissioner, she held terms as president and secretary of the board.         She helped introduce programs intended to make elections less cumbersome, including the retraining of workers, computerized back-office operations, revamped voter registration database and installation of a citywide electronic voting system.         Born in Kansas City, Mo., Miss Sachs was raised on Long Island, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College and received a certificate in education at the Sorbonne. She translated French art books and worked as an editor at Crown Publishing from 1937 until her retirement in 1989.         But her avocations were civic affairs and politics. She took on Tammany Hall and repeatedly ran for the State Legislature in Republican territory. She was a founder of the executive committee of the Lexington Democratic Club, a State Committeewoman, co-leader of the 73d Assembly District and an officer of Community Planning Board 8.         She was a delegate to three Presidential nominating conventions and a member of the Electoral College that chose Jimmy Carter for President. She was national vice chairman of Americans for Democratic Action and was active in the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, the League of Women Voters, B'nai B'rith and the Urban League.         She is survived by a brother, Robert Sachs of West Granville, N.Y.       
         Helen Bernstein, a former president of the Los Angeles teachers union known for her forceful style and dogged support of higher standards for students and a decentralized administration, died here Thursday night. She was 52 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bernstein was hit by a car as she crossed a street on the way to a speaking engagement, the police said.         At the time of her death, she was education adviser to Mayor Richard J. Riordan, director of a national urban school reform organization, and a candidate in Tuesday's local election for a commission that will help rewrite the city charter.         Ms. Bernstein's tenure as president of the United Teachers-Los Angeles from 1990 to 1996 was marked by a pay cut for teachers and the decentralization of administrative control in what is the nation's second-largest school district. The union has about 30,000 members.         During Ms. Bernstein's presidency, Los Angeles schools were under scrutiny for low student test scores, scarce funding, and a teachers union that was considered prone to strike.         In 1989, as union vice president, Ms. Bernstein helped negotiate a settlement ending a nine-day strike that  gave teachers a 24 percent raise over three years. The increase was cut a few years later as the district neared fiscal collapse.         Jeff Horton, president of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Board of Education, said that he frequently clashed with Ms. Bernstein. He described her as a ''fighter,'' ''energetic'' and critical of the school establishment, but also a positive force in the district.         In November, Ms. Bernstein became the Mayor's first education adviser. Day Higuchi, the current union president, credited her with persuading the Mayor to support a school bond issue to replace some deteriorating city school property.         Ms. Bernstein is survived by her daughter, Jessica, a graduate student at University of California at Berkeley; her mother, Sara Sherman of Los Angeles, and three brothers, Alan and Victor, both of Los Angeles, and Sheldon, of San Diego.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Nancy J. Woodhull, the first managing editor for news at USA Today and a champion of women and diversity in the newsroom and in news coverage, died yesterday at her home in Pittsford, N.Y., near Rochester. She was 52.         The cause of death was cancer, said Gene Policinski, a special assistant at the Freedom Forum, where Ms. Woodhull was senior vice president for communications. The Freedom Forum, a nonprofit organization established by the Gannett Company in Arlington, Va., addresses issues involving the First Amendment, free press and free speech.         Ms. Woodhull was also vice chairwoman of the International Women's Media Foundation and chairwoman of the Peabody Radio and Television Awards. She was a former president of the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., and, with Betty Friedan, a founding chairwoman of Women, Men and Media, a national organization that monitors the coverage of women in the media.         ''A free press in a democracy should reflect all its voices,'' Ms. Woodhull said last year after a survey by Women, Men and Media concluded that although women made up 52 percent of the nation's population, they were the subject of only 15 percent of front-page newspaper articles. ''None should be invisible. The press needs to focus on this trend toward the invisibility of women and their concerns.''         Ms. Woodhull, who was born in Perth Amboy, N.J., attended Trenton State Teachers College before beginning her newspaper career as an editor with The News Tribune in Woodbridge, N.J., in 1964. Later, she was a reporter for The Detroit Free Press and then was managing editor of the Gannett papers in Rochester, The Times-Union and The Democrat and Chronicle.         After serving as managing editor for news when USA Today was started by Gannett in 1982, she became the newspaper's senior editor and then was the president of Gannett New Media and the Gannett News Service. She resigned in 1990 and became executive vice president and editor in chief of the Southern Progress Corporation, an arm of Time Warner, with responsibility for overseeing the editorial direction of the magazines Southern Living, Progressive Farmer, Southern Accents, Travel South and Cooking Light.         In 1992 Ms. Woodhull became a trustee of the Freedom Forum, and in 1996 she became a senior vice president and executive director of the Media Studies Center, a unit of the Freedom Forum that focuses on media issues and journalism research.         Ms. Woodhull is survived by her husband, William Watson, and a daughter, Tennessee Jane Watson, both of Pittsford, and her mother, May Cromwell, of Matawan, N.J.       
         Mary French Rockefeller, the wife of Laurance S. Rockefeller and for more than four decades active in promoting leadership opportunities for women, died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Thursday from injuries she suffered in a fall in her Manhattan apartment. She was 86, and a family spokesman said she had been in failing health for several years.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a dedicated supporter of the Young Women's Christian Association, where she took a prominent role as an advocate for women throughout the world. She began in 1951 as a member of the national board and in 1988 was elected to the Board of Trustees. From 1955 to 1973, she was vice chairman and then chairman of the Y.W.C.A.'s International division, and from 1958 to 1964, she was chairman of the organization's World Service Council. In the early 1960's, both Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller traveled more than 50,000 miles to study Y.W.C.A. activities around the world.         In addition to her work with the Y.W.C.A., Mrs. Rockefeller was active in many educational, cultural and religious organizations. She was a trustee of Spelman College in Atlanta for nearly 25 years, a trustee of the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Mass., and the Whitney Museum of American Art and, in 1972, was chairman of the Y's National Convocation on Racial Justice.         She was, too, a member of the Distribution Committee of the New York Community Trust and the Women's Administrative board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Mrs. Rockefeller was the daughter of John French and Mary Billing French and granddaughter of Frederick Billings, the 19th-century president of Northern Pacific Railroad. She attended Vassar College and, in 1934, married Mr. Rockefeller, the fourth of the six children of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and a grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of the Standard Oil Company.         In 1992, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller donated her family home and surrounding property in Woodstock, Vt., to the Federal Government for development as the state's first national park.         She is survived by her husband and four children, Laura R. Chasin of Cambridge, Mass., Marion R. Weber of San Francisco, Lucy R. Waletzky of Pleasantville, N.Y., and Laurance (Larry) Rockefeller of Manhattan. There are nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Ann Petry, who took a single stretch of Harlem and brought it vividly and disturbingly to life in her acclaimed 1946 novel, ''The Street,'' died on Monday at a convalescent center near her home in Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 88.         So much has been written about the hard life on the the mean streets of Harlem, it may seem surprising that the first major literary work to focus on that life would be a first novel by a woman who not only had not grown up there but whose exposure to Harlem street culture had been limited to nine months working with an experimental after-school program on West 116th Street.         But then Ann Lane Petry was a surprising woman, one of such enormous empathy and imaginative flair that she did not need to encounter many bereft latchkey children, their desperate, beleaguered mothers or the assortment of opportunistic men who preyed on them to translate her observations into literature.         Half a century after ''The Street,'' was first published by Houghton-Mifflin, Mrs. Petry's creations, Ludie Johnson and her 8-year-old son Bub, are still regarded as among the more indelible characters of black literature.         One reason, perhaps, that Harlem street life had such a powerful impact on Mrs. Petry, was that it was so far removed from her own genteel upbringing. A native of Old Saybrook, where her father, Peter Lane, had opened a pharmacy in 1902, she grew up in one of the few black families in the white resort.         Several members of her mother's family were pharmacists, too, and in time Mrs. Petry graduated from the College of Pharmacy at the University of Connecticut and went to work at her father's store.         But ever since a high school teacher who did not like her had praised her work and said she could become a writer, she had been writing stories and, as she later put it, gathering rejection slips.         Her life began to change in 1938 when she married George Petry, a Louisiana-born resident of Harlem she had met while both were visiting friends in Hartford.         The couple settled in Harlem, and Mrs. Petry held a variety of jobs, including writing advertising copy for The Amsterdam News and working as a reporter and editor of the women's pages of The People's Voice, a weekly started by Adam Clayton Powell Jr.         When The Crisis, a magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, paid her $20 for one of her stories, ''On Saturday, the Sirens at Noon,'' it came to the attention of an editor at Houghton-Mifflin and led to both a $2,500 literary award and a contract for what became ''The Street.''         Mrs. Petry, who had written the book while her husband was in the service in World War II, was not quite prepared for the stir it created when it was published to both critical and popular acclaim. But ''The Street,'' which sold 1.5 million copies, gave Mrs. Petry the wherewithal to retreat back to Old Saybrook, where she and her husband settled in a 200-year-old sea captain's house and got an unlisted telephone number.         She followed ''The Street,'' with two other novels, ''Country Place,'' (1947) about about a serviceman who returns from the war to discover his wife is having an affair, and ''The Narrows,'' (1953) about an interracial affair.         Neither enjoyed the critical or commercial success of her first novel, however, and from then on Mrs. Petry, by then a mother, turned out books for children and young adults, among them two biographies, ''Tituba of Salem Village,'' and ''Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad.''         She also brought out a collection of her short stories, ''Legends of the Saints,'' but after its publication in 1970, she limited her output to articles for college journals and the like.         Mrs. Petry had to endure a fresh burst of fame in 1992 when ''The Street,'' was reissued in paperback to a new round of acclaim.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Elisabeth, of Cromwell, Conn.       
         Pupul Jayakar, who became known as India's ''czarina of culture'' when she melded her passion for Indian arts and handicrafts with a close and influential friendship with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, died on Friday at her home in Bombay, Indian press reports said. She was 81.         As a prominent figure in the women's movement that took part in India's struggle for independence from Britain, Mrs. Jayakar was a confidante of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister.         But it was her relationship with Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Gandhi, from the time both were teen-agers that helped her assume a dominant and controversial role in the nation's cultural affairs during the height of Mrs. Gandhi's power in the 1970's and early 80's. She was appointed adviser to the Prime Minister on heritage and cultural matters and given the rank of minister of state.         Abroad, Mrs. Jayakar was perhaps best known for her part in organizing a series of Indian arts festivals in the 1980's in France, the United States and Japan that were credited with popularizing Indian artistic achievements in the West. But it was at home that she made her most important mark, encouraging the revival of Indian arts, particularly weaving, handicrafts and village art.         Mrs. Jayakar outlived her husband, Manmohan Jayakar, a barrister, by 25 years. She remained active to the end of her life in some of India's most important cultural organizations, including the Crafts Museum in New Delhi, the Calico Museum of Textiles in Ahmedabad and the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, which she founded in 1984.         ''I can look back with satisfaction that I have lit a few lamps in this country,'' she said in an interview a few months before her death.       
         Eugenie M. Anderson, who in 1949 became the first woman appointed a United States Ambassador, died on Monday at her home in Red Wing, Minn. She was 87.         Mrs. Anderson had been active in the Democratic Party on the state and national levels when she was appointed Ambassador to Denmark  by President Truman.         Her interest in international affairs had been stirred by a trip to Europe in 1937, where in Germany she first saw a ''totalitarian state in action,'' as she recalled.         On her return she spoke frequently on foreign affairs on behalf of the League of Women Voters at a time when much of the Middle West was strongly committed to isolationist policies.         She joined the Democratic Party in part to oppose Republican isolationists in her election district and worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in the successful effort to eliminate a Communist faction within the Minnesota party. That effort culminated in the Democratic-Farmer Labor Party fusion in 1944.         She took part in the establishment of Americans for Democratic Action, formed by the party's anti-Communist liberal wing in 1947. She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948, a National Committeewoman, and a campaigner for the re-election of President Truman.         ''She was a prime force in moving along a good Democratic Party,'' said Orville Freeman, the former Minnesota Governor.         After her service in Denmark, President Kennedy appointed her in 1962 to head the American legation in Bulgaria, which was then a Communist ally of the Soviet Union.         The Government of Prime Minister Todor Zhivkov repeatedly made life uncomfortable for her mission, to the point of organizing a rock-throwing demonstration against the legation.         When the Bulgarian police tried to prevent her aides from passing out literature at the American display in the annual Plovdiv fair, Mrs. Anderson grabbed a handful of leaflets and distributed them herself.         She retired from the post as Ambassador in 1964.         President Johnson appointed Mrs. Anderson to represent the United States on the United Nations Trusteeship Council and a year later she served on the United Nations Committee for Decolonization.         Helen Eugenie Moore was born on May 26, 1909, in Adair, Iowa, one of five children of Rev. Ezekial A. Moore, a Methodist minister, and his wife, FloraBelle.         She concentrated in music as a student, and attended the Julliard School in New York; her original hope was to become a concert pianist.         She is survived by her husband of 67 years, John Pierce Anderson, an artist; a son, Dr. Hans P. Anderson of LaCrosse, Wis.; a daughter, Johanna A. Ghei of Madison, Wis.; six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ruth Sager, a geneticist who carried out influential research about the location of genetic material in cells, died on Saturday at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 79.         She had cancer of the bladder, said her husband, Dr. Arthur B. Pardee.         At her death, Dr. Sager was chief of cancer genetics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. She joined the institute's staff in 1975. She was also a professor of cellular genetics at the medical school from 1975 until she retired from that post in 1988 as a professor emerita.         Dr. Sager was widely known for research that altered the prevailing view about where genetic material was within the cell. That work began in the 1950's and came to fruition in the 1960's.         Dr. Charles D. Stiles, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Institute, said Dr. Sager had made a ''revolutionary discovery'' while doing research at the Rockefeller Institute, now Rockefeller University, and later at Columbia University. Before her research, Professor Stiles said, the view was widespread ''that all genetic information was sequestered in the nucleus of the cell.''         ''But what Ruth said,'' he added, ''was that important fragments of the genetic repertoire were located in the cell cytoplasm,'' outside the cell's nucleus in the cellular organelles where it does its respiration (and, in the case of plants, photosynthesis).         Dr. Lawrence Bogorad, the Maria Moors Cabot Professor of Biology emeritus at Harvard University, said the alterations that Dr. Sager achieved ''in the way people thought about extranuclear genetic material, that is, genes in the cell outside the nucleus,'' had proved to be highly significant.         ''These days, scientists know a lot about most of the genes in the organelles,'' Dr. Bogorad said. ''Increasing numbers of human diseases that result from mutations in genes in respiratory organelles are becoming recognized. These discoveries are direct results of the change of thinking about the problem that Ruth's work brought about.''         ''In the latter half of her career, Ruth turned her attention to problems in cancer and in human genetics,'' Dr. Stiles said. When Dr. Sager moved to the Dana-Farber Institute in 1975, he said, ''she quickly saw the potential of recombinant DNA technology, a technology that was then in its infancy'' and involves the manipulation of genetic material to explore basic biological questions.         ''Her main contribution at the institute was to recognize, quickly and early on, the potential and the power of cloning technology,'' he said.         Dr. Sager established the institute's division of cancer genetics and recruited able young scientists for its staff. Many of them have become prominent in genetics.         She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The honors she received included the  the Gilbert Morgan Smith Medal from the national academy, an Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Cancer Institute and a Guggenheim fellowship.         Dr. Sager was born in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree in 1938 from the University of Chicago and a doctorate in 1948 from Columbia. After becoming a senior research associate at Columbia, she was a professor at Hunter College from 1966 to 1975.         In addition to her husband, a professor emeritus of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the division of cell growth and regulation at the Dana-Farber Institute,  Dr. Sager is survived by two sisters, Esther Altschul of Wilmette, Ill., and Dr. Naomi Sager of Manhattan.       
         Judy Flannery, a late-blooming athlete who became an unlikely triathlon champion, was killed on Wednesday when she was struck by an automobile while on a bicycle-training ride near Poolesville, Md. A resident of Chevy Chase, she was was 57 and had won six American and four world age-group championships in the sport, which combines running, swimming and cycling.         According to the Montgomery County police, Ms. Flannery, who was nearing the midpoint of a 55-mile training ride with two friends, was killed when a car driven by an unlicensed 16-year-old driver swerved across the center line of the country road. The youth and his 38-year-old father, who was in the front passenger seat, received minor injuries. The police said yesterday that the incident was still under investigation and that no charges had been filed.         A native of Wilmington, Del., who graduated from the College of New Rochelle and worked as a biochemist before starting a family, Ms. Flannery grew up with a trim, athletic build in an age when girls were generally not welcome in athletics.         By the time her own four daughters were growing up, things were changing, especially at the Flannery household. Indeed, Ms. Flannery, who also had a son, spent so much time ferrying her brood to and from one athletic field or another that a daughter described her yesterday as ''the original soccer mom.''         Still, it was not until she was about 38, as she later recalled, that Ms. Flannery decided to find out what she had been missing.         ''I ran around the block,'' she said, and, as it happened, more or less kept on going: within a few years she was running marathons.         She might have stuck with distance running if a friend had not taken her to a triathlon one day. Immediately intrigued, Ms. Flannery, who was particularly attracted to the cycling phase, began training for the triathlon.         She was 47, and many of the women in the sport had been competing for decades, but within four years Ms. Flannery had pulled ahead of those in her age group.         She won the first of her six consecutive national championships in 1991, captured the first of her four world titles in 1992 and was so dominant in the United States that when she placed second last weekend in a race in Birmingham, Ala., the 55-year-old woman who beat her was described as stunned. No wonder. It was Ms. Flannery's first loss in a national age-group competition in six years.         Her proficiency as well as her popularity helps explain why the sport's national governing body, USA Triathlon, named her last month as the Master Female Triathlete of the Year.         A powerful runner who held her own in swimming, Ms. Flannery proved especially adept at cycling, so much so that she won five national age-group titles in time trials.         Although triathlons are staged over a varied combination of distances -- a mile swim, a 25-mile bicycle race and a 6.2-mile run in championship events, for example -- Ms. Flannery did not abandon her old sport of marathoning altogether. She competed three times in the grueling Hawaiian Ironman triathlon, which includes a full, 26.2-mile marathon, once placing second in her age group.         As enthusiastic about her sport as she was proficient in it, Ms. Flannery, a bubbly woman with a perpetual smile, was an accomplished recruiter who charmed thousands of women into taking up the sport while serving as chairwoman of the women's commission of USA Triathlon.         She was also an athlete of such uncommon modesty that she was never known to mention her victories. Those she had befriended and brought into the sport were inevitably startled to learn that the woman who had recruited them was a perennial champion.         For all the time she spent training and competing, Ms. Flannery was a regular volunteer at a local soup kitchen, but when it came to charity she preferred something a bit more robust. At the time of her death, for example, she and three cycling teammates were preparing to raise money to combat domestic violence by taking part in this summer's 3,000-mile Ride Across America.         Ms. Flannery is survived by her husband, Dennis; a son, Dennis, of Washington; four daughters, Erin of Santa Monica, Calif., Kelly of Collegeville, Pa., and Shannon and Megan, both of Washington, and a brother, David Sysko, of Wilmington.       
         Rebecca Shulman, who devoted a lifetime to Jewish and Israeli causes, most of all through Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 100.         She served three terms as national president of the large volunteer agency, from 1953 to 1956. She also held virtually every other major office in Hadassah, which was founded in 1912 and grew into the world's largest Zionist organization. She became active in it in 1929.         A trained nurse, she took particular interest in the medical aspects of Hadassah's work. She was a past chairman of the building fund for the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center and chairman of the Hadassah Medical Organization, one of the Mideast's largest medical care and research institutions.         The Hadassah Medical Organization comprises, besides Hadassah-Hebrew University Center, the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem and 10 other medical school, institutes and health care centers.         Mrs. Shulman became a nurturing presence in Israel from its birth.         In 1945, as chairman of Hadassah's national convention, she called on its 150,000 members to take up the struggle for Jewish statehood. In the next year, she visited Palestine to assess Hadassah's services amid a flood refugees from Europe.         In 1947, she helped David Ben-Gurion, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, break ground for a new Hadassah hospital building on Mount Scopus. She was there when the State of Israel was proclaimed, and her elder son, the late Paul Shulman, helped establish the Israeli Navy.         As national board chairman, she stayed in Israel to mesh Hadassah's medical and child-care centers of Palestine with the public health and sanitation programs being charted by the new state. She also remained there to serve as liaison between Hadassah members in Israel and the United States.         On a visit in Israel in 1967, she was about to leave when war broke out. She stayed on in Jerusalem to marshal Hadassah's resources and, the Six-Day War over, joined the first group to visit Mount Scopus after its capture by Israeli troops.         Rebecca Beldner was born in Vienna and brought to New York as a little girl. She graduated from Hunter College and its nursing school and started a career as a nurse and social worker. In 1918, she aided New York victims in the influenza epidemic.         In 1921, she married Herman Shulman, who became a prominent corporate lawyer and, like her, a strong supporter of Zionist causes.         Her husband died in 1945. She is survived by a son, Mark, of San Miguel Allende, Mexico, and seven grandchildren.       
         Bessie Schonberg, one of America's most influential teachers of dance composition and a mentor to several generations of dancers, died yesterday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 90.         Few dance educators were as respected as Miss Schonberg and because of the devoted attention she gave to students, few were as beloved. In recognition of her importance to dance, Dance Theater Workshop in 1984 named its annual New York Dance and Performance Awards the Bessies; it also dedicated its theater in Chelsea to her.         Miss Schonberg had an abiding interest in all forms of dance and taught choreographic fundamentals with equal sensitivity to modern dancers and ballet dancers and to traditionalists and experimentalists. She often told students and interviewers that the only thing dance should never be is dull.         She first attracted national attention for her dance composition classes at Sarah Lawrence College, where she began teaching in 1938. Her students there included such diverse dancers and choreographers as Lucinda Childs, Meredith Monk, Elizabeth Keen and Carolyn Adams. Although she retired from Sarah Lawrence in 1975, she never retired from teaching, and at the time of her death she was offering courses at the Juilliard School and New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.         In recent years she had also taught at Dance Theater of Harlem and Dance Theater Workshop. This summer she had planned to be choreographic adviser for Dancing in the Streets at Wave Hill and to teach at the Yard on Martha's Vineyard and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts. She was named this year's recipient of the American Dance Festival's Balasaraswati/Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke Award for Distinguished Teaching.         Miss Schonberg was born in Hanover, Germany. Her mother, an American opera singer, worked in Europe before World War I and married in Germany. After the war, Miss Schonberg's parents separated and her mother returned with her children to the United States and taught music at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Miss Schonberg attended that university and met Martha Hill, a dance teacher there who later founded such major institutions as the Bennington School of the Dance and the American Dance Festival.         With Miss Hill's encouragement, Miss Schonberg moved to New York in 1929, studied with Martha Graham and was briefly a member of the Graham company until an injury ended her performing career in 1931. She then studied at Bennington College, joining its faculty in 1934. Over the years she also taught at the American Dance Festival and many colleges and dance centers in the United States and Britain.         Miss Schonberg was on advisory panels for the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1988 she received a Bessie Award of her own for lifetime service to dance.         She is survived by a sister, Helga Hadsall, of Eugene.       
         Catherine McLeod, an actress whose headache-induced outburst -- ''Mother, please! I'd rather do it myself!'' -- became a national catch phrase in the early 1960's, died on Sunday at the Encino-Tarzana Medical Center in Encino, Calif. She was 75 and lived in nearby Sherman Oaks.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son Don Keefer Jr.         Before the 1963 Anacin commercial in which she erupted irritably in the kitchen, Ms. McLeod had been best known for her starring role in ''I've Always Loved You'' (1946), a romantic drama directed by Frank Borzage. Ms. McLeod was also featured in ''Courage of Lassie'' (1946), ''That's My Man'' (1947), ''The Fabulous Texan'' (1947), ''Old Los Angeles'' (1948), ''My Wife's Best Friend'' (1952) and ''Ride the Wild Surf'' (1964).         On television, she appeared in numerous live programs in the 1950's, as well as in episodes of ''Gun smoke,'' working with her husband, the actor Don Keefer.         Besides her husband and her son Don, of Studio City, she is survived by two other sons, John, of Santa Monica, and Tom, of Burbank, and a sister, Mary Jane O'Brien of West Covina.       
         Joanie Weston, a strapping power hitter who passed up a promising and respectable future in softball to become the gum-chewing, power-skating, hip-bumping golden girl of Roller Derby, died on May 10 at her home in Hayward, Calif., near San Francisco. She was 62 and skated in an exhibition game only last year.         Her husband, Nick Scopas, said the cause was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder.         Miss Weston may not have been the most accomplished athlete of her generation, but there surely were not many others who hit eight home runs in a single college softball game.         Miss Weston did just that at Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles, and in fact was perfectly prepared to keep on going. But, she liked to recall, the nuns, in a gesture of sublime sportsmanship and Christian compassion for the team's hapless junior college opponents, told her that if she hit a ninth one out of the park, they would excommunicate her on the spot.         Miss Weston, who was born in the Los Angeles-area town of Huntington Beach and grew up in nearby Downey, was a natural athlete who excelled in every sport she tried.         But she came of age at a time when professional athletic opportunities for women were few.         Still, if there were no major leagues for women, there was Roller Derby, and from the time she attended a tryout in Los Angeles when she was still a teen-ager, she was hooked by the sport.         After all, while Roller Derby's women did not skate with or against men, they were an integral part of the team, taking to the track for two of the four 12-minute quarters and skating under the same no-holds-barred rules that applied to their male teammates.         For all the sneering it engendered, Roller Derby had a surprisingly legitimate lineage.         Although the name and the vague underlying concept were dreamed up in Chicago in 1935 by Leo Seltzer, an impresario who needed an attraction to fill a hall he had leased, the classic game of Roller Derby was not invented until two years later, and the man who invented it was the writer Damon Runyon.         It was Runyon, having run into Mr. Seltzer in Miami in 1937, who devised the rules that transformed what had been a languid roller-skating variation of a marathon endurance walk into a quick, exciting and brutal sport: two pairs of rival ''jammers'' break out of a pack of 10 skaters and sprint around a 100-foot banked track, trying to lap and pass as many opponents as possible while their three teammates try to make things easier by slowing or even upending three rival blockers.         It was a prescription that made Roller Derby a national television rage in the 1950's and filled Madison Square Garden and other arenas as late as the mid-1970's.         During her 19 seasons, Miss Weston, known variously as the Blond Bomber, the Blond Amazon and the Roller Derby Queen, was a premier attraction.         As she was painfully aware, Roller Derby was a spectacle forever struggling to be a sport.         But in an event whose whooping fans reserved their loudest whoops for the skaters with the prettiest faces, the blondest hair and the most buxom figures, at least Miss Weston was as pretty as they come, her hair was longer and bleached blonder than anybody else's, and, at 5 feet 10 inches and 165 pounds, she had the perfect Roller Derby build.         It was a build that seemed designed to bounce an opponent on her bottom, and Miss Weston could easily hold her own in the hair-pulling, face-slapping, roll-around brawls that became one of Roller Derby's most crowd-pleasing attractions.         For all that, Miss Weston, who skated pivot, a position that allowed her to be a sprinting jammer in one 60-second jam and a blocker the next, approached Roller Derby as a consummate professional.         She spent untold hours practicing and perfecting the meticulous combinations of strides and body moves for each phase of the game.         Sport or spectacle, Roller Derby was undeniably rough, and Miss Weston had the false teeth to prove it.         In one memorable game, she once recalled, she got into such a vigorous quarrel with a referee that two of the teeth flew out of her mouth, barely missing the ref's ear.         ''I don't mind you yelling,'' the startled official said, ''but don't send your teeth out to bite me.''         Even after the league folded in the mid-1970's and Mr. Seltzer's son, Jerry, sold the name Roller Derby to other promoters, Miss Weston continued her devotion to her sport, training skaters and staging exhibition games at a Hayward track.         And oh, yes, the woman who once hit eight home runs in a single game became a fixture in Bay Area softball leagues.         In addition to her husband, Miss Weston, whose mother died several months ago, is survived by two stepchildren, Tracy Munoz of Hayward and Nick Scopas Jr. of Manteca, Calif., and four stepgrandchildren.       
         Patricia Mason, a real-estate broker who handled the sales of some of New York's best-known properties in recent years and who was well-known as a horticulturist, died at St. Vincent's Hospital early yesterday. She was 71 and lived in Greenwich Village.         Her husband, Francis S. Mason Jr., said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Mason joined the William B. May Company in 1968 and at the time of her death was a senior vice-president who specialized in sales of town houses in Greenwich Village.         One closely watched sale she arranged was the house at 19 Gramercy Park, which sold for $1.5 million in 1979. Benjamin Sonnenberg, a public relations executive, had bought two adjoining houses in 1933 and converted them to a 37-room six-story mansion. The ballroom was said to be the scene of some of the most fashionable parties of the 1940's.         Mrs. Mason also handled the sale of 128 East 19th Street; the property had belonged to the ballet promoter Lincoln Kirstein who died early last year. She donated her commission from that sale to the Lincoln Kirstein Fund at the School of American Ballet.         In addition, it was at her suggestion that the Stuyvesant-Fish House on Stuyvesant Street was recently donated to Cooper Union. F. Phillip Geraci, who bought the landmark building in 1967 and spent 12 years restoring it, was a friend and client. The house was built in 1802 as a wedding present for Elizabeth Stuyvesant and Col. Nicholas Fish; she was the great-granddaughter of Peter Stuyvesant.         The Masons were married in New York in 1952; in 1956 they went to Yugoslavia where they spent four years. Mrs. Mason represented the Lutheran World Relief and Church World Service. Mr. Mason was a cultural affairs officer with the United States Information Agency.         Mrs. Mason's interest in horticulture began during those years. Her gardens in Belgrade, London, Washington and New York were frequently shown on horticultural tours. The garden of her home on Morton Street in Greenwich Village and of her family home -- established 50 years ago by her mother, Leslie Ten Eyck Michaels, at Manursing Island in Rye, N.Y. -- were among the first to be shown to the public under the auspices of the Garden Conservancy, a national organization that works to preserve exceptional gardens.         Mrs. Mason was born in Miami Beach, graduated from Wellesley College in 1948 and received a master's degree from the London School of Economics the following year. In London she worked for the United Nations World magazine and later was on the staff of the International Labor Organization in Geneva. She returned to Manhattan in 1951.         She worked with horticultural groups including the Garden Conservancy, the rock garden committee of the New York Botanical Garden, the North American Rock Garden Society, the International Dendrological Society and Wave Hill, in the Bronx.         In addition to her husband she is survived by a son, Spencer Mason of Pforzheim, Germany; a daughter, Leslie Scarlett Mason of Manhattan, and one grandchild.       
         Una E. Johnson, who built the print collection of the Brooklyn Museum of Art into one of the country's largest and best, died April 28 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Johnson, who was born in Dayton, Iowa, in 1905, was educated at the University of Chicago where she studied art history and literature, and at what is now called Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.         She worked at the Cleveland Museum of Art before going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1936 as assistant curator of prints and drawings under Carl O. Schniewind. In 1941 he retired and she was appointed curator, a position she held until her own retirement in 1969. She was named curator emeritus by the museum in 1973. In 1947 she organized the museum's first annual National Print Exhibition, and she supervised them until 1968.         Ms. Johnson wrote numerous books and catalogues including ''Georges Rouault and His Prints,'' ''20th-Century Master Drawings,'' ''American Prints and Printmakers,'' ''Isabel Bishop, Prints and Drawings: 1925-1964,'' ''Adja Yunkers: 1927-1967,'' ''The American Woodcut: 1670-1950'' and, most important, a monograph about the  French art dealer Ambroise Vollard that catalogued his activities as a publisher of prints and illustrated books. The monograph, originally published by Wittenborn & Schultz in 1944, was republished by the Museum of Modern Art in 1977.         Ms. Johnson also served for three years as director of the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y.       
         Queen Mother Moore, a civil rights worker and black nationalist, died on Friday in a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 98 and a longtime resident of Harlem.         Miss Moore, whose real name was Audley Moore, was a hero to many residents of Harlem, where she worked with Marcus Garvey, the Jamaican-born black nationalist leader, and his Back-to-Africa movement. She was also an advocate of reparations for slavery, tenants' rights and education for the poor.         Howard Dodson, the head of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, in Harlem, said in 1995 that her career constituted ''a link between the best elements of the nationalist and radical left political traditions in Harlem over the past five, six decades.''         Miss Moore came to be called Queen Mother during a trip to Africa years ago, when a tribe in Ghana awarded her the honorary title. In Africa, as she once put it, ''I felt the lash on the backs of my people.''         Her outrage over the suffering of blacks in America led to years of political action. ''They not only called us Negroes, they made us Negroes,'' she once said, ''things that don't know where they came from and don't even care that they don't know. Negro is a state of mind, and they massacred our minds.''         Audley Eloise Moore was born in New Iberia, La., a town west of New Orleans. Her family's past reflected the racism she fought: one of her grandfathers was lynched, and one of her grandmothers, a slave, was raped by a white man.         Miss Moore's parents died when she was young, and she dropped out of school, becoming a hairdresser. Largely self-educated, she was inspired by the writings of Frederick Douglass and by Garvey's oratory, which she first heard in New Orleans. She was also fond of Nelson Mandela's dictum, ''The struggle is my life.''         Stirred by Garvey's pride in blacks' African heritage, Miss Moore and her two sisters went to Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. There, she married Frank Warner.         In Harlem, Miss Moore became prominent in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the organization Garvey founded in 1914.         Beginning in the 1960's, Miss Moore was among black leaders demanding reparations from the United States Government for the sufferings of blacks under slavery. In 1994, she addressed a conference in Detroit of the the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, where she declared, in a voice gone soft and husky with age: ''Reparations. Reparations. Keep on. Keep on. We've got to win.''         In 1966, Miss Moore was among parents and civil rights workers who staged a sit-in in the Board of Education's meeting hall in Brooklyn, where the protesters accused board members of neglecting the needs of schools in poor neighborhoods.         Miss Moore said of the district superintendents: ''Run them out. They're perpetuating idiot factories among us.''         In 1989, Miss Moore and more than 40 other prominent black women were honored at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, in Washington, where ''I Dream a World,'' an exhibition of photographs of them by Brian Lanker, was on display.         ''These women are bound by their grit and unquenchable spirit,'' Marion Wright Edelman, a civil rights lawyer and the executive director of the Children's Defense fund, said at the show. ''They lifted the veil of impossibility despite the barriers of race and sex.''         Miss Moore's husband died in 1967. She is survived by a son, Thomas O. Warner of Philadelphia, five grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Rosalind Gurwin, a benefactor of Jewish causes in the United States and Israel, died on Saturday at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. She was 73 and lived in Kings Point, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was a heart ailment, said her husband, Joseph Gurwin, a retired textile manufacturer.         The couple established the Rosalind and Joseph Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Center in Commack, N.Y., a highly rated 300-bed nursing home, in 1988. A nonprofit institution, it was the first kosher nursing home to open in Suffolk County.         The Gurwins have been prominent supporters of the UJA-Federation of New York, American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Israel Bonds and the National United Jewish Appeal, among others. She was a trustee of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.         With her husband, she supported Yeshiva University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicne, Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel. Other beneficiaries included the American Society for Technion, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and the Tel Aviv Foundation.         Born Rosalind Brizell in Manhattan, she was a graduate of City College.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Gurwin is survived by their daughter, Laura Flug of Manhattan; a son, Eric, of Livingston, N.J.; her twin brother, Murray Brizell of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
         Florence M. Kelley, the first administrative judge of the modern Family Court in New York City and an advocate for the legal rights of the poor, died last Saturday at her home in Little Compton, R.I. She was 85.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, David S. Worgan, a retired executive assistant district attorney of New York County.         Judge Kelley presided over the notoriously overworked court during an era of great reform. In 1960, she became the first woman to be chief judge of what was then the Domestic Relations Court of New York City.         ''Florence and I went to Yale Law School together,'' said Mayor Robert F. Wagner when he appointed her. ''She's moved further than I -- and done much better.''         In 1962, when the court was reconfigured as the new Family Court of the State of New York, within the City of New York, with jurisdiction over a range of social problems, she became administrative judge.         A slim, gracious woman, Judge Kelley was ladylike in her manner but decisive and stubborn in her role as a visionary administrator. Then as now, the Family Court, regarded as the stepchild of the system, was criticized for its sprawling caseload. Judge Kelley pressed for more judges, psychiatric evaluations for clients and probation services for juveniles.         Her dedication to legal and social services for the poor was a family heritage: her grandmother, for whom she was named, was one of the first women lawyers in the country and the founder of the National Consumers League, an advocates' group for which Judge Kelley worked.         Born in Manhattan, Judge Kelley graduated from Smith College and Yale Law School.         In the 1930's and 40's, women prosecutors were a a rare sight in the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, where Judge Kelley worked under Thomas E. Dewey and Frank S. Hogan. She next turned to the private sector, spending a few years in a Wall Street law firm. But in 1947, she returned to public life as the attorney in charge of the criminal branch of the Legal Aid Society, where she spent 13 years.         She managed to maintain her sense of humor. Illustrating the heavy caseload of lawyers for the indigent, she told how she introduced herself to a new client in the city's detention pen by saying hesitantly, ''You're the man who robbed the delicatessen.''         He demurred. ''No ma'am,'' he said helpfully, ''I'm the one who pushed the woman out of the 13th-story window.''         In 1970, Judge Kelley became a trial judge of the Supreme Court of New York, serving until her retirement in 1980.         But retirement was a relative term for a woman who was also president of the Women's City Club and a member of foundations dedicated to the poor and the mentally ill. She and her husband moved to Little Compton, where she served on the town planning board and helped raise money for the Sakonnet Light House, which was relighted in March.         In addition to her husband of 44 years, her survivors include her brothers, Augustus M. Kelley and Nicholas Kelley Jr.       
         Mary D. Keyserling, an economist who made women and children the focus of her work in and out of government, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in McLean, Va. She was 87 and had been director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau during the era of feminist ferment in the 1960's.         Her brother, Dr. Thomas D. Dublin of Washington, said the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease.         By 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to head the Women's Bureau, Dr. Keyserling had established herself as a leading economist and as a champion of economic opportunities for women.         She was also something of a Washington insider: the wife of Leon H. Keyserling, a prominent economist who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Harry S. Truman, and a woman of accomplishment with a wide circle of influential friends.         She had worked closely with Eleanor Roosevelt as chief of the research and statistics division of the Office of Civilian Defense in World War II, and with W.  Averell Harriman as chief of the Commerce Department's international economics division from 1946 to 1953.         Dr. Keyserling was a onetime president of the Women's National Democratic Club.         She also ran the District of Columbia Commission on the Status of Women and advised the National Academy of Sciences on child development, working on issues that had been a major concern since she was a child.         Dr. Keyserling's mother had been a college-trained social worker, and her father was a statistician and vice president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.         As a girl growing up in Manhattan and on a farm in Westchester County, Dr. Keyserling weighed the rival parental influences, then blithely chose to follow both at once by becoming an economist specializing in social issues, like the sometimes high prices paid by consumers and the often low wages earned by women.         After graduating from Barnard College, where she was president of her senior class, she did graduate work at the Geneva School of International Studies and the London School of Economics before to New York. It was at Columbia University that she caught the eye of Mr. Keyserling, a young economics instructor. They were married in 1940, when she was 30.         As a Government economist in an era when the New Deal had attracted droves of women to high-level Federal positions, Dr. Keyserling had a lot of company in the corridors of power. But it was a tribute to her prominence that when the prestigious Cosmos Club in Washington finally deigned to admit women in 1988, she was one of the first 18 women to join.         As director of the Women's Bureau until 1969, Dr. Keyserling was in the forefront of efforts to obtain and enforce Federal legislation banning sex discrimination in employment.         It was a task that had its surreal moments, like the time she participated in a White House conference whose major concern seemed to be whether Playboy clubs would be forced to hire men as ''bunnies.''         For all her official accomplishments, Dr. Keyserling may have made her most powerful impact on social policy after she left the Government. She supervised a vast study of commercial day-care operations for the National Council of Jewish Women, producing a highly critical 1972 report, ''Window on Day Care,'' that became the national blueprint for changes in such programs.         Besides her brother, she is survived by another brother, Amos Dublin of Norwich, Vt. Her husband died in 1987.       
         Dr. Katherine Esau, an international leader in studying plant structure who laid the foundation for much current research into plant function, died on June 4 at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 99.         ''She absolutely dominated the field of plant anatomy and morphology for several decades,'' said Dr. Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden. ''She set the stage for all kinds of modern advances in plant physiology and molecular biology. You have to understand the structure of plants first before you can unravel the questions of molecular biology.''         In 1989, President George Bush awarded Dr. Esau, professor emerita at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the National Medal of Science. Dr. Ray F. Evert, the Katherine Esau Professor of Botany and Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, who accepted the medal on her behalf, said she was the first full-fledged botanist to win that award. Dr. Esau (pronounced EE-saw) was also the sixth woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences, in 1957, the academy said.         Dr. Esau's long career, which began in czarist Russia and ended with the publication of her last research paper in 1990, reflected the methodological changes of this century. She started with techniques of agricultural research, plant selection and hybridization, then moved into light-microscope studies of plant anatomy and the damage caused by viruses.         Dr. Esau had planned to retire after she became professor emerita in 1965, but a fascination with electron microscopy led her to spend her final decades working in that area.         She studied plant development and the effects of viruses on plant tissues, and she did much work on phloem tissue, which transports food from a plant's leaves to its roots. And much of what she did pointed the way for  molecular studies by others.         Dr. Esau noticed that virus particles appeared to move from cell to cell along structures called plasmodesmata, which were smaller in diameter than the viruses they transported, and she suggested that if molecular biologists looked at this transport, they would learn a lot about cell function. That is in fact being done, Dr. Evert said.         ''She was the grande dame of American botany and probably worldwide botany as well,'' Dr. Evert said.         For many decades, Dr. Esau's ''Plant Anatomy,'' published by John Wiley & Sons in 1953 and updated in 1965, was the leading text on plant structure in the nation and was widely adopted abroad. Now a classic, it is being updated by Dr. Evert, who was a graduate student of Dr. Esau. He is also preparing a new edition of Dr. Esau's ''The Anatomy of Seed Plants,'' published by John Wiley & Sons in 1960 and updated by Dr. Esau in 1977.         Katherine Esau was born on April 3, 1898, in Yekaterinoslav, now Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. She studied agriculture for a year in Moscow, but her studies were interrupted by the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.         In 1918 she and her family, Mennonites of German descent, rode on a wagon for two weeks with other refugees to reach Germany, where she continued her agricultural training and worked on farms. In 1922 she graduated from the Berlin Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule, and she and her parents emigrated to the United States and settled in a largely Mennonite community in Reedley, Calif., near Fresno.         She soon joined the Spreckels Company near Salinas, Calif., where she worked on a sugar beet that would be resistant to the curly top virus. When she was invited to the University of California at Davis in 1927, she arrived with a truckload of beets and beet seed. While her work soon branched out, she revisited curly top virus in beets and other plants many times.         The Davis campus did not register graduate students at the time, so she registered at the Berkeley campus. While her thesis defense took place at Berkeley, which granted her a doctorate in 1931, her research was done on the Davis campus, and she joined the faculty there.         In 1963 Dr. Esau moved to the Santa Barbara campus with the intention of retiring in two years. But her interest in electron microscopy led her to keep working and publishing. She worked on revisions to ''Plant Anatomy'' until 1992.         There are no survivors.       
         Rita Dimitri, a multilingual singer who was the ebullient spirit of the Manhattan supper club La Chansonette for more than 20 years, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 67.         Stanley Brilliant, her husband,  partner and frequent accompanist, said the cause was kidney cancer.         Besides performing at the candle-lighted Chansonette, Miss Dimitri appeared on Broadway and on national tour in the mid-1950's in the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' playing the singer who owns a boite in Montmarte.         In time, life imitated art, because Mr. Brilliant, who combined his family's interest in real estate with his own passion for music, built La Chansonette for her.         ''It was like a wedding gift,'' he said yesterday.         By January 1962, when they opened the intimate supper club at 890 Second Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, Miss Dimitri had long achieved popularity in Europe and had made her mark in the theater in United States and as an attraction at clubs like Le Ruban Bleu in Manhattan, Old New Orleans in Washington, the Black Orchid in Chicago, the Moulin Rouge in Boston and the Ritz Carlton in Montreal. For several years in the 1970's, Miss Dimitri also appeared annually at Alice Tully Hall.         With her upswept red hair, dangling earrings, chunky necklaces and gowns cut to accentuate her figure, the half-French, half-Greek (''makes me Freek'') Miss Dimitri epitomized the Continental chanteuse.         In a 1954 interview, Miss Dimitri recalled how the owner of the Old New Orleans approached her in Paris and asked if she could sing in English. Miss Dimitri raised an eyebrow.         ''I sing,'' she said, ''in English, French, Greek, Italian, Spanish and Turkish.''         In a typical appearance, she would perch beside red roses atop La Chansonette's white piano and cast a roguish eye over an audience that might include Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Leona Helmsley (the club's landlord) or Laurence Rockefeller, who was partial to ''If I Were a Rich Man'' from ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' Miss Dimitri would banter with her husband at the piano and apply her smoky mezzo, her arsenal of languages and her ineradicable Mediterranean accent to songs associated with Edith Piaf, Charles Aznavour, Charles Trenet or Gilbert Becaud. There might be titles like ''L'Accordioniste'' and ''Never on Sunday'' and ''My Man.''         Miss Dimitri, born in Nice, France, to a Greek father and French mother, moved to Greece at an early age and grew up bilingual.         Once she recalled that she was 14 when an older sister took her to a theater-nightclub in Athens, where she was urged to sing in a talent show. ''Too young to be nervous,'' she said. She won the contest and said that soon thereafter she was cast in her first musical, began playing leading roles in Athens theaters and eventually became known as the Judy Garland of Greece.         Miss Dimitri toured with her own troupe in Turkey and Egypt and appeared in London and Paris, which led to the offer to perform in the United States.         Mr. Brilliant, her only survivor, said that in 1984, deciding that it was time for a change and responding to a good offer, they sold La Chansonette, which became a restaurant under another name. The couple took to the road, appearing in other clubs in New York, around the country and in Europe until a few years ago.         ''It was a great era,'' said Mr. Brilliant. ''I'm glad we were part of it.''       
         Joan Daves, a leading literary agent whose client list included six Nobel Prize winners, died on Wednesday at her home in Bedford, N.Y. Ms. Davis, who also had a home in Manhattan, was 77.         Her husband, Joe H. Kirchberger, said the cause was an acute asthmatic attack.         For decades, Ms. Daves was regarded as one of the world's foremost agents for serious and intellectual fiction and nonfiction. Her Nobel Prize-winning clients included Heinrich Boll (1972), Elias Canetti (1981), Herman Hesse (1946), the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1964), Nelly Sachs (1966) and Gabriela Mistral (1945). All but Dr. King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize and took Ms. Daves with him to Stockholm when he received the award, were laureates in literature.         Ms. Daves (pronounced DAY-vis) also represented such renowned authors as Frank O'Connor, Isaac Babel, Vaclav Havel and Rachel Carson, the trailblazing environmentalist who wrote ''Silent Spring'' and ''The Sea Around Us.''         ''She loved these authors, which conjures up another world; it wasn't the fast buck,'' said Jennifer Lyons, who became her associate when Ms. Daves affiliated her one-woman agency in 1987 with a larger Manhattan agency, Writers House, to secure the interests of her authors as she grew older. ''There was a real passion for authors themselves, for artists and for literature that is rare today.''         Robert Weil, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, recalled that Ms. Daves became familiar with Dr. King in the early 1950's before he achieved national prominence while leading the 1955 boycott of the segregated transit system in Montgomery, Ala.         Mr. Weil said Ms. Daves told a friend that there was an extremely articulate, charismatic and visionary minister from the South she had to meet. ''She could spot very early people's genius and people's talent,'' Mr. Weil said. ''She also sided with the underdog.''         In addition, Mr. Weil said: ''She was literature. She was a brilliant critic, a brilliant reader. She was extremely nurturing. She had a social flair as well. She was a great person to put together people as if she ran a salon in New York which combined the writers of post-World War II European literature with the needs of American publishers.''         In the sale of American rights, the Joan Daves Agency also represented a number of distinguished foreign publishers, like Kinderbuch Verlag of Switzerland, the German concerns Carl Hanser Verlag of Munich and Verlag Kipenheuer und Witsch of Cologne, and the Austrian concern Residenz Verlag of Salzburg.         Ms. Daves, who was later to Americanize her name, was born in Berlin in 1919 and grew up as Liselotte Davidson. She was the middle child and younger daughter of a Jewish banker who was to die in Auschwitz.         In the mid-1930's after the Nazis came to power, her father sent her to Paris, where she became fluent in French. She was forced to return to Berlin when the Nazis imposed currency restrictions on Jews, but she reached Britain in 1938 and followed her sister to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City.         An avid reader who was always interested in books, she worked for a couple of years for Interscience Publishers, publishers of scientific books and books by refugees. In 1942, she went to work as an editor for Harper & Brothers, where she started the Harper's Art Library, which issued books about Durer and Flemish and French master drawings.         In the early 1950's she established the Joan Daves Agency and used her European connections to attract the Continent's foremost writers.         Besides her husband, Ms. Daves is survived by a brother, Peter Davidson of Las Vegas.         In 1992, in ceremonies at the consulate in Manhattan, Ms. Daves was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in recognition of a lifetime of advancement of German culture and literature.       
         Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious, a Chicago lawyer who held high posts in the Nixon and Bush Administrations, was active in the civil rights movement and was on the boards of major corporations, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 75.         The cause of death was breast cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a Republican, was known as Jewel S. Lafontant when she served in the Nixon and Bush Administrations. Prior to that, President Richard M. Nixon had appointed her to the Justice Department as Deputy Solicitor General -- the first woman and the first black person to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office.  She held that post from 1973 to 1975. Under President George Bush, from 1989 to 1993, she was in the State Department with the concurrent titles of ambassador-at-large and coordinator of refugee affairs.         In the civil rights field, she was a founding member of the Congress of Racial Equality, an officer of the Chicago chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. During the early 1940's, The Chicago Sun-Times reported yesterday, ''She brought change to the city by participating in sit-ins at Loop restaurants.'' In a 1991 interview, she recalled, ''Often we were spat upon and physically abused.''         Times changed, and from 1965 to 1967 she was on the President's Council on Minority Business Enterprise. In the early 1970's Ebony magazine named her one of the 100 most influential black Americans.         The corporate boards she was on over the years included those of the Mobil Corporation, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Trans World Airlines, Revlon, Inc., Harte-Hanks Communications, the Hanes Corporation and the Bendix Corporation         During her career, she was also a director of nonprofit institutions including Oberlin College, Howard University and Tuskegee Institute. And she received numerous awards and honorary degrees.         At her death she was a partner in the Chicago law firm of Holleb & Coff, which she joined in 1993. Her law practice, in her years there, was concentrated in the areas of corporate law, labor and employment law, and governmental and international relations.         Jewel Stradford was born in Chicago, the daughter of C. Francis Stradford -- a lawyer -- and Aida Arabella Cartera, and grew up there. She graduated in 1943 from Oberlin College and received a law degree in 1946 from the University of Chicago.         But afterward, The Sun-Times reported, she could not obtain office space, no major white law firm would employ her, and the Chigago Bar Association would not admit her as a member. In 1947, she went to work in the legal aid bureau of a charitable organization, before going on to work for a succession of Chicago law firms and doing much trial work.         During the Eisenhower Administration, from 1955 to 1958, she served as assistant United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1960, she seconded the nomination of Mr. Nixon as Republican candidate for President, but he was defeated by John F. Kennedy.         As the Bush Administration's coordinator for refugee affairs, she dealt with a staggering variety of problems. In 1989, when Moscow was permitting record numbers of Soviet Jews and Pentecostals to leave its soil, she declared that the Bush Adminstration wanted to ''get control over the flow'' of emigres. In 1990, she went to London and reaffirmed a Bush Administration pledge that the United States would help to settle half of all new Vietnamese boat people -- refugees who fled their country by sea and mostly went to camps in the British crown colony of Hong Kong.         In the same year, she went to the African nation of Malawi, which had been flooded with refugees from a civil war in neighboring Mozambique.         Her 1946 marriage to John Rogers ended in divorce in 1961. Later that year she married H. Ernest Lafontant, and he died in 1976.         She is survived by her husband of seven years, Naguib S. Mankarious; a son, John W. Rogers Jr. of Chicago, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  June 13, 1997, Friday         The obituary of Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious on June 3 referred incorrectly to a distinction she attained when she became Deputy Solicitor General of the United States in 1973. While she was the first woman to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office, she was not the highest-ranking black staff member. That was Thurgood Marshall, who became Solicitor General in 1965.       
         Helen Hull Jacobs, who played the sturdy foil to Helen Wills Moody's willowy star turn in the rivalry that captivated women's tennis in the 1930's, died Monday night in Easthampton, N.Y., where she had lived for the past four years. She was 88.         Ralph Smith, her longtime lawyer, said the probable cause of death was heart failure.         Helen Jacobs was a champion in her own right, winning nine major championships, including the United States national title four straight times from 1932-35 and the Wimbledon singles in 1936. She was a mainstay for the United States Wightman Cup team from 1927-39.         But her achievements were always measured against the incomparable brilliance and celebrity of Helen Wills Moody. More gracious than graceful, more indomitable than invincible, always trying but seldom triumphant, Jacobs played Helen the Second to Moody's Helen the First.         That the competitive history between the two northern Californians was called a rivalry, dubbed the Battle of the Helens by a sometimes frothy news media between the two world wars, was a tribute more to  Jacobs's tenacity and cheerful pluck than to her shot-making power or on-court success against Moody. Jacobs scored only 1 victory in 11 matches against Moody, and that victory was tainted by controversy when Moody decided to retire with a back injury while trailing by 8-6, 3-6, 3-0 in the 1933 United States final at Forest Hills, N.Y.         The match mesmerized 8,000 fans at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Queens on Aug. 26, 1933, pitting the forehand chop, aggressive net play and dogged determination of Jacobs against backcourt precision and waning power of Moody. When the seesaw affair came to its anticlimactic conclusion when Moody walked to the net, addressed the umpire, collected her blue sweater and retired from the fray, Jacobs rushed over and pleaded with her to continue. It was an upset of titanic proportions: Moody had not lost on any court since 1926; she had not even lost a set between 1926 and the 1933 Wimbledon semifinals.         While some accounts the next day took Moody to task for depriving Jacobs of the satisfaction of outright victory, Moody was given the last word in a statement handed out following the match: ''The match was long and by defaulting I do not wish to detract from the excellence of Miss Jacobs's play. I feel I have spoiled the finish of the national championship. I still feel I did right in withdrawing because I felt that I was on the verge of a collapse on the court.''         Jacobs was commended by Allison Danzig in The New York Times for receiving Moody's decision ''with sympathy and the finest sportsmanship.'' They were traits that earned Jacobs a dedicated following throughout her career. Even years later when she was asked to recall the incident, Jacobs maintained the high road. In a 1967 article in The Times, while she allowed that Moody ''did not look at me'' when she retired, Jacobs summed up the moment in typically generous fashion: ''So she defaulted. That was it. We never spoke a mean word to each other. We never nursed grudges.''         The two produced another enthralling final in a major championship: the Wimbledon title match in 1935. Again Moody stole the thunder; once again the circumstances were riveting. Jacobs held a match point at 5-3 before 19,000 fans at Center Court. She seemed, at last, to be ready to claim her moment, and thwart Moody, who was returning to competition after a two-year absence. Instead, Jacobs plowed a short Moody lob into the net when a gust of wind misdirected the ball. Moody won the next four games and the match, 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, for her seventh Wimbledon title.         Jacobs's contribution to tennis history is as the gracious runner-up, and it is probably fitting that her lasting footnote at Wimbledon is as the first woman to popularize man-tailored shorts as on-court attire. ''It seemed the sensible thing to do,'' she would say later.         In the end, Jacobs's admirable courage and fighting qualities earned her nine Grand Slam titles, and a triple crown of singles, doubles and mixed doubles at the 1934 United States Nationals. She was ranked in the world Top 10 for 12 straight times from 1928, was No. 1 in 1936, and was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1962.         Jacobs was a commander in United States Navy intelligence in World War II, one of five women in the Navy to achieve the rank of commander. She retired from tennis in 1947 and enjoyed a career as a writer of 19 books, a farmer and a designer of sportswear.         Jacobs is survived by her companion, Virginia Gurnee; a sister, Jean Jacobs Gross of Oakland, Calif.; a niece, Wendy Moore, and three great nieces.       
         Edythe Meserand, who was one of the first women to become a radio news executive, died on Monday at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.. She was 88.         Ms. Meserand began her career in 1926 in the press department of the National Broadcasting Company, which had been newly formed from WJZ and WEAF. It was a period when women were in policy-making positions at NBC, and Ms. Meserand was a protegee of Margaret Cuthbert, director of talks, and Bertha Brainard, director of programming.         In 1931 she went to work for the Hearst radio stations. She was the director of promotions for the 10 Hearst stations, and the ''Musical Clock Girl'' on WGBS, the station that was the forerunner of WINS in New York City. Her job was to announce the time of day, play music and deliver the news.         She left Hearst in 1937 and became assistant news director of WOR, making her one of the first women in radio to assign reporters and shape the news broadcast. At that time, news was part of the station's publicity department. When World War II came, WOR lacked a news department and appropriate facilities for radio transmissions. Ms. Meserand helped design what was considered the first modern radio newsroom. While at WOR, she also produced some of radio's first news documentaries using realistic background sound.         During World War II, when her boss, David Driscoll, became a war correspondent, Ms. Meserand took over the department.         She was born in 1908 in Philadelphia and grew in up in the Bronx and on Long Island.         She received a number of honors and awards for her work, and in 1951 became a founder of American Women in Radio and Television, serving as its first president.         As WOR began to move into television, Ms. Meserand produced programs in that medium for the station. She retired from WOR in 1952 and moved to a tree farm in Charleston, N.Y. There, she started an advertising agency and managed radio and television campaigns for Mary Anne Krupsak, former Lieutenant Governor of New York.         In 1976, Ms. Meserand was honored by the Northeast Area Conference of American Women in Radio and Television for her 50 years in the industry. During her years in Charleston, she also founded the Charleston Historical Society to save the town's First Baptist Church, built during the presidency of George Washington.         She is survived by her companion, Jane Barton, and a sister, Mary Miserendino of Convent Station, N.J.       
         Annie Fratellini, who wiggled, waddled and waltzed through big tops in Europe before she opened a college for aspiring circus performers who wanted to follow in her outsized, floppy footsteps, died on Tuesday in Paris. She was 64.         The cause was cancer. The National Circus School, which she started in the 1970's and which is credited with training dozens of clowns and other circus workers, said that she had been hospitalized in a clinic outside Paris since June 10.         ''She harkened back to the golden age of clowning in France,'' said Paul Binder, a founder of the Big Apple Circus, who worked with Miss Fratellini in the 1970's after she saw him juggling on television. ''If there had been no Annie Fratellini, there would be no Big Apple Circus. She brought us to her circus and showed us the beauty of the intimate theatrical circus, and that was the inspiration for our circus.''         Miss Fratellini, born in a trunk, the fourth generation of one of Europe's most famous circus families, was neither as droopy as Emmett Kelly nor as boisterous as Bozo. But for years she avoided following her father, grandfather and 22 other relatives into the ring. Instead, she sang in music halls and nightclubs until 1960, when she met and married Pierre Etaix, the person she credited with making her take her talent for clowning seriously.         ''I was born a clown,'' she said in 1977. ''I never felt comfortable as a woman. It took Pierre to recognize that.''         In the ring, Mr. Etaix was the serious one who specialized in elegant sleight-of-hand. Miss Fratellini was dizzy and outlandish-looking, an overgrown child with a painted-on smile and half-moon eyebrows. When Mr. Etaix lifted off his top hat with a flourish, she was standing by with water to dump in it. When she had the spotlight to herself, she would play two concertinas at once, or try to. She would let the two instruments cascade toward the ground like a waterfall as she made the crowd laugh with her body-bending stage business.         Or she would poke fun at French expressions like ''Il est encore jeune'' (it is still too young), which is normally used to describe wine that is not mature enough to drink. Mr. Etaix would go onstage playing a baritone saxophone. She would step into the spotlight with a miniature sax and interrupt him.         ''Why is that saxophone so small?'' he would ask.         ''Il est encore jeune,'' she would reply.         But Miss Fratellini did not get many laughs at her debut. ''Circus people didn't believe that a woman could take pratfalls, get slapped and kicked and be ridiculous,'' she recalled in 1977, arguing passionately that women could be acclaimed clowns.         ''A clown is sexless, so you must hide your breasts and face,'' she said. ''But women have more sensitivity, the essential quality. It's not a question of gaiety or humor. A clown isn't a comedian. To be a good clown you must have lived.''         The National Circus School eventually offered courses in such circus essentials as magic, trapeze, gymnastics and tightrope walking. But at first all she had was a subsidy from the French Government, a trapeze and a tightrope. Six months later she bought a tent. One thing this taught her students was how to concentrate, for the would-be clowns had to practice their juggling while wobbly unicyclists zipped between them.         ''To be a clown means more than just putting on a costume and making funny faces at the audience,'' Miss Fratellini said in 1993. ''The clown must take the audience on a unique adventure in a strange dimension.''         But Miss Fratellini cautioned her students that a circus performer's life was not as glamorous as it probably appeared to the audience. ''It's terribly grueling -- too much travel and tough physically,'' she said.         But it was not a lesson that her students absorbed. Her daughter, Valerie, is an accomplished trapeeze artist. Her brother Victor worked and taught at the school.         Miss Fratellini, who is survived by Mr. Etaix as well as her daughter, also appeared in several movies, including ''Zazie Dans le Metro,'' a 1961 film by Louis Malle.       
         Madelon DeVoe Talley, an investment manager who was one of Wall Street's first female executives, died Friday in a car accident near Wyndam, N.Y., her husband, Truman M. Talley, said. She was 65.         Despite a longtime interest in finance, Mrs. Talley did not begin her career until 1969, when she was in her late 30's and in the midst of raising three children.         In his book ''The Go-Go Years,'' an account of Wall Street during the 1960's, the author John Brooks said Mrs. Talley was a ''New York housewife who had tired of full-time housewifery,'' when she took a job as an assistant analyst at the Dreyfus Corporation.         A year later, she was named co-manager of the Dreyfus Leverage Fund, a promotion that made her the first female fund manager on Wall Street.         During her tenure at Dreyfus, which lasted until 1977, Mrs. Talley managed several funds, was a member of the firm's executive committee and earned a reputation as one of the sharper financial minds around.         During that period she also received a B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College.         ''She had a lot of energy, talent and ability in the field, and did very well,'' said Howard Stein, the retired chairman of Dreyfus.         Mrs. Talley left Dreyfus to develop programs for the American Women's Economic Development Corporation, a joint venture of the Small Business Administration and the Commerce Department that aids women entrepreneurs.         Mrs. Talley said she took the job to hone her interest in small business rather than further an interest in business.         ''Everybody in my family has started his own business,'' she said in a 1979 interview.         ''My father-in-law started a paperback book company; my father started two businesses on Wall Street, and my grandfather started two businesses in Hoboken.''         The call of the investment world was strong, however, and seven months after taking on her new position Mrs. Talley returned to it.         In February 1979 she was appointed New York State's director of the division of investments and cash management, a job that included the management of the state's $16 billion common retirement fund.         ''Madelon Talley set the procedures and processes for the retirement funds, so that when the markets started to rise in 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 800, we were set,'' said Edward V. Regan, the former New York State Controller who hired her. ''It was a very, very major contribution.''         Mrs. Talley kept her Albany job until June 1982, when she left to join Rothschild Inc. as president of its asset management unit. She held the post for two years, leaving to set up a hedge investment fund for private investors.         In the last decade, Mrs. Talley devoted much of her time to writing about investing and serving on various boards.         From 1993 to 1995, she served as a governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers. In 1995, she was appointed a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She wrote two books and numerous articles for a variety of publications.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Talley was vice chairman of W. P. Carey & Company, a real estate concern, a member of Alliance Capital Management's International Advisory Committee and a member of the board of the Joffrey Ballet.         ''She knew our business as a customer and a vendor, and she did a great job for New York State by getting the state heavily into stocks in the early 1980's, which was the right thing to do,'' said Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital.         A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Talley was a 10th-generation New Yorker, her forebears having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine in the mid-17th century.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Talley is survived by a son, MacDonald W. Talley of Pacific Grove, Calif.; two daughters, Melanie Talley Whately and Marina Talley, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. of Sea Girt, N.J.       
         Mattie Lou O'Kelley, who began painting as a hobby at the age of 60 and became a celebrated folk artist of rural Southern life, died on Saturday at her home in Decatur, Ga. She was 89.         In her art, she pictured nostalgic views of the Georgia countryside she knew in her childhood in the early part of the 20th century: barns, farmers, animals and gardens filled with flowers and vegetables. The titles of Miss O'Kelley's paintings reflect her spirit as well as their subject matter: ''Papa Feeding the Stock at 4 A.M.,'' ''Bringing in the Night Water'' and a self-portrait, ''Mattie in the Morning Glories.'' Her work is in various museum collections, including the American Museum of Folk Art and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.         Robert Bishop, an art dealer and collector and later the director of the American Museum of Folk Art (in Manhattan), is credited with discovering Miss O'Kelley, a story he recounted in 1989 in the introduction to the book ''Mattie Lou O'Kelley: Folk Artist. By Mattie Herself.'' In 1975, he was in Atlanta to lecture about quilts at the High Museum, and Gudmund Vigtel, the director of the museum, told him about a ''painting lady'' from Maysville, Ga., who had traveled to Atlanta by bus to show him her pictures. Mr. Vigtel had purchased one for the museum. It was, said Mr. Bishop, ''a rich, bountiful still life with a basket of lettuce and vegetables and fruit on a vibrant aqua-and-white-checkered tablecloth.'' Several other O'Kelley pictures were on sale in the museum's gift shop.         Mr. Bishop was astonished. Here was, he said, ''a true American primitive -- self-taught, an exquisite recorder of time and place.'' And ''most compelling of all,'' he added, an artist with ''a unique vision.'' He immediately canceled his flight back to Detroit, where he was director of publications at the Henry Ford Museum, and drove 50 miles to find the artist, tracking her down in her one-room cabin in sleepy Maysville. They became friends and he brought her work to the attention of museums and other collectors.         She was born in Maysville, in northeast Georgia, as the seventh of eight children, and grew up on a corn and cotton farm. For financial reasons, she was forced to end her schooling in the ninth grade and spent the remainder of her childhood on the family farm. When her father died in 1943, she moved to the town, where she worked as a seamstress, cook and waitress. After she retired in 1968 at 60, she began to paint. ''I had always wanted to paint,'' she said. ''Now I had the time.''         In 1976, she was honored with a Governor's Award in the Arts for the state of Georgia. As her fame spread, she was written about in newspapers and national magazines and television cameras arrived on her doorstep. When Mr. Bishop became head of the Museum of American Folk Art, he suggested that Miss O'Kelley move to New York. Briefly she lived in Manhattan and painted urban landscapes. Mr. Bishop said that the crowds and the cold winter made New York ''a place from which to escape.'' Eventually, she decided to return to the South, moving first to Florida and then in 1983 back to Georgia, making her home in Decatur, where she lived the rest of her life. Mr. Bishop died in 1991. Miss O'Kelley has no survivors.         In the 1980's she published several books, ''A Winter Place,'' ''From the Hills of Georgia: An Autobiography in Paintings'' and ''Circus.'' Her art also appeared on calendars, and in 1980 she had a picture of a cat on the cover of Life magazine.         One of her principal collectors was T. Marshall Hahn, a retired executive with Georgia-Pacific. Mr. Hahn remembered Miss O'Kelley visiting him on his farm and painting in his yard. Wearing a sunbonnet, she sat at a card table, and sketched, flat on the table, gradually turning a pencil drawing into a painting.         She also wrote poetry, which was as homely as her canvases:         Now my one room house has only me,         I never roam,         No lessons have I. But I paint         And paint         And stay at home.       
         Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.         Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood.         The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as ''the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.''         The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.         Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler ''the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life.'' Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that ''her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come,'' particularly its cultural life.         Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.         She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.         During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.         When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.         ''She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done,'' said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. ''She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities.''         Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be ''tough, but not intractable,'' someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually ''usually got her way.''         Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.         ''She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles,'' said David Halberstam, whose book, ''The Powers That Be,'' chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. ''If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player.''         At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.         ''Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language,'' he said. ''It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them.''         Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.         In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.         She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.         Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.         One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.         ''I think of myself as a catalyst,'' she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. ''There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job.''       
         Mary Louise Smith, a representative of the Republican Party's moderate wing and the only woman ever to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee, died on Friday at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. She was 82 and a longtime resident of Des Moines.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son James E. Smith.         Mrs. Smith was chosen to be chairman of the Republican National Committee by Gerald Ford when he succeeded Richard M. Nixon as President in 1974.         She headed the party during the difficult period after Watergate and announced in November 1976 -- three weeks after President Ford was defeated for re-election by Jimmy Carter -- that she would step down in January 1977, instead of serving two more years.         When she made her decision known, she urged Republicans to avoid ''destructive division'' and ''a fatal lurch to either extreme of the political spectrum.''         Mrs. Smith evidently decided to step down when she did because she thought that the question of whether a moderate or a conservative was to succeed her should be resolved as soon as possible so that the party could begin getting ready for the 1978 Congressional and 1980 Presidential elections.         At the time, her party's conservative faction, associated with Ronald Reagan held the moderates responsible for President Ford's defeat. In January 1977, the Republican National Committee elected Bill Brock, a conservative former Senator from Tennessee, to succeed Mrs. Smith. After Mr. Reagan was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Smith to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. But in his second term, after she had been critical of Administration policies on civil rights, he refused to reappoint her.         Mrs. Smith, whose maiden name was Epperson, was born in the small Iowa town of Eddyville and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa. She became active and prominent in Republican politics and served on the Republican National Committee from 1964 to 1984. She also became a feminist and became known for supporting civil rights and abortion rights.         Her husband, Dr. Elmer Milton Smith, whom she married in 1934, died in 1980.         In addition to her son James, of Des Moines, she is survived by another son, Dr. Robert C., of East Lansing, Mich.; a daughter, Maggie of Jamestown, Calif.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Sherman Peet, a former advertising executive, died Aug. 6 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., after a fall, her son, Charles D. Peet Jr., said. She was 90 and a longtime resident of Bronxville.         Born in Detroit, Mrs. Peet, who was known professionally as Margot Sherman, was the first female graduate of the journalism department at the University of Michigan, where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the national honors society.         Following her marriage to Charles D. Peet, a New York lawyer, in 1936, Miss Sherman started her career in advertising as a copywriter for McCann-Erickson, Inc.         She worked for the Madison Avenue agency for the next 37 years and held a variety of different positions. In recognition of her multifaceted role at McCann-Erickson, in 1958 the American Advertising Federation named her Advertising Woman of the Year. In 1964 she was named senior vice president and assistant to the president at McCann-Erickson, and became the first woman to serve on the agency's board.         Before going into advertising, Ms. Sherman had worked in journalism.  At The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, she was a columnist and editor. Subsequently she worked at The Detroit News and The Detroit Times.         Survivors include her son, of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret Peet Anderson of Hoboken, N.J., and five grandchildren. Ms. Sherman's husband died in 1967.       
         Jean Westwood, who was a leader of George McGovern's disastrous Democratic campaign for President in 1972 and was the first woman to be chairman of a major political party, died on Monday in American Fork Hospital in American Fork, Utah, where she had lived for the last two years. She was 73.         The cause was complications from a pituitary tumor, said her husband, Richard E. Westwood.         Mrs. Westwood was an enthusiastic supporter of Democratic candidates and Democratic causes. But her period of leadership came during a time of Republican victories. So the unenvious task of trying to put a brave face on the McGovern campaign fell to Mrs. Westwood, who became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee after Mr. McGovern won the Democratic nomination.         ''It is pompous nonsense for anyone to presume to predict the result of an election seven weeks hence,'' she said in September 1972 as Mr. McGovern badly trailed President Richard M. Nixon. ''And it is ridiculous for any observer to conclude now that the whole thing is decided and the campaign is all over.''         But the whole thing was decided and the campaign was all over. Mr. McGovern carried only the Democratic bastions of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. He was not the only loser. Mrs. Westwood faced  her share of the blame for the rout and, three weeks after the election, found herself combating suggestions that she resign.         ''I will not quit,'' she declared. But by December, she was gone after just five months as party chairman, whose title she preferred over chairwoman (''It's not something I'm going to fret about,'' Mrs. Westwood said when she got the job.)         Mr. McGovern, reached today at his vacation home in Montana, remembered Mrs. Westwood as ''a person who combined a tough mind with a warm heart.'' As an example, he offered a description of how he reached the decision to drop Senator Thomas F. Eagleton as his Vice-Presidential running mate.         Mr. Eagleton had revealed that he was hospitalized for ''fatigue and nervous exhaustion'' three times and underwent electric shock treatments for depression, almost derailing an already stumbling Presidential campaign.         Mr. McGovern said: ''I was calling key people in the campaign to decide what to do, and I can remember almost her exact words. She said, 'It's painful for me to do anything that might hurt Senator Eagleton, but if his staying on the ticket endangers our election chances, that hurts all the millions of people we want to serve, so I think he should step down.' That showed her compassion and tough-mindedness.''         Mr. McGovern later settled on Sargent Shriver as a running mate.         In 1968, Mrs. Westwood worked for the Presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York and, after his assassination, turned to Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, another loser to Mr. Nixon.         In 1975, she helped lead the Presidential campaign of Terry Sanford, then the president of Duke University, and in 1985 she played a similar role for Bruce Babbitt. She lived in Arizona from 1976 to 1995 and served as an adviser to Mr. Babbitt when he was the Governor.         The success that eluded Mrs. Westwood in politics came to her in business. In their home state, Utah, she and her husband simultaneously ran businesses that raised minks, built apartments and installed swimming pools.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Westwood is survived by a son, Richard E. Westwood Jr., of Highland, Utah; a daughter, Beth Davies of American Fork; two brothers, John K. Miles of Provo, Utah, and David H. Miles of Orem, Utah; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Lucy Somerville Howorth, a lawyer who said her advocacy of women's rights was inspired by the campaign that won women the vote under the 19th Amendment, died on Aug. 23 at her home in Cleveland, Miss. She was 102.         Mrs. Howorth watched from a crowded Statehouse gallery in Nashville on Aug. 18, 1920, when Tennessee ratified nationwide women's suffrage, and as the 36th state to do so put the 19th Amendment into the Constitution.         A native Mississippian, Mrs. Howorth spent much of her life in the political arena, including a turn as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1932. She was known as Judge Lucy, a sobriquet that stuck after she was appointed a United States Commissioner -- or magistrate -- for the Southern Judicial District of Mississippi in 1927.         A few years later, she moved to Washington and held legal positions in Federal agencies where few women had gone before. She retired in 1954 as general counsel of the War Claims Commission and returned home to the practice of law.         She was a national officer in the American Association of University Women, played a pivotal role in ending the organization's practice of racial segregation in the 1940's and headed a task force on the status of women and their employment opportunities after World War II. As an association vice president in the 1950's, she traveled widely and gave speeches around the country.         Born in Greenville, Miss., she came from a long line of lawyers rooted in colonial America. As a child, she said, her mother took her to suffragist meetings and nurtured her daughter's independent spirit and her wish to become a lawyer, an aspiration hardly befitting a fine Southern lady then.         Her mother, Nellie Nugent Somerville, was the first woman to be elected to the Mississippi Legislature, and Lucy also served there for four years in the 1930's.         Lucy Somerville graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1916 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and went on to study at Columbia University, where she attended political rallies and meetings and regularly visited settlement houses.         ''It was in New York City at that time,'' she recalled when Radcliffe College honored her in 1983 for a lifetime of achievements, ''that I learned to be a whole human being.''         Back home, she earned her law degree with highest honors at the University of Mississippi in 1922 and practiced law until her appointment as Judge Lucy five years later. She held positions on the legal staff in the Veterans Administration and was a director of the V.A. Employees Credit Union from 1937 to 1949, when she joined the War Claims Commission as associate general counsel.         After leaving the Government, she joined her husband, Joseph Marion Howorth, in practicing law again in Cleveland, Miss., until about 1980. Mr. Howorth died in 1982 after 54 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Howorth was president of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Washington and often served as a mentor to women in government. President John F. Kennedy named Mrs. Howorth to a task force on Federal employment for his Commission on the Status of Women.       
         Mary Weinberger, a lifelong advocate for the rights of people with muscular dystrophy, died on Sept. 8 at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J. She was 89 and had lived in Long Beach, N.Y.         Mrs. Weinberger had been hospitalized since June, when a coronary infection was diagnosed, a niece, Susan Dick of West Long Branch, N.J., said. Mrs. Weinberger died of bone marrow failure, Ms. Dick said.         Mrs. Weinberger became involved in the rights of the disabled after doctors told her that her adopted son, Richard, 2, had muscular dystrophy.         Richard had to use a wheelchair by the age of 5 and died, at 17, in 1959.         She rallied for the rights of people with physical and mental disabilities to live in their own homes instead of  institutions.         Along with her husband, Arnold, she was a founding member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the national organization best known for fund-raising telethons with its chairman, Jerry Lewis, as host.         She set up a foundation named after her son and was among the founders of Independent Living for the Handicapped, a Brooklyn-based advocacy group that helps the severely disabled to live in their own homes.         Mrs. Weinberger, a native of Manhattan, lived in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, for most of her life until 1975, when she moved to Long Beach.         Her husband died in 1983. She is survived by her sister, Frances Fenig of Miami Beach, Fla.       
         Dr. Barbara D. Munk, an expert in the psychiatry of adolescence who worked with mentally ill mothers and their vulnerable infant children, died on Sept. 12 at New York Hospital after a seven-year battle with cancer. She was 72 and lived in Manhattan.         Confronting one of society's darkest secrets, infanticide, Dr. Munk created a program for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation with a twofold objective: to help mentally ill mothers who were threatened with losing custody of their children, while protecting the infants and toddlers from neglect and abuse.         ''The child is the one who needs to be protected,'' Dr. Munk would often remind her staff of clinical social workers in the Parent-Infant Therapeutic Program at Gouverneur Hospital, an affiliate of the New York University School of Medicine and member of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.         Dr. Munk, who was director of child and adolescent psychiatry services at the hospital, would personally examine the children entrusted to her care, as well as their mothers, for signs of abuse, including marks on their bodies.         ''Traditional fragmented care for the individual parent and infant will not do,'' she wrote in a 1993 article for the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs. ''We need programs designed to provide a safety net for the parent with mental illness, the offspring at risk and the family under stress.''         Her program accepted referrals of pregnant women and parents with emotional and mental disturbances like postpartum depression, schizophrenia, severe anxiety and personality disorders and dual diagnosis with drug abuse. They would be welcomed together with their children, from birth through age 5, who were at risk of slow development, disturbances or disabilities.         Initially financed as a pilot project in 1986 by the New York State Office of Mental Health, Dr. Munk's program drew referrals from private and public agencies in all five boroughs of New York City.         She provided help for more than 1,000 poor and ethnically diverse mothers and their children. Nearly half the children were less than a year old.         One child, Owen Green, came to Dr. Munk's attention through the city's Child Welfare Administration when he was 7 months old. His parents were paranoid schizophrenics who fought constantly, she wrote in one of her case studies.         Placement in foster care was a real possibility for Owen, she said.  But her team of clinical social workers arranged for Owen and his mother to stay with Owen's grandmother, preserving Owen's caretaking environment and family connection, she said. While Mr. Green was separated from the family, Owen, his mother and grandmother received continuing treatment.         As a result, she said, Owen had a normal physical development, indicated a high intellectual potential and an endearing capacity to relate to others.         Dr. Munk, who was born in Berlin in 1925, studied at the Hamburg University School of Medicine and at the University of Neurology and Psychiatry in Hamburg. She completed her residency in Child Psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital in 1959.         She was a psychiatric consultant to the Brooklyn Juvenile Court, the Max Planck Institute in Munich and the New York Foundling Hospital and was a clinical associate professor and supervisor in child psychiatry at New York University Hospital.         She served on the board of the Puerto Rican Family Institute for more than 30 years and on the New York Council on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for eight years.         Dr. Munk is survived by two brothers, Dr. Peter Munk and Dr. Klaus Munk, and a sister, Dr. Rosemarie Hoffman, all of Berlin.       
         Gertrude S. Lookstein, who with her husband, Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein, was a leader in the New York Orthodox community and active in a number of organizations, died on Sept. 9 at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 90.         Her maternal grandfather, Rabbi Moses Z. Margolies, was the leader of Congregation Kehilath Jeshrun in Manhattan. He was succeeded by her husband, who served also as president, then chancellor, of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel, until his death in 1979. Their son, Haskel, succeeded his father in the rabbinate in Kehilath Jeshrun.         Mrs. Lookstein was a national board member and New York chapter president of Amit Women. She was also involved in fund-raising for the Yeshiva University Women's Organization, the U.J.A. Federation and the Women's Branch of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Nathalie Friedman; three sisters, Nathalie Herman and Hilda Fischman of Manhattan and Sylvia Lipton of Los Angeles; a brother, Charles Schlang of Scottsdale, Ariz.; eight grandchildren, and 28 great-grandchildren.       
         Myra Tanner Weiss, an unlikely Trotskyist whose radical vision of an egalitarian, collectivist society led her to organize migrant farm workers, rail against racism, make two quixotic mayoral races in Los Angeles and run for Vice President of the United States three times on the Socialist Workers Party ticket, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Indio, Calif. She was 80.         At first glance, Mrs. Weiss would hardly seem the type to be attracted to Leon Trotsky's version of Marxism, and not simply because she cut a stylish figure in leftist circles -- a small, attractive woman who was always immaculately turned out, generally in a well-cut suit of lush material run up by her husband's tailoring family.         Mrs. Weiss, who was on the Socialist Workers Party's national ticket in 1952, 1956 and 1960, was the daughter of an unabashed capitalist, Myron Tanner, who managed an investment syndicate before becoming a top insurance salesman in Los Angeles. And her roots were in Salt Lake City, a decidedly conservative city whose politics, customs and thinking tended to reflect the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.         But by the time she joined the Socialist Workers Party while attending the University of Utah in 1935, her family had already distanced itself from the Mormon Church. Her grandfather, Joseph Marion Tanner, an educator who was president of Utah State University, became so distraught when the church discontinued its doctrine of polygamy in 1890, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling that polygamy was not a permissible exercise of religious freedom, that he abandoned his six wives and fled to Canada.         Almost from the beginning, Mrs. Weiss was in the forefront of the socialist movement. Dropping out of college to follow her family to California, she took courses at the University of California at Los Angeles, but she soon left college, first to organize agriculture and cannery workers and later to help establish the Socialist Workers Party in Los Angeles, where she and another party organizer, Murry Weiss, began a romance that led to marriage.         After running for mayor of Los Angeles in 1945 and again in 1949, Mrs. Weiss and her husband came to New York, where he served as editor and she as a staff writer for the party's newspaper, The Militant.         A fiery speaker, Mrs. Weiss was chosen in 1952 as the running mate of the party's Presidential candidate, Farrell Dobbs, a onetime truck driver who had virtually created the teamsters' union as a national force before becoming a Socialist Workers official. But in three Presidential campaigns, party records show, the Dobbs-Weiss ticket polled a total of only 10,381 votes in 7 states in 1952, 7,799 votes in 4 states in 1956 and 40,328 votes in 12 states in 1960.         Partly because they believed that the party's democratic ideals were being overriden by oppressive bureaucratic controls, the Weisses withdrew in the 1960's, but Mrs. Weiss never abandoned her radical vision -- and paid a price for it.         In 1972, after receiving a degree in political science from New York University, she found she could not get a teaching job, and worked as a proofreader as a member of the International Typographical Union. In her later years, she championed feminism along with socialism.         Mrs. Weiss, whose husband died in 1981, is survived by two sisters, Shirley Nagel of La Quinta, Calif., and Martha Stinehart of Los Angeles, and two brothers, Norman Tanner of Salt Lake City and Dee Tanner of Pasadena, Calif.       
         Harriet Browne, a tap dancer, choreographer and teacher who performed with the Copasetics, died on Sept. 1 at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. She was 65 and lived in the Bronx.         Her manager, Susan Goldbetter, said Ms. Browne had been ill for a long time but did not specify the cause.         Ms. Browne specialized in a form of tap dancing in shallow sand that both softened and enhanced the rhythmic sounds made by the feet. A performer who was both warm and glitteringly sophisticated on the stage, she appeared in the 1950's with musical artists who included Cab Calloway, Dinah Washington and Della Reese. She also danced with such master tap dancers as Bunny  Briggs, Charles Cook and Buster Brown, many of whom had been her teachers. Her career continued into the 1990's, when she danced with the Silverbelles, a group of female tap dancers who had performed at many of the great nightclubs in New York City. She appeared with Sister Sledge and the Pointer Sisters, as well as tap groups that included Jane Goldberg's Changing Times Tap company.         Ms. Browne was also the artistic director of the Aristaccato Tap Company, a group of inner-city Bronx youths to whom she had taught tap and jazz technique, performing skills and history at the school she founded in the borough.         Born in Chicago, Ms. Browne came east early in the 1950's. After study with Mary Bruce in Harlem, she was soon performing as a solo, duet and chorus dancer at clubs in New York. During that time, her tap choreography helped her find work in variety and nightclub shows and tours in Europe.         Ms. Browne was honored last year for her choreography in a National Tap Dance Day program at Alice Tully Hall. She was honored this year by St. Peter's Church, where the funeral service will take place tomorrow, as one of three ''Great Dancing Ladies of Harlem.''         She is survived by her husband, Edward; a son, Renell Gonsalves of Detroit; a daughter, April Browne of Queens, and a sister, Marquita Gove of Los Angeles.         Correction:  September 15, 1997, Monday         A picture caption on Sept. 6 with the obituary of the tap dancer and choreographer Harriet Browne misidentified the dance group for which she was costumed, and misspelled the name of the group cited erroneously. She was shown in the Silver Belles. The other group was the Copa Setics, not Copasetics.       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Ann Devroy, the White House correspondent for The Washington Post who was known for her assertiveness and digging, died today. She was 49 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, the Post said.         A veteran political journalist who covered four Presidents, Ms. Devroy had a reputation for tough reporting that prompted discomfort among politicians and late-night phone calls to competitors from editors hoping to match her articles.         ''She made more than one President squirm,'' President Clinton said today.         Ms. Devroy came to Washington in 1977 as a reporter for the Gannett News Service, covering first Congress in the Carter years and then the Reagan White House. In 1985 she joined the Post as as political editor and directed the newspaper's coverage of Congress, the White House and national politics for the next four years. She later covered the Bush and Clinton Administrations.         Ms. Devroy was born in Green Bay, Wis., and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1971.         She is survived by her husband, Mark Matthews, the diplomatic correspondent for The Baltimore Sun; a daughter, Sarah; her mother, Elaine A. Bellin, of Rockville, Md.; a brother, Neil Devroy of Heath, Tex., and two step-brothers, Michael Ryan, of Madison, Wis. and James Ryan, of Savage, Minn.       
         Evelyn Slewett, a founder of the National Parkinson Foundation and supporter of numerous charitable organizations, died Oct. 14 at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. She was 87 and lived in Miami.         The cause was cancer, the foundation said.         Mrs. Slewett, a native of New York, graduated from Hunter College in 1932 and founded a private kindergarten, Millerkins, in New York City.         She also continued a tradition of charitable work begun by her father, Andrew Miller, founder of Boys Town of Jerusalem.         After her father's death in the 1940's, Mrs. Slewett became a major figure in the institution. Her other beneficiaries included Girls Town in Jerusalem, Miami University and various other institutions..         She helped establish the National Parkinson Foundation in 1957 with her husband, Nathan Slewett, a lawyer who became its chairman in 1981. The couple traveled worldwide to raise money for the organization.         Besides her husband of 57 years, Mrs. Slewett is survived by two sons, Robert D. and Alan M., both of Miami; a brother, Leon Miller, of Great Neck, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Mina S. Rees, a mathematician who broke new ground for women as a university administrator and a leader in the sciences, died on Saturday at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Upper East Side.         At home in abstract and applied mathematics, Dr. Rees was founding president of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York. She was the first woman elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest alliance of scientists in the world.         Dr. Rees was born in Cleveland. She went to school in New York, attended Hunter College High School and graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College in 1923. She completed graduate studies at Columbia University, where she also studied law. She received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1931.         In the meantime, in 1926, she returned to Hunter as a mathematics instructor. Dr. Rees was an associate professor during World War II, when she went to work for the Government, helping to direct research in  modern mathematics for the war effort.         Dr. Rees was trained in pure algebra, but she was gifted with common sense and a knack for the practical, which stood her in good stead in dealing with the military.         ''I could sass the admirals as the men couldn't,'' she recalled later.         She was sent to the applied mathematics panel of the National Defense Research Committee in the Office of Research and Development.         By 1946, she was head of the mathematics branch of the Office of Naval Research, a position that she held until 1949, after which she was deputy director of the entire science division until 1953.         She worked on projects like fluid flow to solve antisubmarine problems, hydrofoil designs and early rocketry. She was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit and the British Medal for Service in the Defense of Freedom.         Dr. Rees also had an important role in the growth and diversification of mathematical studies. Many of her ideas left their mark on fast computer technology.         Dr. Rees returned to Hunter in 1953, as a professor and dean of students. She was responsible for academic affairs, including curriculum development, admissions standards, faculty recruitment and budgeting for teaching and research.         She became the first dean of graduate studies at CUNY in 1961, when the university drew up its doctoral programs. She was named president of the graduate division in 1969 and president of the newly consolidated Graduate School and University Center on 42d Street in 1971, before retiring the next year.         Dr. Rees was a Presidential appointee to the board of the National Science Foundation from 1964 to 1970, and she was active in the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, among other groups.         Dr. Rees enjoyed a crowning moment in 1969, when the 120,000-member American Association for the Advancement of Science elected her president. Women remained something of a rarity at that level in the scientific community, but she -- as  Marie Curie, Lisa Meitner and Dr. Margaret Mead before her -- had proved that scientific creativity was not just for men.         Dr. Rees's husband, Dr. Leopold Brahdy, died in 1977.       
         Esther G. Gottesman, whose service to the Jewish community spanned more than 60 years and who played an important role in the acquisition of the Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98 and had homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan.         Mrs. Gottesman's interest and appreciation of the historical importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls led her to recommend to her brother-in-law, D. Samuel Gottesman, that he finance their acquisition and donate them to Israel. The Shrine of the Book was later established at the Israel Museum to display the scrolls.         A lifelong Zionist, she was a delegate to the first postwar congress of the World Zionist Organization in Basel, Switzerland, in 1946. She was a member of the WZO Action Committee during the formative years of the State of Israel. A supporter of Jewish education, she was active in the Board of Jewish Education in New York for many years.         A national board member of Hadassah since 1934, Mrs. Gottesman held many positions in the organization, including vice president and treasurer. As a committee chairman, she advocated the idea that the group support the expansion of a vocational educational program from a small high school to a major college, the Hadassah College of Technology in Jerusalem. She donated the college's auditorium and gymnasium and raised funds for it.         She was also responsible for developing what had been a house newsletter into Hadassah Magazine, and she assembled and arranged publication of the book, ''Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People.''         Mrs. Gottesman was born in Manhattan in 1898, the daughter of Aaron and Sarah Garfunkel. She graduated from New York University in 1921 and married Benjamin Gottesman, a banker and investment manager, the same year. He died in 1979.         The couple's financial support of Yeshiva University resulted in the establishment of the Mendel Gottesman Library, named after Mr. Gottesman's father, the endowment of a chair in Library Sciences and creation of the Benjamin Gottesman Presidential Lecture Series. The family's involvement with the university covered 75 years.         She is survived by two sons, David S. Gottesman of Manhattan and Milton M. Gottesman of Washington; two brothers, Harold Garfunkel of Manhattan and Julian Garfunkel of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a sister, Florence Roswell of Manhattan; three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Marian E. Koshland, an immunologist and professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the ways antibodies fight off disease, died on Tuesday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley. She was 76 and lived in Lafayette, Calif.         The cause was lung cancer, the university said.         Dr. Koshland, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the president of the American Association of Immunologists in 1982 and 1983, discovered that antibodies differ in their amino acid composition, a factor that makes them extremely efficient at fending off disease.         She made the discovery by studying a molecule of phosphate and a molecule of arsenate. The two substances are somewhat similar chemically, but she found that they produced distinct and noticeably different antibodies when exposed to an antigen.         She also discovered a molecular chain that allows antibodies to be exported from a cell and to circulate in the bloodstream.         In 1991 she and her colleagues at Berkeley described the characteristics of a pathway that apparently serves as an intracellular superhighway, bypassing normal intracellular communication channels and making possible the proliferation of B-cells, which are essential in fighting off infection.         Dr. Koshland, who was born in New Haven on Oct. 25, 1921, received a bachelor's degree from Vassar College in 1942, a master's degree from Vassar the next year and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1949. During World War II, she worked on a research team that produced a vaccine for cholera, and in 1945 and 1946 she was a research assistant on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.         After two years as a fellow in the department of bacteriology at Harvard University, she joined the staff of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, first as an associate bacteriologist in the biology department and, from 1963 to 1965, as a bacteriologist.         She moved to Berkeley in 1965 as an associate research immunologist in the virus laboratory. In 1966, she became a lecturer in the department of molecularly biology. She was named a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology in 1970, and headed the department from 1982 to 1989.         Dr. Koshland, who was also the head of the graduate affairs division in the department, was a member of the National Science Board from 1976 to 1982 and of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences. She had continued to do research in her laboratory until recently.         She is survived by her husband, Daniel E. Koshland Jr., a biochemist at Berkeley and a former editor of the journal Science; five children, Ellen Koshland McCaughey of Melbourne, Australia; Phyllis Koshland of Paris; James, of Palo Alto, Calif.; Gail Koshland Wachtel of Tucson, Ariz., and Douglas, of Baltimore, and nine grandchildren.       
         Annie Dodge Wauneka, who broke custom and became the Navajo Nation's first female legislator and a health crusader, died on Monday at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona. She was 87 and lived in Klagetoh, in northeast Arizona.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said Ted Rushton, a spokesman in Window Rock, Ariz., the Navajo capital.         For many years starting in the 1950's, Mrs. Wauneka traveled to villages and clinics, covering the 24,000-square-mile territory of the Navajo to preach public health standards. She cut a striking figure, tall and always wearing traditional Navajo clothing, including a colorful shawl and silver jewelry.         Over the years, she urged the Navajo to adopt more modern dwellings,  and she worked to improve the quality of water on the reservation. She also helped many people obtain medical attention after generations of reliance solely on tradition. She received much of the credit for defeating tuberculosis among the Navajo beginning in the 1950's and received national recognition for her role.         Albert A. Hale, president of the Navajo Nation, called her ''our legendary mother'' and ''the most honored Navajo in our history.'' He directed all public offices to shut down for one day last week, except for emergency services.         Annie Dodge was born in Deer Springs, Ariz., and learned of public service from her father, Henry Chee Dodge, a chief and first president of the Navajo Nation's legislative Tribal Council. Its jurisdiction stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. She became the first woman on the council in 1951, winning an election over two rival candidates. One of those was her husband, George L. Wauneka, with whom she ran a ranch owned by her father in Arizona.         Mrs. Wauneka was in the council for nearly 30 years, serving as the chairwoman of the health committee. Her concern with public health could be traced to her grade-school days, when the influenza pandemic at the end of World War I killed many Navajos. She escaped with a mild attack and, even as an 8-year-old, helped the overworked nurse at her school in Fort Defiance, Ariz.         Her formal education ended in the 11th grade, when she began tending to the needs of her tribe at the side of her father, who had become head of the Tribal Council and her political mentor. ''From my childhood,'' she said later, ''I have been aware of the problems of my tribe and have wanted to help make our people aware of them.''         Among her frustrations were the objections of tribal medicine makers to new ways. She conceded that the medicine makers performed much good work among the people, especially in family matters. But she said: ''The Navajo is caught in between. I must convince them to accept a mixture.''         In 1963, Mrs. Wauneka and 30 diplomats, educators, musicians, authors and a former Supreme Court justice received the newly created Presidential Medal of Freedom for service to their country. President John F. Kennedy established the honor on July 4, 1963; after his assassination, the medals were presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson.         Mrs. Wauneka's husband died in 1994. Her survivors include four daughters, Irma Bluehouse, Laurencita Cohoe, Georgia Ann Plummer and Sally S. Wauneka; five sons, Franklin, George L. Jr., Henry Chee, Norman and Timothy; a sister, Ann Shirley, and three brothers, Bernard, Sam and Walter Shirley.       
         Catharine Carver, who won trans-Atlantic esteem as the editor of a galaxy of mid-20th century authors, including Hannah Arendt, John Berryman, Saul Bellow and Flannery O'Connor, died on Tuesday at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. Ms. Carver, an American who lived in London, was 76.         Friends said she died after a series of strokes.         Ms. Carver was widely known for her work at Lippincott with Leon Edel on many of the volumes of his biography of Henry James, a work she abridged at the author's request into a single volume. He acknowledged her success with thanks in his preface.         The last book to receive her professional attention, which was characterized by devotion to her authors, profound intelligence, sensitivity and scholarship and mastery of subject, as well as attention to detail and, above all, passion, was Richard Ellmann's biography ''Oscar Wilde,'' published by Knopf in 1987.         Aileen Ward, whose biography of John Keats won a National Book Award, said she was impressed that Ms. Carver had reread all of Keats's work before beginning to edit the manuscript. It was Ms. Carver who pointed out to Mr. Ellmann, who was baffled by James Joyce's use of the word trombone in a nonmusical sense while he was collecting an edition of the author's letters, that Joyce had simply appropriated a French colloquialism for paper clip.         Besides the praise she earned from individual authors, whose ranks also included E.E. Cummings, Lionel Trilling, Katherine Anne Porter, Bernard Malamud, Leslie Fiedler and Peter Matthiessen, Ms. Carver was given a citation some 20 years ago by New York P.E.N., the writers organization, for her ''creative contributions to authors and their works.''         Ms. Carver, who was born in Cambridge, Ohio, graduated in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Muskingum College in Ohio, where she was a classmate of the future astronaut and senator, John Glenn.         She began her editing career in 1945 with Reynal & Hitchcock, became the first reader at Partisan Review and was hired in 1950 by Robert Giroux as an editor at Harcourt, Brace and Company.         Subsequently she worked for Viking, Lippincott in Philadelphia and, briefly, for The New Yorker before leaving the United States in the 1960's to settle in England. There she worked at John Murray's and Chatto & Windus before joining Oxford University Press. But when that publisher shut down its offices in London, Ms. Carver declined to move to Oxford. Remaining in London, she worked with various publishers, including Victor Gollancz, and in the 1980's joined Trianon Press in Paris before returning to London.         She is not survived by any immediate family members.       
         Joyce Wethered, an elegant Englishwoman described by ''The Encyclopedia of Golf'' as ''the supreme woman golfer of her age, perhaps of all time,'' died last Tuesday, the day after her 96th birthday.         The Times of London agreed with that assessment. It said Wethered was ''the most stylish and successful woman golfer of her day, and is still widely regarded as the best the world has seen.''         In an era when women's golf was strictly an amateur game, Wethered, later known formally as Lady Heathcoat Amory, had a short career. Yet she won the British Amateur championship four times (1922, 1924, 1925 and 1929) and the English Amateur five consecutive years (1920 through 1924).         In 1930, Bobby Jones, the celebrated American golfer, played an exhibition with her at St. Andrews in Scotland. Afterward, he said he doubted if there had ever been a better golfer, man or woman.         In The Associated Press's 50-year poll in 1950, Wethered ranked seventh among all golfers and first among female golfers. The men ahead of her were Jones, Ben Hogan, Walter Hagen, Byron Nelson, Sam Snead and Gene Sarazen.         As a child, she was considered too frail for school and was tutored instead. On vacations, she was introduced to golf. She played with her brother, Roger, a future British Amateur champion. At age 10, she shot an 89.         In 1920, she was the No. 6 player on the Surrey county team, but had had only one lesson from a professional. She entered the English women's championship only because a teammate insisted on it. She beat Cecil  Leitch in the final, Leitch's first loss in a nonhandicap match in seven years.         At 5 feet 10 inches, Wethered was willowy, with a long and easy picture-book swing. She was a long hitter, outdriving the male amateurs who represented Britain in the Walker Cup matches by 20 yards.         When Willie Wilson, a Scottish professional who settled at the Pinehurst Country Club in North Carolina, was asked about her driving, he said: ''Why, mon, she could hit a ball 240 yards on the fly while standing barefoot on a cake of ice.''         At 23, after winning the 1925 British Amateur, she retired for the first time. She explained her decision this way: ''I have simply exercised a woman's prerogative of doing something without the slightest regard for what anybody thinks and because I want to please myself.''         In 1929, she was persuaded to play again. In a classic British Amateur final, she was five shots down after 11 holes to the American champion Glenna Collett, but won the scheduled 36-hole match, 3 and 1.         She retired again. In 1933, she was hired by Fortnum and Mason, the London department store, to advise customers about golf clubs and golf clothes. Uneasy British officials felt sure that made her a professional.         In 1935, she removed all doubt. She wanted to visit friends in North America. To help defray expenses, she agreed to accept money to play more than 50 exhibitions with such golfers as Jones, Sarazen and Babe Didriksen. She netted $20,000.         In one exhibition, her partner was Charlie Yates, an American who won the British Amateur three years later. ''I shot a 76 that day and I didn't help Joyce a single shot,'' he said. ''Not one. God, she could play.''         In 1937, Wethered married a baronet, Sir John Heathcoat Amory. Golf took a back seat in her life.         At home in Devon, she and her husband built a fine collection of paintings. Their garden won the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honor. They had no children. When her husband died in 1972, their house was turned over to the National Trust.         Perhaps the best-known story about her golf dealt with her concentration. Once, as she was about to hit a 9-foot putt on the 17th hole at the Sheringham course in Norfolk, a train rumbled by within 100 yards. She sank the putt anyway. When her playing partner said he was surprised the train had not interfered with her shot, she appeared baffled.         ''What train?'' she said.       
         Rella MacDougall, a prominent decorator who was the longtime chairwoman of the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House, died on Wednesday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was cancer, said Harry Hinson, the fabric designer, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. MacDougall led the show house, which used annual interior design shows to raise money for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, as it changed from a fledgling organization 24 years ago into an institution in interior design and the largest show house in the country. In 1972, the first show house raised $53,000 for the club, which runs after-school recreation programs in the South Bronx. In recent years, the show house has raised more than $500,000 annually.         Mrs. MacDougall was widely admired for her diplomacy and popularity, according to an April 1996 article about her in The New York Times. ''In a world of whining and complaining, she has wonderful, old-fashioned standards, which have not been deconstructed for modern times,'' the designer Mark Hampton was quoted as saying.         Rella Gammon grew up on a high bluff in Keokuk, Iowa, overlooking the Des Moines and Mississippi Rivers. Her father was an engineer who worked on Route 66. In 1926, she graduated from Lindenwood College in St. Charles, Mo. ''I wanted to be an engineer, build bridges, but my father nixed that,'' she said.         She spent more than a decade as a businesswoman in Detroit that included working as assistant to the president of a manufacturer of cotton batting for auto upholstery. In 1941, she married Allan MacDougall, the president of the National Distillers' import division. She gave up salaried work and became a full-time hostess, traveler and stepmother, occasionally decorating friends' apartments as wedding presents.         In 1964, when a friend's husband died unexpectedly, Mr. MacDougall suggested that she and her friend form a decorating company. ''Allan, I'll sacrifice anything,'' she later recalled telling her husband, ''but I will not go into decorating.'' From 1965 until 1990, she ran MacDougall & Company and worked as a decorator in New York and abroad. Her husband died in 1971.         When she heard about the first  Kips Bay show house in 1972, ''I remember thinking it was the craziest idea I ever heard,'' she said. ''The New York I knew was too sophisticated for that.''         Mrs. MacDougall was best known for sitting by the show house's doorway, graciously greeting visitors with her needlepoint in hand. She summed up her philosophy thus: ''If you don't enjoy it more each year, you shouldn't be doing it.''       
         Marguerite Henry, the author of the children's book classic ''Misty of Chincoteague,'' one of some four dozen books that introduced young readers to animals in the great outdoors, died on Wednesday at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, near San Diego. She was 95.         While much of her work as a professional writer remains highly popular, and in print, it was the tale of ''Misty,'' first published in 1947, that captured the imagination and took on a life of its own. It told of two orphaned siblings drawn to a wild horse on Chincoteague Island, off the Virginia shore. Ms. Henry's colorful story found its way onto film, still seen on television to this day, and made a popular tourist destination of the annual roundup and auction of wild horses on Virginia's barrier islands.         The real Misty died in 1972 but a life-size statue of the horse was recently dedicated at the site of that midsummer roundup, called Pony Penning Day. Ms. Henry spun out further stories about the filly and its young friends, Paul and Mary Beebe, into the 1990's.         She also wrote of wild mustangs, thoroughbreds, Arab stallions, Lippizaners and, notably, Gaudenza, the pride of the Palio, the annual horseback competition in Siena, Italy. She wrote of dogs and all manner of living things in a characteristic style, weaving the romance and history of mankind's association with the animal world into her illustrated texts.         In fact, Ms. Henry was city-bred and came to her love of animals and nature as an adult. The former Marguerite Breithaupt of Milwaukee  caught a whiff of printer's ink in her father's shop, honed her sense of drama in college and discovered the outdoors when she and her husband, Sidney Crocker Henry, a sales manager, moved to a farm in Wayne, Ill.         Her father owned a printing shop and piqued her interest one rainy Sunday by letting her read proofs. She was 10 and decided to become a writer, too. Delineator magazine  published one of her maiden efforts the next year, and paid for it.         ''It was just one step away from heaven,'' she said later.         At Milwaukee State Teachers' College she wrote prodigiously and acted in plays. She married after graduation and took up writing professionally soon after.         Her articles appeared in trade and business periodicals, and then national publications like The Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest. After moving to the farm in 1939, she readily took to country ways and showed it in her first book for children, ''Auno and Tauno: A Story of Finland'' (1940). Next she tackled ''Pictured Geographies,'' a series about Latin American countries for schoolchildren. She also began to write storybooks for the very young, including ''Benjamin West and His Cat Grimalkin''(1947). Researching ''Misty,'' she went to Chincoteague to sit in the sand and sense the island come alive around her.         The same sense of immediacy and adventure characterized her work for four decades. Among the many film and television adaptations that kept her writing alive for new audiences were ''Brighty of the Grand Canyon'' (1967), ''Justin Morgan Had a Horse'' (1972), ''Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion'' (1977), ''Story of a Book'' (1980) and, most recently, her 1948 classic, the adventure tale about a white Arabian horse, ''King of the Wind'' (1990).         ''Misty of Chincoteague'' came to the big screen in 1961 and starred David Ladd and Pam Smith. By then the book that inspired it had sold well over a million copies. Sequels included ''Stormy, Misty's Foal'' (1963) and ''Misty's Twilight'' (1992).         Ms. Henry won many awards, including the John Newbery Honor Award for ''Misty of Chincoteague''  and the Newbery Medal for ''King of the Wind.'' She shared some of them with her illustrators, among them Wesley Dennis and Rich Rudish. Her books were translated into a dozen languages.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dr. Sigrid Phyllis Stearner, who studied the biological effects of radiation and campaigned for career opportunities for scientists with disabilities, died on Nov. 17 at the Illinois Independent Living Center at Naperville, Ill. She was 78.         The cause was pneumonia, friends said.         Dr. Stearner had cerebral palsy as a child and used a motorized wheelchair. She conducted research at the Argonne National Laboratory on the effects of ionizing radiation on the heart and blood vessels until she retired in 1981.         Dr. Stearner was treasurer of the Foundation for Science and the Disabled of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         She was born in Chicago and earned her bachelor's and doctorate at the University of Chicago.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Toni Carabillo, a leader and historian of the modern feminist movement, died on Oct. 28 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said Susie Gilligan of Feminist Majority, a national group that Ms. Carabillo helped found 10 years ago.         Ms. Carabillo, who was co-author of ''Feminist Chronicles, 1953-1993,'' rallied to the feminist cause more than 30 years ago when she joined the National Organization for Women. Under her guidance, NOW branches took root throughout California, and she served over the years as president of the Los Angeles chapter, national vice president, a board member and co-editor of the organization's national newsletter.         She founded Feminist Majority in 1987 together with Eleanor Smeal, Peg Yorkin, Katherine Spillar and Judith Meuli, her companion and partner in a Los Angeles graphic arts business since 1970. The group seeks to encourage women to attain positions of leadership in all walks of life.         The group promotes women who are on their way up as professionals in the private and public sectors. It conducts campus campaigns, makes available internships, compiles statistics and maintains a speakers' bureau.         At her death, Ms. Carabillo was national vice president. Ms. Smeal is president.         ''Feminist Chronicles,'' written with Ms. Meuli and June Csida and published in 1993 by Graphics Press, became a textbook for women's studies in colleges and universities. With Ms. Meuli, Ms. Carabello also wrote ''The Feminization of Power'' (Fund for the Feminist Majority, 1988). Ms. Carabillo had recently been working on ''The Feminist Chronicles of the 20th Century,'' a volume that Ms. Smeal and Ms. Meuli plan to complete.         Ms. Carabillo was born in Jackson Heights, Queens. Majoring in American literature, she graduated from Middlebury College in 1948 and earned a master's degree the next year at Columbia University. She went on to work as a writer and graphic designer.         In 1969, she co-founded the Women's Heritage Corporation, a publishing company. It produced ''Women's Heritage Calendar and Almanac'' and paperbacks about women's rights advocates like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucy Stone.         Ms. Carabillo leaves no immediate family.       
         Lillian B. Miller, a Boston butcher's daughter who made American cultural history her oyster and the Peale family of painters her particular pearls, died on Thursday at a hospital in Washington. She was 74 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         Her family said the cause was a cerebral hemorrhage.         As a man who painted George Washington seven times, Charles Willson Peale has hardly been an unknown figure. But until Dr. Miller came along in 1974 and began turning out volume after annotated volume covering four generations of Peale family papers, Peale had been largely dismissed as little more than a comic footnote to American history, a well-known practical joker whose grandiosely named sons -- Rembrandt, Raphael, Rubens and Titian -- drew scholarly snickers.         Since then, largely because of Dr. Miller's efforts, Peale and the artistic dynasty he established have enjoyed something of a renaissance, one that was underscored in 1986 when a painting by Rembrandt Peale sold for $4 million.         For all her contributions to the Peales' reputation, Dr. Miller was an accidental cultural historian, a woman who cut her own path through the pitfalls of 20th-century American culture.         As the daughter of struggling immigrants from Lithuania, Lillian Beresnack grew up all but oblivious to Boston's cultural riches. Her girlhood passion was literature.         At Radcliffe, as the first member of her family to earn a college degree, she became interested in American history and, while working her way through school as secretary to the head of the Harvard observatory, picked up the skills that would lay the groundwork for her scholarship.         As a Columbia University graduate student, she worked as secretary to the historian Jacques Barzun and the literature professor Lionel Trilling, impressing both scholars so much that when Mary McCarthy abruptly quit her teaching post at Bard College in 1946, they recommended her as a replacement, which is how a 23-year-old secretary came to spend three years teaching literature to returning G.I.'s in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., while making frequent trips back to Columbia to research her master's essay on the Socialist labor leader Eugene V. Debs.         Barzun and Trilling were hardly the only scholars she impressed. At a seminar on American history she caught the eye of a fellow student, Nathan Miller, a budding economic historian who became her husband in 1948.         Dr. Miller spent the 1950's having babies, keeping house in Manhattan and working on her doctoral dissertation. It wasn't easy for a woman to be a scholar in those days, as Dr. Miller discovered when the American Association of University Women rejected her application for a fellowship because she was pregnant.         In 1960, in the pattern of the era, she followed her husband to the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, where he began a long career as a history professor and she helped make feminist history. With the prodding of a sympathetic state attorney general, the university quietly abandoned a nepotism rule, allowing her to teach in the same department with her husband.         Dr. Miller had briefly considered researching the artists project of the Depression-era Works Progress Administration for her dissertation, but when she discovered how little attention had been paid to the role of art in American history, she decided to fill the gap.         When her dissertation, ''Patrons and Patriotism: The Encouragement of Fine Arts in the United States: 1790-1860,'' was published in 1966, it created such a stir that in 1971 the Smithsonian Institution lured her to Washington to become historian of the National Portrait Gallery.         With her husband accommodatingly commuting between Milwaukee and their new home in Bethesda, , Dr. Miller developed major historical exhibitions. Then in 1974, as the Smithsonian's historian of American culture, she published the voluminous Peale family papers on microfiche, providing scholars of diverse fields with a trove of source material and giving her a life's work.         Dr. Miller, who organized an acclaimed traveling exhibition of Peale works last year, published four of a projected seven volumes of Peale family papers.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Miller is survived by a son, Joel, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Hannah Lieberman of Phoenix and Rebecca Miller-Randall of Chester, Conn.; four sisters, Elsie Hurst and Edith Sahl of Newton, Mass., Ginger Lanahan of Raynham, Mass., and Dorothy Bearman of London, and six grandchildren.       
         Rosemarie Rogers, a scholar of international migrations and former academic dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, died on Nov. 28 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 61.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone-marrow cancer, said her husband, Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering at Harvard University.         Dr. Rogers was a native of Austria, and her fluency in several languages led her to a career in international relations. She lectured in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving to the Fletcher School, where she advanced to a full professorship and served as academic dean from 1985 to 1987.         Her more than 50 papers, monographs, book chapters and books reflected her research on international migrations, including forced migrations and refugee policies.         At her death she was completing a comparative study of the migration policy of six Western European countries. In it she documented the difficulties host countries have, on the one hand, encouraging migrants to return home, and on the other, integrating them into their own societies.         Her recent research was foreshadowed in an earlier book, ''Guests Come to Stay: The Effects of European Labor Migration on Sending and Receiving Countries'' (1985). Another volume, written with Emily Copeland, ''Forced Migration: Policy Issues in the Post-Cold War World'' (1993), was widely distributed by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and various national governments.         Dr. Rogers was born Rosemarie Straussnigg in Klagenfurt, Austria, and studied at the Universities of Vienna and Innsbruck, the University of Texas and the Sorbonne. She settled in the United States in 1958 and earned a doctorate in political science at M.I.T. in 1967.         She served on the board of the World Peace Foundation.         Besides her husband, Dr. Rogers is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Cambridge, and Justin, of Albuquerque, N.M.       
         Janet Annenberg Hooker, whose many philanthropies ranged from the support of musical organizations to the redecoration of The White House and the diplomatic rooms of the State Department in Washington, died Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and had homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hooker was one of the principal benefactors of the National Museum of Natural History, the largest of the Smithsonian Institution's family of museum buildings on the Mall in Washington. She contributed $5 million for the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, which opened this fall. The $10 million gallery has a walk-through mine, interactive exhibits and high-resolution videos of earthquakes and volcanic action.         A spectacular gem collection housed in the new building includes several other gifts from Mrs. Hooker, among them the Hooker Starburst Diamonds, which she donated  in 1994 in honor of her two sons, Gilbert S. Kahn and Donald P. Kahn. The dazzling set of rare yellow diamonds, cut in a starburst pattern, includes a 245-carat necklace with 50 rectangular diamonds, a 61-carat diamond ring and earrings. Each earring is a 25-carat yellow diamond surrounded by four pear-shaped and 16 baguette white diamonds.         In 1977, Mrs. Hooker also gave the Smithsonian a 75-carat emerald brooch. The half-million-dollar brooch, set with diamonds, was once owned by the Sultan of Turkey, who sported it on his belt buckle. Mrs. Hooker's son, Gilbert S. Kahn, said that his mother's total contribution to the Smithsonian, in cash and jewels, was about $9 million.         When the diplomatic reception rooms of the State Department building were rebuilt in the mid-1980's, Clement Conger, the curator at the time, described Mrs. Hooker as the project's ''staunchest supporter.'' The almost $8 million renovation, paid for with private funds, included the $3.5 million, 47-by-102-foot Benjamin Franklin Dining Room and the Secretary of State's $1.95 million, 10-room suite.         ''Mother was always interested in the decorative arts,'' Mr. Kahn said. He noted that during her winters in Palm Beach, she met and became friendly with a number of ambassadors who were guests at the annual Red Cross Ball, and this heightened  her interest in the effort to enhance the State Department building.         Mrs. Hooker also contributed $250,000 to renovate the Blue Room in the White House and contributed to the fund for the redecoration of the private quarters there. Her interest in the White House Preservation Fund extended through the administrations of six Presidents -- John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.         Mrs. Hooker, her brother, Walter Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and Mr. Annenberg's wife, Lenore, jointly contributed $200,000 in 1987 to the renovation of Blair-Lee House. The gift was for a garden room in a new wing of the government's guest house.         Mrs. Hooker was also an active presence on the social scene in both New York and Florida. One of her principal activities on the charity circuit was the fashionable April in Paris Ball in New York, a benefit affair for French and American organizations. For many years, she not only underwrote the cost of the decorations but also planned and assisted in their placement.         A number of musical institutions also were the recipients of Mrs. Hooker's beneficence. She donated a section of the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center in honor of her mother, Mrs. Moses L. Annenberg, and she contributed over the years to the New York Philharmonic, the Musicians Emergency Fund and to various outdoor concert programs.         Although Mrs. Hooker bought a house in Newport, R.I., in 1992, her health began deteriorating and she never lived in it. ''You finish it and enjoy it,'' she told her son Gilbert. She and her son, however, gave a suite of Louis XV-style furniture to The Elms, one of Newport's famed ''cottages,'' built in 1901 and modeled after the Chateau d' Asineres near Paris. The suite consisted of 12 chairs, a small sofa and a fire screen, covered with 18th-century Beauvais tapestry and framed in gilt carved with trailing garlands and scallop shells. Janet Hooker's name is also on a plaque listing the major donors to the restoration of the house and gardens of the painter Claude Monet in Giverny, France.         Mrs. Hooker was born in Chicago on Oct. 13, 1904, one of seven daughters of Moses Annenberg, the founder of Triangle Publications, and Sadie Annenberg. Three of the publications -- T.V. Guide, The Daily Racing Form and Seventeen Magazine -- were sold to Rupert Murdoch for $3 billion in 1988.         According to a 1990 article in Forbes Magazine, Mrs. Hooker and two of her sisters, Esther Simon and Lita Hazen, both now deceased, were major beneficiaries of the sale. The magazine reported that two sisters, Enid Haupt and Evelyn Hall, had previously cashed in most of their stock. The other two sisters, Pearl (Polly) Levee and Harriette Ames, were deceased. The surviving sisters, and families of the deceased, were also reported to have shared in the proceeds of the sale of General Motors stock valued at $825 million.         Mrs. Hooker was educated at Kemper Hall, an Episcopal school in Kenosha, Wis. An outgoing woman with a determined will and a quiet sense of humor, she tapped into the family tradition of charity as a young bride. Her early grants were primarily in the field of music. Later, her major contributions reflected her interest in the decorative arts.         In 1924 she was married to L. Stanley Kahn, a publisher in the Annenberg communications empire. The couple divorced in 1937 and in the same year Mrs. Hooker, under the name of Janet Kahn, began a brief stage career. She appeared as a school trustee in ''Honor Bright,'' a play produced by Lee Shubert that was mounted in Detroit and Rhode Island but never came to New York. The following year, she married Joseph A. Neff of Lincoln, Neb., who had been in the clothing business in the West and later was involved in the sale of the Cleveland Plain Dealer to S.I. Newhouse. Mr. Neff died in 1969.         Her marriage to James Stewart Hooker took place in 1974. Mr. Hooker was head of labor relations for the Philadelphia Inquirer, an Annenberg newspaper at the time. Her son Gilbert said that the two met at business meetings and that the friendship evolved into a love match. Mr. Hooker died in 1976.         In addition to her two sons, Gilbert Kahn of Newport, R.I., and Miami, and Donald Kahn of Salzburg and London, she is survived by her two sisters, Enid Haupt of New York and Evelyn Hall of Palm Beach; her brother, Walter Annenberg of Philadelphia and Palm Springs, Calif.;  five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 17, 1997, Wednesday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker was published in error. It showed her sister Lita Annenberg Hazen, a patron of medical research and cultural institutions who died in 1995.         Correction:  December 19, 1997, Friday  An obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker on Tuesday misstated the ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1974, when Ms. Hooker married James Stewart Hooker, an executive there. The paper was owned by the Knight chain, which merged that year to form Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc.; it was not an Annenberg paper at the time.       
         Esther Peterson, a dogged consumer advocate whose work has an impact on Americans every time they buy a can of soup or a box of laundry detergent, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Peterson served in the Administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and worked for businesses as well. Among her accomplishments was the labeling of foods with their nutritional value, so that shoppers can determine whether so many vitamins and proteins are worth their price in calories.         Similarly, she successfully advocated that products be priced per unit, so that a calculator was not needed to figure out whether 14.5 ounces of breakfast cereal at $4.29 or 15.75 ounces at $4.59 is the better buy.         And she accomplished those things with a gentle cajoling that masked an iron determination. At a party marking Mrs. Peterson's 90th birthday last year, Lynda Johnson Robb recalled the help that her father, President Johnson, got from Mrs. Peterson, and said, ''She had a velvet hammer and talked people into doing what was right, even if we didn't know it at the time.''         In her long career, in which she was active until just recently, Mrs. Peterson was an educator, a labor organizer, a public official and an advocate of women's rights.         She organized a strike in Boston in the 1930's among women who sewed aprons at home and were forced by their employer to switch from square pockets to heart-shaped ones, which were more difficult to cut and sew, without any increase in wages.         ''She won the strike,'' her son Iver said over the weekend, ''after she told the women to picket the boss but to dress nicely, because the police in Boston used to back their horses into pickets, 'but if you are properly dressed, the police won't do it.' ''         Mrs. Peterson was born in 1906 in Provo, Utah, to two immigrants from Denmark, Lars Eggertsen, the local superintendent of schools, and his wife, Annie, who, according to her son, ''kept boarders because they didn't pay superintendents much in those days.''         She received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in 1927 and a master's from Teachers' College, Columbia University, in 1930. She held several teaching positions in the 1930's, including one at the innovative Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which brought milliners, telephone operators and garment workers onto the campus.         A Bryn Mawr College official described the school as a place ''not only to teach but to learn from the women workers the problems that together they and we must solve,'' but her son said that Mrs. Peterson's description was more succinct: a place that combined Shakespeare, drama and socialism.         She worked for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the American Federation of Teachers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. In 1961, President Kennedy named her an Assistant Secretary of Labor and Director of the Women's Bureau, an agency that administered the labor laws concerning women.         When Mr. Johnson became President, he brought Mrs. Peterson into the White House as his special adviser for consumer affairs, and she served in a similar capacity for President Carter.         In 1971, at the age of 65, Mrs. Peterson started another career, this time in business as vice president for consumer affairs at Giant Food Inc., the largest supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area.         Odonna Mathews, who worked with Mrs. Peterson as a University of Maryland undergraduate intern and now holds Mrs. Peterson's old position at Giant, said: ''Her friends in consumer activism asked, 'How can you work for a business and represent the consumer?' She showed it could be done.''         At Giant, Ms. Mathews said, she worked with Mrs. Peterson on the grade labeling of food. ''She found it confusing,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She asked, 'What's the difference between U.S. Fancy No. 1 and Extra Fancy?' ''         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson persuaded the supermarket to disclose what seafood had been previously frozen, a widespread practice now but one not in use before then.         ''She got Giant to try nutritional labeling on its private products before it was required by Federal law, comparing calories and proteins,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She got Giant to use open dating -- putting a date by which products like yogurt or milk must be sold.''         Before then, the stores used letter and number combinations to express the dates, a code that was not clear to buyers.         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson visited Giant stores often and was easily recognized by shoppers. She was tall, about 5 feet 10 inches, and she wore her long braided gray hair in a distinctive upsweep on the top of her head, a style described by her children as a ''Gretchen braid.''         Her photograph appeared in many of Giant's advertisements, including one in April 1972 when a shortage of beef caused its price to rocket and Mrs. Peterson urged the supermarket chain's customers to avoid beef purchases until the price came down.         ''You have a right to be informed about meat prices,'' a Giant advertisement said. ''We consumers can help bring prices down. Buy less meat. Use other forms of protein.''         The advertisement listed alternatives to meat like beans and lentils and was signed by Mrs. Peterson.         Mrs. Peterson later was hired by the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents as its consumer adviser, concerning herself particularly with the problems of older people, and she continued to keep a foot in both camps, serving on the board of Consumers Union.         She ended her public service career under yet another Democratic President, serving in a largely honorary role for the Clinton Administration with the United States Delegation to the United Nations.         Besides her son Iver, of Lawrenceville, N.J., who is a reporter for The New York Times, Mrs. Peterson is survived by two other sons, Eric N.,  of Alexandria, Va., and Lars E., of Washington; a daughter, Karen K. Wilken of Fort Collins, Colo., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Ruth G. Weintraub, an early advocate of graduate education for women and a former dean at Hunter College, died Wednesday at her home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She was 92.         Dr. Weintraub, who also kept a home on Fire Island in Seaview, was a professor of political science at Hunter from 1951 to 1972. After retiring from academia, she had a second career with the Academy for Educational Development in Manhattan, starting as a consultant. The academy is a nonprofit organization that undertakes education projects.         She founded its Presidential Services Division in 1974 and was executive vice president of the academy from 1978 to 1988. Through the division, she helped recruit presidents for colleges around the country. She retired in 1988.         Born in New York and a lifelong resident, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College in 1929, and in 1931, she became one of the first women to finish New York University Law School with a J.D. She earned a Ph.D. in political science at Columbia University in 1939.         She joined the Hunter faculty as an instructor after her graduation in 1929 and advanced to full professor in 1951. In 1956, she became dean of graduate studies in the arts and sciences, and she held the post until 1968.         Dr. Weintraub was also chairwoman of the department of political science until 1960 and then associate dean of graduate studies at City University of New York until 1968. After that she was dean of social sciences for her four final years at Hunter.         She was president of Pi Sigma Alpha, the first woman to head that political science honor society, which has chapters at 107 institutions of higher education nationwide. She also was active as an officer in the American Society for Public Administration, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Jewish Welfare Board and the YM-YWHA of Greater New York.         Her husband, Dr. Solomon Weintraub, a pathologist, died in 1982 after 52 years of marriage. She is survived by a son, Jon, of Washington, and two grandchildren.       
         Amanda Pirie Warrington, an equestrian, died yesterday at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del., of injuries she received after falling from her horse while competing at the Fair Hill horse trials in Maryland. She was 29 and lived in Unionville, Pa.         Mrs. Warrington was considered  one of the top riders in the country in the three-day event. In that Olympic equestrian discipline, the horse and rider are called on to perform a prescribed set of movements called  dressage; a speed and endurance test, which involves jumping a set of fixed obstacles in the countryside, and show jumping.         She represented the United States in 1996 at the Blenheim Castle three-day event in England; also that year she won the fall national championship three-day event of the United States equestrian team at Fair Hill. Earlier this year she won the Essex three-day event in Gladstone, N.J.         She was born on Aug. 22, 1968, in Boston, the daughter of Robert S. Pirie, vice chairman of investment banking at Societe Generale Securities Corporation, and Deirdre H. Pirie, also an equestrian. She was  educated at Marlboro College in Marlboro, Vt., and was married in June 1993 to Daniel L. Warrington, a race horse trainer.         In addition to her parents, of Hamilton, Mass., and her husband, she is survived by a sister, Sophie Clifton of Bozeman, Mont., and a brother, John Pirie of Hamilton.       
         Jeannette Edris Rockefeller, a lifelong volunteer and philanthropist, a former First Lady of Arkansas and stepmother of its current Lieutenant Governor, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif., where she had lived for nearly 10 years. She was 79.         Mrs. Rockefeller took part in a wide variety of public causes while her husband, Winthrop Rockefeller, was in office, transforming the role of First Lady in Arkansas into a public partnership.         She was the second wife of Mr. Rockefeller, the first Republican Governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction, who served two terms, from 1967 to 1970. They divorced a year later. Mr. Rockefeller died in 1973.         President Clinton, one of his successors in Little Rock, said Mrs. Rockefeller had helped to take the ''New South'' to Arkansas and to lead women into the mainstream of political and public life.         ''She spearheaded education and cultural outreach across the state through the Arkansas Arts Center,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House. He called her ''a strong voice against discrimination.''         Mrs. Rockefeller was an important backer of a Martin Luther King Memorial Service on the State Capitol steps after Dr. King was assassinated in 1968. The rally, attended by thousands of people, helped defuse what might have been a tense situation in the state.         A native of Seattle, Mrs. Rockefeller studied at the University of Washington and Finch College in New York, majoring in psychology. She met Winthrop Rockefeller while working with teen-age drug addicts and mentally ill children in New York, and they married in 1956.         Mrs. Rockefeller was president of the National Mental Health Association and the Arkansas Association for Mental Health. She served on the national board of the Urban League and the White House Commission on Mental Health under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. More recently she headed the AIDS Assistance Project in Palm Springs.         In addition to her stepson, Lieut. Gov. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, her survivors include a son and daughter from another marriage, Bruce Bartley of Little Rock, and Anne Bartley McNeil of San Francisco.       
         Mildred Mosler Weisenfeld, who helped build an organization for researching blindness, died last Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was complications of lung cancer, said Dr. Kenneth R. Barasch, national president of the Fight for Sight, an organization through which she raised money.         Ms. Weisenfeld, who lost her eyesight at 25 as a result of retinitis pigmentosa, began her effort as the National Council to Combat Blindness in 1946. Starting with $8 of her own but no office door on which to hang a sign, she soon transformed it into the Fight for Sight Inc. Her campaign became a national group that has awarded grants that total more than $13 million.         Ms. Weisenfeld was chief organizer and executive director over 50 years, often working 12-hour days. The money enabled the Fight for Sight to provide 40 grants a year totaling $400,000. Additional aid goes to five children's eye clinics, in New York City, Newark, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, including the Fight For Sight clinic in the Harkness Institute at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.         The group sponsors grants and postdoctoral and student fellowships, as well as backing basic research proposed by vision specialists early in their careers. According to Dr. Barasch, the money let many recipients to become prominent in the field.         The projects have contributed directly and indirectly to advances made in areas like lens implants, the preservation of donated corneas, laser techniques and treatments to slow glaucoma.         Ms. Weisenfeld was born in Brooklyn. She attended Brooklyn College in the early 40's. In 1936, she was given a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa, when she was 15. The hereditary degenerative disease causes night blindness, retinal pigmentation changes, narrowing of the visual field and, eventually, blindness.         As her condition worsened, Ms. Weisenfeld found that much remained unknown about the disease. Her initiative won the attention of Congress in 1949, when she coordinated testimony on eye research before the House.         The hearings led Congress to recognize eye disease as a factor when it created the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness. That move, again with her encouragement, led to the establishment of a separate National Eye Institute in the National Institutes of Health.         In 1956, she married Albert G. Mosler, a businessman from Philadelphia who was blinded by retinitis pigmentosa. He died in 1967. There are no immediate survivors.
