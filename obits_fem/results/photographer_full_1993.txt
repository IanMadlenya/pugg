         Lacey Fosburgh, a writer whose books chronicled murder, family passions and mystery in India, died last night at California Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. She was 50 years old and lived in Mill Valley, Calif.         Ms. Fosburgh, who began her writing career as a reporter for The New York Times, died of complications of breast cancer, said a friend of the family.         Ms. Fosburgh's books were the nonfiction "Closing Time" (1977) and the novels "Old Money" (1983), about a woman photographer's painful relationship with her father, and "India Gate" (1991), a sprawling, passionate novel set in India. At her death, she was writing a novel set in present-day New York City under contract to Simon & Schuster.         She was a staff reporter for the Times from 1968 to late 1973. In the last 20 years, she also wrote freelance newspaper and magazine articles, many of them for The Times, taught journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and was a consultant to newspapers, among them The Oakland Tribune.  Murder and Mysteries         A 1973 murder case about which Ms. Fosburgh wrote for The Times became the subject of "Closing Time," which was a selection of the Literary Guild and the Doubleday Book Club. It won a Mystery Writers of America award.         The murder victim was a troubled teacher, Roseann Quinn. The police said she took an Indiana drifter, John Wayne Wilson, home to her apartment on West 72d Street in Manhattan from a nearby singles bar. They said her body had been sexually mutilated. After being held five months on murder charges, Mr. Wilson hanged himself in his jail cell.         In "Contemporary Authors," a series of reference books, Truman Capote is quoted as remarking that the book showed that Ms. Fosburgh "is a skillful, selective reporter and also a literary artist."         Ms. Fosburgh was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Hugh Whitney Fosburgh, a journalist and author who died in 1976, and Helen Edwards Fosburgh. Through her paternal grandmother, Leila Whitney Fosburgh, Ms. Fosburgh was descended from the Whitney family. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and Sarah Lawrence College. She was a debutante at a dinner-dance at the St. Regis Hotel. From 1964 to 1966 she studied in New Delhi on a Fulbright grant.         Her 1973 marriage to Marc Libarle ended in divorce in 1975.         She is survived by her second husband, David Harris, a writer who was a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, whom she wed in 1977; a daughter from her second marriage, Sophie Whitney Harris of Mill Valley; her mother, who lives in Manhattan, and a brother, Pieter, of Manhattan.

         Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.         "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."         Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.  Advocate of an Early Start         "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.         Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."         After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.         Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."         Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.         Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.         "I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."         Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.         Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."         Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.         Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.         At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.         When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway. She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith         In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.         That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.         He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.         That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.         In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit. One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts         Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.         During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.         Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.         First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.         "In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."         Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.  Propaganda Films For World War I         During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.         Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.         In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.         Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.         The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."         "Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."         With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."         In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.         Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad. From the Silents To the Talkies         Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.         Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.         As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."         Correction:  March 2, 1993, Tuesday         A picture in some copies yesterday with an obituary of Lillian Gish, showing a scene from "Life With Father," was published in error. It showed Dorothy Gish.       
         Lona Foote, a photographer known for her portraits of jazz musicians, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 42.         The cause was breast cancer, said a friend, Howard Mandel.         Ms. Foote was born in New York, and she developed a special interest in the avant-garde. At ease with both musicians and dancers, she made her way around New York on her bicycle, photographing artistic activity at performance spaces from the Village Vanguard to P.S. 122.         For the last 15 years, Ms. Foote worked at the Experimental Intermedia Foundation and also as a freelance photographer. Her work was published in The New York Times, The Village Voice, Downbeat and Ear. One of her last assignments was photographing artists for Arabesque Record's new jazz series. Among the jazz figures she photographed are Walter Davis Jr., Henry Threadgill, Lawrence (Butch) Morris, Abbey Lincoln and Marilyn Crispell.         She is survived by two sisters, Naomi Kennis of Glendale, Ariz., and Regan Levin of Staten Island, and her parents, Ronald and Mona Foote of South Carolina.       
         Beryl Emmer Menon, a journalist who edited the staff newspaper of Unicef, the United Nations relief organization, and who traveled and wrote widely in India and the Himalayas, died on Oct. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 50.         She had decided to discontinue kidney dialysis after 19 years of treatment, friends said.         Ms. Menon began her career as a freelance writer and photographer in Asia in the late 1960's after graduating with a journalism degree from New York University. She was a contributor to Ms. magazine, The Calcutta Statesman and The Bengali-American Reporter, taking assignments in Sikkim, Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which was then closed to outsiders by order of the Indian Government.         Indian officials began proceedings to deport Ms. Menon from Calcutta because of her violation of the travel ban, but she was allowed to remain after she married Bhaskar P. Menon, then a columnist for The Calcutta Statesman.         She returned to New York with her husband in 1970 and for the next three years worked as a reporter for The Record of Bergen County, N.J. In 1973, after learning she had kidney disease, she decided to travel again, to Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan.         In 1986, she became editor of Staff News, which is distributed to Unicef's employees around the world. She served in this position until last year.         She is survived by two brothers, William Kartel of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Ted Kartofsky of Manhattan, and a sister, Sandra Kartfel of San Francisco.       
         Gertrude Blom, a Swiss-born sociologist and photographer who spent five decades documenting the Mayan cultures of southern Mexico, died on Thursday in San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico. She was 92.         An associate of Mrs. Blom told Reuters the cause was pneumonia, secondary to heart disease.         Mrs. Blom, who was also a journalist, anthropologist and explorer, spent most of her time in San Cristbal de las Casas in the southern state of Chiapas.         There she documented contrasting cultures of two Mayan peoples, one in the highlands, the second in the Lacandona jungle along the border with Guatemala, showing what they have adopted from modern society and what they have kept of their own cultures.         She chronicled the lives of the second group through the creation of the Na Bolom Cultural Association.         The headquarters of the association, whose name is Mayan for "house of the jaguar," contained her home, a library and a museum about the vast jungle, which became a focal point for environmental and anthropological research into the Mayan culture. The complex also contained an inn for visitors and volunteer workers who came to live there for short periods.         In recent years several exhibits of her photographs of the Mayans have been held in Manhattan, the latest this fall in the International Center of Photography at 1130 Fifth Avenue.         Born in Bern, Mrs. Blom went to Mexico in 1940 with her husband, Franz Blom, a Danish archeologist and cartographer. They explored the Lacandona jungle for the first time three years later. During the next 20 years, until Mr. Blom's death in 1963, their explorations led to the discovery of many important Mayan ruins.         Together they worked to preserve the jungle and its rich biosphere. However, associates said that in recent years Mrs. Blom had been despondent about the deforestation that was shrinking the Lacandona and wiping out the culture of its inhabitants.         Correction:  January 1, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Wednesday about Gertrude Blom summarized her career incompletely. In addition to being a journalist, photographer and anthropologist, she was also a horticulturist. The obituary also misspelled the name of one of the Mayan jungles in which she worked. It was the Lacandon jungle. The article also referred incorrectly to the circumstances of her marriage. She and her husband married in 1943 after meeting on an expedition in Mexico.
