         Dr. Alma Hawkins, a pioneering modern-dance educator who founded the dance department at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Jan. 8 at her home in Santa Monica. She was 94.         Born in Rolla, Mo., Dr. Hawkins graduated from the University of Missouri and went on to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she became interested in modern dance. She trained in dance at Bennington College and in Colorado before earning master's and doctor's degrees at Columbia.         She taught at Emporia State University in Kansas and George Williams College in Chicago before joining the dance program at U.C.L.A.; she was its chairwoman from 1953 to her retirement in 1977.         In 1962, Dr. Hawkins established an autonomous dance department, equal in status to the departments of art, music and theater arts, at the College of Fine Arts at the university.         According to the University of California at Los Angeles, it was the nation's first university dance department, eventually offering degrees in dance therapy, dance history, esthetics and education as well as choreography and performance.         Dr. Hawkins encouraged the establishment of an interdepartmental program in ethnic arts that later became the world arts and cultures program. She worked closely with dance presenters to bring leading American and foreign troupes to perform at Royce Hall at the university.         In 1967, she formed the Council of Dance Administrators, a product of a national conference on dance sponsored by the arts and humanities division of the United States Office of Education.         The council published ''Standards for Dance Major Programs'' of colleges in 1979, leading to a national dance certification program. Also in 1967, Dr. Hawkins founded the West Coast Dance Film Archives. She later founded the national Council of Graduate Dance/Movement Therapy Educators.         Dr. Hawkins was a dance therapist and researcher at the university's Neuropsychiatric Institute from 1960 to 1977, training dance therapists and creating a series of educational research films about the field. On her retirement from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hawkins taught for more than 10 years in the dance department at Santa Monica College.         She is survived by her sister, Alice Hawkins of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Edith Oliver, a diminutive, raspy-voiced and highly influential drama critic at The New Yorker for more than three decades who got her start writing questions for radio quiz shows, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         ''She was packaged like the quintessential elderly lady that a Boy Scout would help across the street, except that she drank martinis, smoked cigarettes and could, on occasion, have a mouth like a sailor,'' said George White, chairman and founder of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, where Miss Oliver served as a dramaturge for 20 seasons at its National Playwrights Conference in Waterford, Conn. ''She could be tough and would brook no banality, but she truly loved playwrights and loved the theater.''         Born in New York to parents she later described as ''stage-struck,'' Miss Oliver remembered seeing her first show at the age of 5. After attending Smith College, she studied acting at the Berkshire Playhouse in Stockbridge, Mass., and began performing on radio shows, including ''Gangbusters,'' ''Crime Doctor'' and the ''Philip Morris Playhouse.''         From 1937 until 1941, she wrote the radio quiz show ''True or False?,'' and for a dozen years, beginning in 1940, she wrote and eventually also produced ''Take It or Leave It: The $64 Question.''         Miss Oliver began contributing to The New Yorker in 1947 and joined the staff in 1961 as a movie and theater critic, eventually becoming among the most influential voices covering Off Broadway theater.         ''Off Broadway was the love of my life,'' she said in a 1992 interview. ''I was young enough to be all over town, four or five nights a week. The thrill was Harlem in the 60's, for the music and the theater.''         She also ran the magazine's book department for many years, while continuing to write.         ''She was a person of great wit, great sardonic and satiric wit and yet very generous at the same time,'' said Lloyd Richards, the veteran stage director and longtime artistic director of the National Playwrights Conference. ''You didn't puff yourself up in front of Edith. She could prick the balloon.''         In 1987 she began to share the coverage of Broadway shows for The New Yorker, first with Mimi Kramer and then with John Lahr. She retired in 1992. But for three more years, Miss Oliver continued to take part in the summer conference at the O'Neill Center, where she was a feisty and sometimes profane figure.         Despite her frank language, Miss Oliver said she would never allow any coarseness to sneak into her New Yorker copy. ''I can't compromise the magazine's standards of civility,'' she once said.         Woodie King, artistic director at the New Federal Theater, said, ''For our first 15 years of existence, she covered all of our productions and gave us and other theater groups a visibility that we would not have had otherwise.''         He added: ''She always supported innovative writing. Even late in life, when it was difficult for her to get around, you would always see her there.''         She is survived by a brother, Robert Goldsmith of Harwich, Mass.         During a 1989 critics' roundtable in Manhattan, Miss Oliver described her approach to her work. ''I think of myself as a member of the audience,'' she said. ''And I try to maintain that attitude until the curtain comes down. I don't want to deprive myself of any surprises.''         She could be very hard on playwrights, but told an interviewer that she tried always to be gentle with actors.         ''I have the greatest sympathy for actors and their problems,'' she said. ''They don't need me to add to their burden.''       
         Dr. Mary Catherine Raugust Howell, a pediatrician who championed medical careers and better health care for women and who was the first woman to become an associate dean at Harvard Medical School, died yesterday at her home in Watertown, Mass. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Howell attracted the attention of a male-dominated establishment in 1973 with an ironically titled critique of the status quo, ''Why Would a Girl Go into Medicine? Medical Education in the United States: A Guide for Women'' (Feminist Press). Since Dr. Howell was a Harvard associate dean at the time, she decided to publish it under the pen name Margaret A. Campbell.         Her study of discrimination against women in medical schools, she declared in her foreword, was written ''to inform and encourage women medical students of the past, present and future and to promote radical change in medical education and in the care of patients.''         While quotas were not acknowledged in the admissions offices of medical schools, she wrote, practice suggested otherwise. A ''man doctor, woman nurse'' mentality reigned, she said, and with it the attitude that it was imprudent to waste expensive medical school training on a woman if she was unlikely to practice the profession because of marriage and  motherhood.         Dr. Howell acknowledged authorship of the book a few years later.  Her facts and figures were used as  ammunition by many groups pressing to gain a fairer role for women in the medical field. The prospects of women in medicine were eventually enhanced by Federal legislation against sex discrimination.         Dr. Howell was also active in the women's health movement. She was  a founding member of the National Women's Health Network, which was formed in the 1970's to lobby for better health care for women.         ''By 1975,'' said Cynthia Pearson, the network's executive director, ''there were over 2,000 community-based women's health groups that either provided direct services and education and an alternative to traditional male-dominated medical care or were engaged in efforts to change the system. Mary helped organize the first national women's health conference, which brought individual women and representatives of grass-roots women's health groups to the Harvard campus.''         Dr. Howell also contributed to Working Mother magazine and to ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' from the Boston Women's Book Collective, whose 25th anniversary update was published by Touchstone in 1996.         Mary Catherine Raugust was born on Sept. 2, 1932, in Grand Forks, N. D., the daughter of a businessman and a former public-school teacher. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1954, studied linguistics and originally wanted to become a musician. She married Robert Jordan of Weston, Conn., and had a son, Nicholas, but the marriage failed. She then decided to become a pediatrician.         ''She started to think she wanted to care for kids and went into pre-med,'' said Samuel Howell, her son by a second marriage. ''She was always very concerned about children and the institutional way in which medicine treats them. She fought against that all her life, trying to de-institutionalize medicine.''         In interviews later in her life, Dr. Howell told of the slights, condescension, jokes and outright hostility she endured as a medical student and intern from school administrators, faculty members and male students. Even female patients often feared that a female doctor was inherently inferior, Dr. Howell said.         But, persisting, she earned a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and an M.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1962; she earned a doctor of laws degree at Harvard University in 1991.         Dr. Howell trained in pediatrics, psychotherapy, bioethics and geriatrics at various institutions as she pursued her career as a practicing doctor and educator, starting as an instructor in child development at Minnesota in 1962. She joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an instructor in pediatrics in 1969, rising to become an assistant professor of pediatrics and chief of the behavior unit in the Children's Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital.         Dr. Howell was appointed associate dean for student affairs in 1972, becoming the highest-ranking woman at the medical school at the time, and served until 1975. She viewed her appointment as a kind of tokenism.         ''Prior to my appointment,'' she said in an interview in 1979, ''a committee of students and faculty had asserted the need for a woman administrator, and Harvard got tremendous mileage out of my appointment. Student affairs are traditionally places where your job is to keep students quiet and out of everyone's hair. The administration expected us to act as student pacifiers rather than student advocates.''         Shortly after her appointment, Dr. Howell sent out questionnaires to female medical students throughout  the country, asking them about their status and attitudes toward them. Their responses reminded her of her own painful journey to become a doctor, she said, and she decided to use them as the basis for what became her book for Feminist Press.         After leaving Harvard in 1975, she had a pediatric practice in York, Me.,  for a year. Based on her experiences there, she wrote another book, ''Healing at Home: A Guide to Health Care for Children'' (Beacon Press, 1978) She returned to the Boston area to practice pediatrics and psychotherapy.         From 1992 to 1994, she was a member of the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School.         Dr. Howell's second marriage, to Dr. A. Ervin Howell of Fairmont, Minn., ended in divorce.         In addition to her sons Nicholas Jordan, of Weston, Conn., and Samuel Howell, of Manhattan, she is survived by three other sons, Aaron Howell, of Medford, Mass., Eli Howell, of Eugene, Ore., and Ned Raugust, of Concord, Mass.; two daughters, Sarah Howell, of Framingham, Mass., and Eve Howell, of Boston; a brother, Tony Raugust of Minneapolis, and one granddaughter.       
         Belle Zeller, an emeritus professor of political science at Brooklyn College and a scholar of the legislative process who was an indomitable leader of unions representing City University of New York professors for more than 30 years, died on Friday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass.         From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress.         As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol.         ''When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,'' said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ''She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist.''         Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age.         She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors.         In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.         Her doctoral dissertation, ''Pressure Politics in New York'' (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act.         Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.         Dr. Zeller never married. In addition to Ms. Glass, she is survived by four other nieces and a nephew.       
         Nicole Maxwell, a free-spirited San Francisco debutante who plunged into the remote Amazon jungles of Ecuador and Peru and came out with a trove of medicinal plants that she said Indians used to cure virtually every known ailment, died on May 5 in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 92, and left no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Maxwell, the author of the 1961 book ''Witch Doctor's Apprentice,'' had spent the last decades of her life in largely vain efforts to interest drug companies in her discoveries.         For a woman who was the toast of Paris in the 1920's, dancing ballet with the Opera, dallying with a raft of admirers and posing nude for artists, Mrs. Maxwell made an abrupt change in her life: After a 12-year marriage to an Air Force officer ended in 1945 (''I married a lieutenant and divorced a brigadier general''), she headed to South America to visit friends in Bolivia, later saying that since she had never been attracted to Latin men, she hoped to avoid distracting entanglements.         Whatever the distractions, Mrs. Maxwell stayed in South America for 12 years, running the first shoe-string tourist service in Lima, Peru, and later becoming a roving correspondent for The Lima Times.         It was during a chance venture into the jungle on a visit to Quito, Ecuador, in 1947 that Mrs. Maxwell first became fascinated with the jungles of the upper Amazon basin and its indigenous tribes.         Hacking her way through the jungle with an Indian guide the next year, she suffered a deep machete gash on her arm and made the discovery that would change her life.         With Mrs. Maxwell wondering whether she would bleed to death or die from infection, the guide ran into the jungle, returned with some dark red tree sap and had her drink it. When the bleeding stopped within minutes and the wound healed rapidly without a scar, Mrs. Maxwell knew she had found her life's work: ferreting out remedies used by the Indians for centuries and introducing them to the modern world.         The very idea of medicine struck a chord deep in her psyche. Growing up in a wealthy Christian Science family in San Francisco, Mrs. Maxwell had harbored a grudge against the religion ever since she broke her arm when she was 9 and was denied medical treatment until she went to a doctor on her own.         It was a streak of independence that would resurface a few years later when she contracted a teen-age marriage of convenience simply to escape her family, then obtained a divorce as soon as the couple reached Paris.         During her later marriage, when her Air Force husband was posted to Cambridge, Mass., Mrs. Maxwell talked the chairman of the Harvard biology department into helping her sign up for postgraduate courses.         By the time her husband was transferred to Ohio, Harvard professors had arranged for her to continue her studies at Ohio State. But when her husband was transferred to Washington a couple of years later, her unofficial formal education came to an end because Georgetown University would not admit women.         In the decade after her machete experience, Mrs. Maxwell made dozens of expeditions to the remotest regions of the upper Amazon, befriending the local Indians and slowly learning the secrets of their vast medical lore. To Indians whose experience with outsiders had been as victims of armed rubber merchants, an unarmed woman posed no threat.         In 1958, after obtaining a small grant from a drug company, Mrs. Maxwell made a special expedition, obtaining samples of many of the plants whose medicinal properties she had been carefully cataloguing.         When she returned and shipped her plants, including what she said was a variety of highly effective contraceptives, to the drug company, she was dismayed to discover that the company had regarded her trek as a publicity stunt and had no scientific interest in her findings.         Hoping to salvage something from her work, she wrote ''Witch Doctor's Apprentice.'' More adventure story than medical manual, the book, revised in 1975 and in 1990 (Citadel Press), nevertheless described a host of plants she said the Indians used to prevent tooth decay, painlessly extract teeth, dissolve kidney stones, heal burns and cure or prevent scores of other maladies.         Mrs. Maxwell returned to South America and continued her research until 1986, eventually collecting more than 350 plants used to treat more than 100 common ailments.         While her work was shunned by drug companies, Mrs. Maxwell, who made her home in Iquitos, Peru, became a heroine to a coterie of enthusiasts who would make pilgrimages to the compound where she held court to pay tribute, sometimes with unsettling results.         Once when an avid photographer of exotic birds gushingly exclaimed that she must be very familiar with the birds of South America, Mrs. Maxwell acknowledged that she was, ''mainly by taste.''         Her dream that the plants of the upper Amazon would become a multibillion-dollar cash crop and halt the destruction of the rain forest eluded her. But Mrs. Maxwell, who had been working with a Mississippi State scientist to produce a technical manual on Amazon remedies, remained confident that her work would be eventually be recognized by mainstream science.         ''As soon as I'm gone,'' she told a friend, ''they'll come running.''       
         Jeanette Nolan, who began her film career 50 years ago as Lady Macbeth opposite Orson Welles and is now being seen as the mother of the character played by Robert Redford in ''The Horse Whisperer,'' died on June 5 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Miss Nolan, who lived in Hollywood, was 86.         She had suffered a stroke a week earlier, said her daughter, Holly Wright of Charlottesville, Va., and Manhattan.         Miss Nolan's 70-year career in acting also included roles in theater, radio and television.         In the 1930's, long before Montana became a popular hideaway for show business stars, Miss Nolan and her husband, John McIntire, an actor whom she married in 1935, maintained a log cabin in the Rockies 3 miles from the Canadian border and 14 miles from the nearest mail drop. There they watched the stars through a skylight in the roof, fished for trout off the back porch, bagged an occasional bear or deer for food, trapped beavers (whose fur became a coat for Miss Nolan) and weathered temperatures of 55 below zero. She baked her own bread, churned her butter and in one year, she said, put up 500 quarts of vegetables, fruit and venison.         When the couple needed to replenish their capital -- Mr. McIntire said all you needed in Montana was a $200-a-year grubstake -- they would come to New York and star in radio programs.         On Sunday nights, for example, Mr. McIntire was the ''Crime Doctor'' on CBS, and Miss Nolan the woman he psychoanalyzed. They appeared frequently on ''Cavalcade of America,'' where Miss Nolan once played Ann Rutledge to her husband's Abe Lincoln. Fridays would find them on Philip Morris's ''Perfect Crime.''         ''I might play the murderer and Jeanette the moll,'' Mr. McIntire said. ''Or things like that.''         Miss Nolan, who could produce an Irish dialect or Spanish, Italian, German or Russian accent on demand, also appeared on CBS's ''Big Sister'' series and ''The Court of Missing Heirs.'' The busy days of rehearsals and broadcasts often lasted 15 hours.         After Miss Nolan made her film debut in 1948 opposite Welles's Macbeth, she performed in well over 20 films, including ''Words and Music'' (1948), ''No Sad Songs for Me'' (1950), ''The Big Heat'' (1953), ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962), ''The Rescuers'' (1977), ''True Confessions'' (1981) and ''Cloak and Dagger'' (1984).         On television, where she earned four Emmy nominations, Miss Nolan appeared on more than 300 programs, including ''Perry Mason,'' ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ''Richard Diamond, Private Detective,'' ''I Spy,'' ''The F.B.I.,'' ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''MacGyver.'' She also had three series of her own: ''Hotel de Paree,'' ''The Richard Boone Show'' and ''Dirty Sally,'' a spinoff of ''Gunsmoke.''         Miss Nolan, one of three children of Ada and Edward Nolan, a union official, was born in Los Angeles in 1911. Short of money as a student of theater arts at Los Angeles City College in the Depression, she took a classmate's suggestion that she audition for a radio show. Asked if she could do a Scottish dialect, she did it and three others. She was hired at once and never stopped working.         Mr. McIntire died in 1991. Their son, Tim, also an actor, died in 1986 when he was 42. Besides her daughter, Miss Nolan is survived by her sister, Miriam Walker of Ashland, Ore., and a grandson.       
         Emily Whaley, a South Carolina woman with a green thumb and such an eye for color that she helped show flowering Charleston there was bloom beyond azaleas and camellias and turned her backyard into one of the nation's most acclaimed private gardens, died on Monday at her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C. She was 87 and had become something of celebrity since the publication of a memoir, ''Mrs. Whaley and her Charleston Garden,'' last year.         Her family said the cause was a stroke.         No one would mistake Mrs. Whaley's garden for, say, Longwood Gardens, but as home gardens go, the one she maintained for more than 50 years on a 30-foot by 100-foot plot behind her narrow 1754 white clapboard house at 58 Church Street, a block from the harbor in Charleston's historic district, has been a perennial eye-popper.         Among other things it has been featured in books by Rosemary Vaerey and other garden writers and has been a fixture on the Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tours.         The garden has been considered special partly because it was laid out in 1941 by a renowned landscape architect, Loutrell Briggs, who took full advantage of a brick carriage house, a couple of mighty oaks and a magnolia tree on neighboring properties as backdrops of opportunity for a design that included five distinct gardens, or ''rooms,'' as Mrs. Whaley called them.         But mainly it was because Mrs. Whaley filled the Briggs design with repeated flair, adding a statue here, ripping out a bed of plants there and forever experimenting with new plants in varied combinations.         That was not, to be sure, because she hadn't gotten it right the first time, but because her tastes changed every few years.         Until her book, billed as ''a conversation with William Baldwin,'' a  South Carolina novelist, was published by Algonquin Books last year, Mrs. Whaley's fame had been largely local, but well established.         One of the first local gardeners to dare to plant for year-round blooms in a city whose signature azaleas and camellias lose their blossoms in the torrid Charleston summers, Mrs. Whaley helped establish a trend of planting perennials like roses, gerbera daisies and hydrangeas, in front of the towering azalea and camellia shrubs.         She was also one of the first to open her garden to the public to raise money for charities, a practice that attracted some 3,000 paying visitors a year and led some to call her garden the most visited private garden in the country.         For Mrs. Whaley, an accomplished pianist and ballroom dancer who helped start the Cotillion, a dancing school that has become a Charleston social fixture, and once taught chess, gardening came more than naturally. It was, she liked to say, in her genes.         The daughter of a country doctor, Mrs. Whaley was born Emily Kershaw in Pinopolis, a village about 40 miles west of Charleston, and spent part of her childhood at her mother's family's Belvidere Plantation, helping her mother tend a 13-acre garden even as her mother had helped her mother garden.         After attending the University of Georgia she married Ben Scott Whaley, who became a prominent Charleston lawyer, served a term in the state legislature, was United States Attorney for Charleston in the Truman Administration and played a crucial role in creating his wife's garden.         With his wife confined to bed during a difficult pregnancy in the summer of 1941, Mr. Whaley asked if there was some special present she would like. She said yes, a garden designed by Loutrell Briggs.         It took a few years for Mrs. Whaley to turn the Briggs blueprint into an actual garden, but once she got it growing, she did not neglect it.         Working for several hours a day with her longtime assistant, Junior Robinson, she was a demon for pruning, a necessity in such a small garden with narrow brick walks.         Mrs. Whaley was not sentimental about her plantings. Let a row of Italian cypresses grow too tall for her tastes and whack, they would be gone.         A woman so attuned to the subtleties of nature that she was forever commenting on the weather and could become ecstatic over the feel of a gentle breeze on the back of her neck, Mrs. Whaley, if her book can be trusted, seemed comfortable speaking in epigrams.         A secluded garden bench, for example, was ''a place to invite your soul for a visit.''         For all her love of gardening, it was hardly her only love or her only talent. She also, its seems, had a way with the stove.         In October, Algonquin is bringing out a second Whaley collaboration with Mr. Baldwin, a book of recipes and family stories, ''Mrs. Whaley Entertains.''         Mrs. Whaley, whose husband died in 1987, is survived by three daughters, Emily Whipple, Anne Le Clercq and Martha Adams, all of Charleston, and seven grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Stickney, who created the role of the mother in ''Life with Father'' and also appeared in many other Broadway hits during a career that spanned more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.         ''Life with Father,'' by Howard Lindsay (Miss Stickney's husband) and Russel Crouse, opened at the Empire Theater on Nov. 8, 1939. When it closed after seven years and 3,224 performances, it was -- and it still is today -- the longest running nonmusical show in Broadway history. The Lindsays, who were among the most celebrated acting couples in the United States, played the leading roles of Clarence and Vinnie Day for five years. Based on Clarence Day's reminiscences about his youth in New York in the 1880's, the play told the story of a large family, led by a frequently exasperated father tempered by his charming wife who put up with all his crotchets.         The play was turned down by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne and many other stars. Finally it was tried out in summer stock at the Lakewood Theater in Skowhegan, Me., with Mr. Lindsay and Miss Stickney thrust into the leading roles. As Miss Stickney said: ''We weren't at all sure we were good enough for the parts. We had never originally intended to play them ourselves.''         Success in summer stock eventually led to Broadway, and opening night was filled with minor disasters. In the first scene the actress playing the maid accidentally dropped a tray of dishes, and, later, several actors forgot their lines. As Miss Stickney remembered, she and her husband went home and cried: ''Little did we realize that the play would last through World War II.''         Mr. Lindsay attributed the phenomenal success to the fact that the play was not just a comedy but also had a tender, familial side: ''People who see 'Life with Father' are emotionally moved as well as amused. They see so much of themselves in the characters on the stage. Booth Tarkington summed it up well when he said the play is in reality 'promptings to memory.' ''         At the heart of the play -- and of its tenderness -- was Miss Stickney's performance as the wise and patient mother, Vinnie, who was understanding without being overly sentimental. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said her portrait was ''brilliant acting, both sweet and witty, with a supple response to the storminess of her domestic economy.''         The Lindsays returned to their roles in 1947 -- when the play set a record of 3,183 performances -- staying in the cast for several weeks. The following year, they played the Days again, in the sequel, ''Life with Mother,'' and that play ran for a year. When the original Empire Theater (where both plays first opened) was demolished in 1953, the couple salvaged two red plush orchestra seats and placed them in their elegant East Side town house.         Miss Stickney was born in Dickinson, N.D. Her father, Victor Hugo Stickney, a doctor who made calls on horseback, was one of the first 10 members elected to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. Stage-struck from an early age, she studied at the North Western Dramatic School in Minneapolis, sang and danced as one of the four ''Southern Belles'' in vaudeville and acted with various stock companies. When she came to New York in the 1920's, she was turned down for so many roles that she wrote a poem about the experience. The poem, called ''You're Not the Type,'' was published in Liberty magazine and was the beginning of her sideline literary career.         For two summers she was the featured ingenue in summer stock at the Lakewood Theater, then returned to New York to look for work. In New York, she met Mr. Lindsay, who was writing vaudeville sketches. When he was hired to direct the next summer at Lakewood, he was told he could choose his own company, except for the ingenue, a role reserved for the popular Miss Stickney. They were married in 1927.         After making her Broadway debut in 1926 in a small role in ''The Squall,'' she soon became known for playing eccentric characters and was in one hit after another. She was  Liz, a mad scrub woman, in ''Chicago,'' the first Broadway show directed by George Abbott. In ''The Front Page,'' she created the role of Mollie Molloy, the woman who jumps out an open courthouse window. That was followed by George Kelly's ''Philip Goes Forth,'' Rose Franken's ''Another Language'' (her first important role), Paul Osborn's ''On Borrowed Time'' and many other plays. She was a character actress who had become a star.         At the same time, as playwright and director, her husband was himself enjoying halcyon days. He and Mr. Crouse had collaborated on the book for ''Anything Goes'' and other musicals, before they began writing their adaptation of the Clarence Day stories.         After ''Life with Father,'' Miss Stickney was in, among other plays, ''The Small Hours,'' ''To Be Continued,'' ''Kind Sir'' and ''The Honeys.'' Her films included ''The Little Minister'' and ''I Never Sang for My Father.'' On television she played a bootlegger in the first episode of ''The Waltons.''         As an admirer of Edna St. Vincent Millay, she wrote ''A Lovely Light,'' a one-woman play based on Millay's poetry and letters. As with ''Life with Father,'' she tried it out in summer stock before bringing it to Broadway in 1960, in a production directed by her husband. The actress toured the show at colleges and universities and later brought it back to Broadway. In 1967, she did a revival of ''Life with Father'' at City Center, with Leon Ames as co-star.         Her husband died in 1968. No immediate family members survive.         In 1973, Miss Stickney returned to the stage and made her Broadway musical debut in ''Pippin,'' taking over the role of Berthe after the death of Irene Ryan. She sang one song, ''No Time at All.'' Previously, she had been in several musicals on television. She and her husband played the king and queen in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' in 1957, and in 1968 she appeared in Stephen Sondheim's ''Evening Primrose.''         In her 1979 memoir, ''Openings and Closings,'' Miss Stickney, who seemed to be the most quietly confident actress onstage, wrote about her lifelong battle with stage fright. She said she had learned one lesson: ''When panic overtook me and I felt absolutely unable to go on, I would tell myself, 'You don't have to do the whole play -- you don't even have to play the next scene -- all you have to do is say the next line.' '' Although she never fully conquered that fear, she was always able to say the next line and the next line, and in so doing found a lifetime of accomplishment in the theater.       
         Erika Cheetham, an English medieval scholar who made a fortune translating the predictions of the 16th-century physician and astrologer Nostradamus, who gazed not only at the stars but also, legend had it, into a brass bowl of water to see visions of the future, died on May 3 in London. She was 58.         Her books, ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' ''The Further Prophecies of Nostradamus'' and ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus,'' in which she claimed to have found predictions of the execution of  Charles I, the Great Fire of London, the Apollo 13 catastrophe and the spread of AIDS, sold in the millions.         They were on mass-market paperback best-seller lists for years in the United States, Britain and other countries, and, since the first book appeared in 1973, they have never been out of print.         Her good fortune came about because of a mistake at the Taylorian Library at Oxford, where she was working toward a doctorate in medieval languages. The librarian gave her the wrong book, the ''Propheties de M. Nostradamus.'' She found it fascinating and saw in it what she interpreted to be a prediction of World War II.         Michel de Notredame, the astrologer's real name, was also a traveling doctor from Provence, doing what was regarded as heroic work during plagues in Aix-en-Provence and Lyons. He produced several almanacs and a book of rhymed prophecies called ''Centuries,'' which has stayed in print through 300 editions. Before  his death in 1566, he had gained a wide following.         In the 33d quatrain of his fifth set of predictions, for example, a passage on the city of Nantes read: ''The city's leaders in revolt, will in the name of liberty, slaughter its inhabitants without regard to age or sex. There will be screams and howls and piteous sights.'' Two centuries later this was interpreted as a prophecy of the drownings of Nantes under the Committee of Public Safety in 1793.         But being a closet Lutheran in a time of the Inquisitions held to punish heretics, most of Nostradamus's prophesies were cryptic and written in a mix of archaic French, Latin, Greek, Italian or English. Translators contended that the quatrains contained codes, anagrams, hints and fragments of meaning that, put together, were predictions of coming events. A reference to a figure named Hister was taken as code for Hitler.         Erika McMahon-Turner was born in London on July 7, 1939, a daughter of wealthy parents, Eric A. Turner, Under Secretary to the Admiralty, and Helen Lilian McMahon Turner.  She attended a convent school but was expelled for writing an essay contending that God did not exist. She had an interest even then in the paranormal and the prophetic. Later, on gaining acceptance to St. Anne's College, Oxford, she cut a stylish, aristocratic figure, someone who went riding with the Aga Khan and married a Grenadier Guard, James Nicholas Milne Cheetham.         After receiving her Ph.D. she became a staff writer for The London Daily Mail. She wrote an article on Nostradamus in 1961 and two years later began translating his work in earnest.         Her first book appeared in 1965 and became an immediate hit, as did the other two. Her publishers at Corgi Books were now excited about Nostradamus as well. ''A very profitable business to be in,'' one was quoted as saying. ''Every publisher should have a Nostradamus title on their lists. And the beauty of it is that if you get one of Nostradamus's predictions wrong, you can always remove it from the next edition.''         Indeed, at the start of the 1990's at least 10 Nostradamus titles were in print, and with the advent of the Persian Gulf war, bookstores in Britain and the United States were selling out, with total sales tripling in some cases.         Ms. Cheetham, however, was ambivalent about the perspicacity of her hero. Claiming to be a linguist, a scholar and a skeptic, she once said: ''It's all rubbish, you know. Some of it is so vague and tortured and you could bend all sorts of events to fit.''         At other times she projected conviction: ''It's a question of all the portents coming together,'' she said in 1985, ''a pope with two attempts on his life, two brothers assassinated in the U.S.A. and the advent of Halley's comet.''         In her periods of skepticism, she was not alone. ''In a respectable London bookshop last week,'' wrote Francis Wheen in The Guardian in 1996, ''I was astonished to find an entire section given over to works by or about Nostradamus, the mumbo-jumbo merchant.'' The likely explanation, he said, was superstition linked to the approach of the year 2000.         Other nonbelievers in the more distant past included the Catholic Church, which in 1781 put ''Centuries'' on its index of condemned books.         Ms. Cheetham also wrote the screenplay of the 1982 film ''The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' in which Orson Welles played Nostradamus, and she was a contributor to periodicals and encyclopedias.         She was divorced in 1980, and is survived by a son, Alexander M. Cheetham.       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Elizabeth Karlin, a Wisconsin doctor, advocate of women's rights and head of a clinic in Madison that was a target of abortion foes, died on July 27 at her home in nearby Arena. She was 54.         The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed a few months ago, her family said.         A native New Yorker, Dr. Karlin graduated from Bronx High School of Science and Antioch College. She received her medical degree at the University of Wisconsin and became an internist specializing in endocrinology.         She worked as a general practitioner in Tanzania before settling in Madison with a practice in internal medicine. She began to provide abortions in the 1980's even as more and more doctors refused to do so because of the actions of opponents.         Until her illness was diagnosed, she directed the Women's Medical Center on Madison's West Side. She was an outspoken champion of women's rights to self-determination.         ''I provide a full range of women's medical care and counseling to women who largely have no other access to health care,'' she wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1995, ''yet I am forced to wear a bulletproof vest, to outwit my harassers and to hire security to protect my clinic and staff. My job is to offer nurturing medical care to the women who least expect kindness, excellence or even cleanliness.''         Such caring and respect, she concluded, would actually serve to decrease the number of abortions in the country in the long run.         Dr. Karlin is survived by her daughter, Jessica Feierman of Philadelphia; a son, Joshua Feierman of New York City; and her mother, Rosa Karlin of Madison. Her marriage to Steven Feierman of Philadelphia ended in divorce.       
         They were the Thelma and Louise of Nazi Poland, and if Hollywood hasn't tumbled to their story, it may be because Blanca Rosenberg and Maria Rosenbloom had too many hair-raising escapes, too many improbable rescues -- and far too much unremitting horror in between -- for a single script to handle.         Then again, for all the appeal of the wily and intrepid heroines -- the blond, blue-eyed Bronislava, as Mrs. Rosenberg was known, and her brunet sidekick, Maria -- Mrs. Rosenberg's 1993 memoir, which described in rollicking and harrowing detail how the two young women survived the Holocaust while posing as Catholic peasants, left the story unfinished.         While it continues for Dr. Rosenbloom, a retired professor at the Hunter School of Social Work who lives in Manhattan, the story has now ended for Mrs. Rosenberg, and with satisfying flair.         Her death on Sept. 11 at her apartment in Manhattan -- at the age of 85, in her own bed, after a long, peaceful retirement and a distinguished career as an assistant professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work -- was a triumphant flick of her hand, almost six decades coming, to the German soldiers who had arrived in the small city of Kolomyja in eastern Poland (now Ukraine) on July 3, 1941, and tacked up posters that declared in three languages, ''Death to All Jews.''         As Mrs. Rosenberg made clear in her book, ''To Tell at Last'' (University of Illinois Press), it did not take too many aktions in the increasingly depopulated Kolomyja ghetto for it to become apparent that the Nazi regime intended to kill each and every Jew in Poland -- including those, like Mrs. Rosenberg and Dr. Rosenbloom, who had documents identifying them as essential workers at a clothing factory.         At the time of the German invasion, Mrs. Rosenberg, a native of Gorlice who had studied law at the University of Cracow, was the 27-year-old wife of a doctor who had escaped the Nazis by accepting a medical assignment with the retreating Soviet Army, leaving her behind with an infant son, Zygmund, and her adored younger brother, Romek.         Mrs. Rosenberg's son, siblings, parents and other relatives died in the Holocaust, but her husband survived. The couple were divorced after the war, and she promptly married an old flame, Sam Rosenberg, a gynecologist who became a psychiatrist in New York. Dr. Rosenberg died in 1982.         After watching her brother virtually volunteer for death during a mass ''selection,'' Mrs. Rosenberg escaped to the nearby city of Lwow armed with a birth certificate, supplied by her compassionate factory manager, belonging to a Polish Catholic woman who had died.         If she had kept to herself, Mrs. Rosenberg might have had a safer time of it. But she was continually befriending those, like Dr. Rosenbloom, whose appearance increased the likelihood that they would be unmasked.         As a ground-zero account of life on the run, Mrs. Rosenberg's book is filled with crosscuts between cities and a dizzying array of hurried apartment changes, narrow escapes and ruthless shakedowns by police officers, greedy landlords and freelance extortionists.         In one scene, for example, the young women escape through a back window of a military hospital in Lwow, where they had been working, as the police are coming in the front door (they had been betrayed by one of Dr. Rosenbloom's former college classmates who had spotted her in a bookshop). This is swiftly followed by a scene in which they make their way in disguise past wanted posters with their pictures (from their hospital identifications) at the Lwow train station, which is in turn followed by their arrival in Warsaw -- in the midst of the abortive ghetto uprising of April 1943 -- and their immediate arrest on suspicion of being Jews.         The two women spent the last months of the war working for German families in Heidelberg.         Mrs. Rosenberg said that she originally wrote her book in 1948 as a way to deal with the paralyzing guilt she felt as a Holocaust survivor, and that she published it to satisfy her brother Romek's last request that she stay alive to tell the story of the Kolomyja ghetto to the world.         She is survived by twin sons, Alex of Athens, Ga., and Mark of Coimbatore, India, and two grandchildren.       
         Toni House, an author and a longtime Washington journalist who spent the last 16 years as the Supreme Court's public information officer, died here today of lung cancer, the Court announced. She was 55.         A former president of the Washington Press Club and officer of other press organizations, Ms. House was a Washington institution even before Chief Justice Warren E. Burger hired her for the anomalous position of press officer for an institution that often appeared to have an aversion to press coverage.         As a reporter and editor for The Washington Star for 15 years, Ms. House had won visibility and success covering the District of Columbia Police Department and local courts, one of the few women at the time to work that beat. With a co-author, Chuck Conconi, she wrote ''The Washington Sting,'' a book about an undercover police fencing operation she had covered in the early 1970's. She was deputy picture editor of The Star when the newspaper ceased publication in 1981.         As the Supreme Court's public information officer, Ms. House was the Court's public voice, although not, as she often stressed, its interpreter. ''From the city that brought you the word 'spinmeister,' I am not one,'' she told the Atlanta Lawyers Club in a speech several years ago, adding, ''I mean, if you don't like a Supreme Court decision, who are you going to appeal to?''         For the last several years, she served on the board of the American Judicature Society, a public interest group that strives to increase public understanding of legal issues.         Antoinette Aiello House -- she used the name Toni all her life -- was born on Jan. 5, 1943, in Washington, where her father was a doctor. She graduated from American University here and lived in Arlington, Va., with her husband, William J. Weller, whom she married in 1990. Besides Mr. Weller, she is survived by a daughter from an earlier marriage, Valerie Reuther of Seattle, and a brother, Dr. Homer House of Sherwood, Md.       
         Joan Hickson, a stage, screen and television actress who became an international celebrity when she played Miss Marple, Agatha Christie's sharp-witted elderly detective, in a BBC television series from 1984 to 1992, died over the weekend at a hospital in Colchester, Essex, said her son, Nicholas Butler. She was 92.         Though Miss Hickson acted in more than 80 movies and had a considerable stage career, it was as Miss Marple, a role she took on in her late 70's, that she achieved her most success and her greatest renown. On ''Mystery!,'' she played the part just as Christie had written it: as a seemingly fluffy and disorganized spinster whose vast understanding of human nature and formidable, cleareyed intelligence helped her solve the mysteries that visited her village with uncanny regularity.         Miss Hickson took to her late television career with relish, saying she thought that Miss Marple was a ''splendid'' person because there was ''nothing you could say or do that would shock her.'' Among her legions of fans, drawn from the more than 30 countries in which the series appeared, was Queen Elizabeth, who awarded Miss Hickson the Order of the British Empire in 1987.         Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, in 1906, Joan Hickson began acting as soon as she could despite disapproval from her relatives. ''My Aunt Aggie -- she was about four feet tall -- drew herself up to her full height and said, 'What is Joan's destination to be?,' which she thought was the gutter, you see,'' she once recalled in an interview. Her first appearance, in 1927, was in a provincial theater company as an aristocrat.         Later, she appeared often in West End comedies, often taking on the role of a slightly batty aunt or a befuddled middle-aged woman, characters with names like Mrs. Pottle, Gladys Rumbelow and Mrs. Mould. During World War II, when London was prone to sudden bombing, she appeared in the Open Air Theater in Regent's Park.         ''We kept one eye on the sky to see what was coming over,'' she recalled. ''We used to feel the audience were being damned stupid because they sort of hurled themselves on the ground.''         After a long stage career, which included appearances in Henry James's ''The Tragic Muse'' and Ian Hay's ''The Gusher,'' she began to appear more and more often in movies, including ''The Guinea Pig'' (1948), ''The Card'' (1952) and ''The  39 Steps'' (1959).         Speaking of the scores of films she made, she once said: ''I watch these old films in black and white, and suddenly the door opens and there I am. The other day I was wearing the most awful hat.''         She returned often to the stage. Later in her career, she appeared in three of Peter Nichols's plays: ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg'' (1967), ''The Freeway'' and ''Forget-Me-Not Lane'' (1967). She also played Mrs. Bradman in the National Theater Company's production of Sir Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' (1976) and won a Tony Award as best supporting actress for her performance as Delia in Alan Ayckbourn's ''Bedroom Farce'' (1977).         Before she became television's definitive Miss Marple (''there were 30 others in the queue for auditions,'' she said), she appeared in the slender role of Miss Pryce in a 1946 West End production of Christie's ''Appointment With Death.'' Christie  happened to sit in the audience one night, and sent Miss Hickson a prophetic note afterward that read, ''I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple.''         ''Retirement is fatal,'' Miss Hickson once said, and she continued working long after the Miss Marple series ended, recording audio books of Christie mysteries. Her husband, Eric Butler, a family doctor, died in 1967. She is survived by a son and a daughter.       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Winnie Ruth Judd, who spent three decades in an Arizona state mental hospital as the notorious ''trunk murderess'' in one of the most sensational criminal cases of the 1930's, died in Phoenix on Friday. She was 93.         With the Great Depression at full strength in the fall of 1931 and newspapers vying for stories to take their readers' minds off their miseries, the lurid details of the Judd case proved irresistible. But the case also provoked a debate over capital punishment.         Mrs. Judd, then a 26-year-old secretary at a Phoenix medical clinic and the wife of a doctor, arrived at Union Station in Los Angeles on Oct. 18, 1931, on a train from Phoenix, accompanied by two trunks and several valises. When a baggage man noticed what appeared to be blood dripping from one trunk, he asked her to open it. Mrs. Judd said she did not have the key and left in an automobile driven by her brother, Burton McKinnell. The police were called and traced the car from the license plate.         Inside the larger trunk, detectives found the body of Agnes Anne LeRoi, 32. What they found in the smaller trunk catapulted the case into headline news around the country. It contained remains of Hedvig Samuelson, 24, her body neatly cut into three pieces to make it easier to pack. A few days later, a valise left behind by Mrs. Judd was found to contain a fourth body section.         The two women had been fatally shot the previous Friday night at a Phoenix residence they had previously shared with Mrs. Judd when her husband was out of town.         Four days after the bodies were discovered, Mrs. Judd was arrested in Los Angeles. She quickly became an object of curiosity. When she was returned to Phoenix for trial, thousands lined the streets for a glimpse, and the owner of the home where the murders occurred sold 10-cent tickets for tours.         Mrs. Judd maintained that she shot the women in self-defense when they attacked her during an argument, but prosecutors said that she entered the residence while the two  slept, then shot them in the head out of jealousy over attentions paid to them by her married boyfriend.         Two years later, by then dubbed the ''trunk murderess'' and the ''tiger woman'' in headlines, Mrs. Judd was convicted of murdering Miss LeRoi and was sentenced to hang. Mrs. Judd was not tried for the murder of Miss Samuelson, so the question of who dismembered her body was never formally raised. There was later speculation that a local physician other than husband had performed the expert cutting.         Pressure was brought to spare Mrs. Judd's life in view of her claims of self-defense and her lawyer's assertions that she was mentally ill. Thirty state legislators and a group of 34 ministers and priests signed petitions, and Arizona authorities received several thousand letters on her behalf. Eleanor Roosevelt was among those expressing concern.         Several days before the hanging was to take place, a jury impaneled for a sanity hearing found that Mrs. Judd was then insane, and she was institutionalized. She escaped six times from the Arizona State Hospital for the Insane in Phoenix over the next two decades, maintaining later that a nurse had given her a key to the entrance that she hid in a coin holder and used in some escapes. She was taken back into custody within a short time on each occasion and otherwise proved a model patient, cooking for other patients and helping bathe them.         On Oct. 8, 1962, Mrs. Judd escaped yet again, this time disappearing for almost seven years. She was finally found in the San Francisco area, where, calling herself Marian Lane, she had worked as a housekeeper in a mansion owned by an elderly woman. The noted defense lawyer Melvin Belli took her case and fought unsuccessfully against extradition to Arizona.         Mrs. Judd was judged to be sane by medical examiners in Arizona, was transferred to the state penitentiary in Florence and was freed shortly before Christmas 1971. She returned to California to work for the family that had previously employed her, later lived in Stockton and then went back to Phoenix a few years before her death.         Sixty-seven years after the murders, the crime lives on. An Internet ''sightseeing tour'' of Phoenix has a photo of the site where the murders occurred (it is now a vacant lot between two homes) and advises that an apartment building where Mrs. Judd once lived is the site of a medical center.         A longtime friend, Kenneth Cain of Sun City, Ariz., said yesterday that Mrs. Judd had no immediate survivors.         In a letter she wrote in 1952, Mrs. Judd, an Indiana native and the daughter of a minister, called the dismemberment ''a ghastly deed'' but again maintained that she shot the two women in self-defense. She said that she transported the bodies because she was suffering from shock, but wrote, 'I've asked God many times to forgive me.''       
         Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers.         O.K., it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930's and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son.         Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor before the 1980's, or ever on stage.         Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight sensations.         For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920's.         Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana.         Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her.         It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire.         Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ''until a millionaire comes along, as he put it.''         A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at her skill, she began to get the notion that she might actually become a professional.         She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.         Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and, well, she was such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.         During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she persuaded Mr. Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on. ''The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ''and I didn't like doing it with a partner.''         The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.         It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu recording of ''El Manisero'' (''The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930's.         After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Mr. Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.         It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother tagging along). ''He got it,'' she said. ''He was very good.''         When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, as she recalled, ''Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.''         For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting ''Vive La France.''         Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day,  she was hailed by critics as ''the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ''Mariana scarfs,'' copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.         After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ''that lovely Havana torso flipper.'' Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba was over.         After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway).         When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as a typist.         Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.       
         Mary Main, a novelist who also wrote a highly regarded biography of Eva Peron, died on Nov. 8 at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She was 95.         Ms. Main was born to British parents in Buenos Aires, where her father was general manager of the Buenos Aires Western Railway.         She grew up in privileged Anglo-Argentine society, attending finishing school in England before returning to her home, where she married James Main, a British engineer, in 1927.         In 1941, the couple moved to the United States and Ms. Main began writing short stories for The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and other magazines. She published two novels in the late 1940's, and in 1950 Doubleday asked her to write a biography of Eva Peron, who with her husband, Juan, was at the peak of power in Argentina.         Fearing trouble from the Peronistas, Ms. Main researched the book clandestinely in Argentina and published it under the pseudonym Maria Flores. ''Evita: The Woman With the Whip'' appeared in 1952, shortly after Eva Peron's death.         After Juan Peron was thrown out of power, subsequent editions appeared under Ms. Main's real name.         The success of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ''Evita'' in the 1970's and the appearance of the movie version in 1996 revived interest in Ms. Main's book, and it was republished several times in the United States and Britain.         ''I felt compassion, not sympathy,'' Ms. Main said in a 1980 interview in The New York Times. ''Eva did evil things, but she wasn't really evil. She lived a life of fantasy. She was her own creation.''         As Maria Flores, Ms. Main wrote two other books based on events in Latin American dictatorships: the novel ''The Call From Calle Moreno,'' about a doctor called in to treat a victim of Juan Peron's police, and ''The Benefactor,'' a story inspired by the disappearance of the Columbia University professor Jesus de Galindez, who was widely assumed to have been kidnapped by agents of Rafael Trujillo, the Dominican dictator.         Ms. Main's eyesight began to fail slowly in the 1940's, but it was many years before she could accept that she was going blind.         She was totally blind by the early 1960's, but she continued to write, dictating her works on tape and editing by going back and forth from one tape to another. But she published only one more book, ''The Girl Who Was Never Queen,'' a historical novel, in 1962.         In 1973, she moved to Connecticut to live with her son, Jeremy. She joined the National Federation of the Blind, founding its Stamford-area chapter and serving as its president.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three grandchildren, two stepgrandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Paula Kissinger, a refugee from Nazi Germany who held the Bible at the White House in 1973 when her first-born son, Henry, was sworn in as Secretary of State, the highest Cabinet post in her adopted land, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday in Manhattan. She was 97.         From the time she arrived in America in 1940 with her husband and two young sons until the time she died, Mrs. Kissinger lived in the same apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where  she was well known and well regarded by the once large German-Jewish  emigre community there.         It was Mrs. Kissinger -- the practical one in the family -- who decided that they had to leave Germany when Hitler came to power. Dr. Henry Kissinger told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that his father was reluctant to recognize the growing evil around him. ''My father was lucky he had an earthy wife who made all the decisions,'' he said.  ''She looked after necessities.''         She got in touch with a cousin in New York, and it was soon arranged.  ''It was my decision, and I did it because of the children,'' she told Mr. Isaacson. ''I knew there was not a life to be made for them if we stayed.''         Mrs. Kissinger was born Paula Stern in 1901 into a prosperous middle-class family in Leutershausen. In 1922, she married Louis Kissinger.  He was 35; she was 21. They moved to Furth, where he was a teacher, and within the year their first son, Heinz Alfred, was born. He took the name Henry when the family came to the United States. The next year a second son, Walter Bernhard, arrived. Both sons, as well as six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, survive Mrs. Kissinger.         When she arrived in New York she quickly mastered the language and, to supplement the money earned by her husband and her sons, she became a cook and a caterer in Washington Heights. She refused to leave the neighborhood, even after her husband died 10 years ago and her elder son asked her to move in with him and his wife downtown.         Several years ago, she fell in her kitchen and was unconscious for several hours. She was put on a life-support system, but when doctors wanted to remove it, her son Henry refused. When the doctors explained that she wouldn't be able to think or speak, he replied, ''You don't know my mother.'' After being unconscious for days, she awoke and asked him, ''What day is it?'' When he told her it was Tuesday, she said, ''Cancel my 10 o'clock dentist appointment.''         She returned to Germany a few times, once when Dr. Kissinger was given an honorary degree. She was struck by the unreality of it all.  ''First you get chased away, and then you get treated like royalty,'' she told a reporter. Back home, when her son came to visit, the neighborhood was all excited and she admitted to being proud: ''They say, 'My son the doctor.' What should I say, my son the Aussenminister?' ''       
         Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career to become a successful publicist, then an even more successful manager of concert artists and finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City Center and other stages, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home, across the street from City Center. She was 96.         Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and entertained audiences there from the 1940's through the 60's.         Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer, Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser, Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.         The productions were quite polished. Indeed, after an opening of one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple received a floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, ''We wish last night had been the Broadway opening.''         In her day, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female producers; the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene Selznick. She was as tough as they were, a woman in perpetual motion, but she did not seem that way.         ''Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said Robert Whitehead, the producer. ''She had a great determination to get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She was an extraordinary person.''         Franchot Tone, an actor whose work Miss Dalrymple always admired, thought of her as ''the tenderest little lady.'' But a writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer described as her as ''as fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense of timing like a Garand rifle.''         In addition to luring actors, she was also able to persuade producers to give the City Center sets and costumes when their plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her revival of ''My Fair Lady'' featured the original costumes.         Creating a 'Temple' For Performing Arts         City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard, was established on West 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to be a ''temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a top price of $2.         Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning. Her success with their dream was such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and called itself ''a glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens of extraordinary musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought the phrase an understatement of what Miss Dalrymple had accomplished.         Initially serving as volunteer director of public relations and as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple remained at the middle of City Center's publicity apparatus even after she started producing and directing. At the same time, she served as personal manager to performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, Mary Martin, Jose Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily Pons.         Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J., to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War, had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family very well.         When she was 9, she finished a short story, ''The Spinning Top,'' and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this success, she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving $5 for each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as secondary to her goal of becoming a stage director.         After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved to New York, studied secretarial skills at a business school and got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when she was only 16. She even made a respectable sum in the market before the crash of 1929. The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and into vaudeville. She created an act with her beau Dan Jarrett and worked with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit.         During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ''Salt Water,'' written with Mr. Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was hired by Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent, and her skill in handling the press so impressed him that he encouraged her to work at it full time.         It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the drama critic for The New York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. It was not a successful union, but in the five years they were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ''It Happened in New York,'' which was made into a movie by Universal Pictures.         Miss Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder, who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral will be held on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. at the West Point chapel.         Miss Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American Theater Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939 she was its first publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained speakers who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door Canteen.         By 1940, Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press agent, much sought after because of her contacts. Among the Broadway plays for which she handled the publicity were ''Mr. and Mrs. North'' (1941), ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943)  and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1944).         In 1945, she turned to producing. Her first effort, a collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ''Hope for the Best,'' a comedy by William McCleery, who had been Sunday editor of the newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity business but pursued more producing ventures, among them ''Brighten the Corner'' (1945) and ''Burlesque'' (1946).         Meanwhile, she began to devote more of her energy to developing productions for the newly formed City Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over by the city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for its occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations.         Early productions included Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' mostly because it required no scenery and was inexpensive to produce, and ''Porgy and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was completing a national tour.         Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of ''Porgy.'' ''I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its original form and present it exactly as as George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she once recalled.         One Misstep, Angering Sartre         In her 1975 memoir, ''From the Last Row,'' she recalled that Howard Taubman of The New York Times ''loved it'' but that Judith Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the original Broadway version. ''I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said, ''and told her she had a tin ear.'' She was pleased that this production of ''Porgy'' sold out and that ''Miss Crist never held my impulsive letter against me.''         In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when she succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce his play ''Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel Taradash called ''Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing Charles Boyer to make it his first Broadway role.         What began as a coup threatened to become a coup de grace; Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after he gave Miss Dalrymple the go-ahead and was filled with loathing for it. He loudly denounced it publicly as ''a vulgar, common melodrama with an anti-Communist bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson echoed Sartre's denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that it was a production that ''looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly closed.         But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word of her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State Department asked her to arrange for what the United States would offer at the Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958 the State Department called on her again, this time to arrange for the performances sent by the United States to the Brussels World's Fair, including those by Harry Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose Iturbi and the Juilliard String Quartet.         In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Richard III'' and ''Charley's Aunt.'' To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Mr. Ferrer and all the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity minimum.         Mr. Ferrer called the center ''this happy beehive of the arts,'' and donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and box-office success. ''They have made the theater seem like a fresh, exciting, varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times.         In 1956 Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in ''King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Both productions earned critical praise.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the villain), ''Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse in the title role), ''Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ''The Pajama Game.''         When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 1960's, however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal crises.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography, ''September Child'' (1963), ''Careers and Opportunities in the Theater'' (1969), ''Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook'' (1971) and ''The Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973).         As a producer, Miss Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit handling of the press, which is critical in the success of even the most expertly produced play. ''I never went in for theme parties or the crazy events that publicists stage today,'' she said in 1993. ''I simply advertised the facts of the production. At City Center, that was always enough.''
