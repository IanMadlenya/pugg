         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Valentina S. Grizodubova, a World War II air commander and pioneer aviator who was known as the Soviet Union's Amelia Earhart, died on Wednesday in Russia. She was 83.         Itar-Tass news agency attributed her death to complications of a stomach ulcer.         In 1938, Colonel Grizodubova and two other women flew nearly 4,000 miles nonstop from Moscow to the Soviet east coast near Japan in their plane, the Motherland.         After radio communication failed, their fate was unknown for several days. Running out of fuel, the plane made a forced landing in a swamp. The navigator bailed out beforehand. The crew withstood three days of rain, chased off bears and contended with a lynx in the cockpit. A Hero's Welcome         Finally rescuers found the crew, and they returned to a hero's welcome in Moscow, hailed as "daughters of the people."         The flight set a distance record for women. Miss Earhart's 1932 solo flight from Newfoundland to Ireland was a third shorter. Flying in light sport planes, Colonel Grizodubova, set other records for altitude, speed and distance for women.         Awarded the Order of Lenin and decorated as a Hero of the Soviet Union, she became a Supreme Soviet deputy and was named head of women's aviation.         In World War II, she commanded an air regiment of long-range planes, flew bombing missions and survived attacks by German fighters.         "In my experience, girls make just as good pilots as men," she said in 1942. "You cannot judge by appearance. I know girls so quiet and apparently timid that they blush when spoken to, yet they pilot bombers over Germany without qualm. No country at war today can afford to ignore the tremendous reservoir of woman power."         She married an army pilot captain, Viktor Sokoloff, and they had a son, Valerik.       
         Maria Tolstoy, a professor of Russian language and a granddaughter of the novelist Leo Tolstoy, died on Monday at home in Manhattan. She was 85.         She had a brief illness, said Cynthia Whittaker, a friend.         Ms. Tolstoy fled her native Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, resettled in Czechoslovakia, then left there in 1939 to escape the Nazis and World War II.         Arriving by ship in America in 1940, she said, "I believe, with my grandfather, that every person, every country, has a right to freedom." She helped Soviet and German emigres publish political material, worked on foreign broadcasts of Radio Liberty and assisted the United States Army.         Ms. Tolstoy, whose mother was Irish, was fluent in both English and Russian. Her parents met when her father visited Ireland to buy race horses. Active in Politics         She taught Russian at Cornell, Columbia and Indiana Universities, at the University of Michigan and at Hunter College. She retired from Hunter in 1980 but continued tutoring students the rest of her life.         Ms. Tolstoy was active in American politics as a Republican but also supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and was state co-chairwoman of Republicans for Cuomo.         She was also known for her published Russian poetry on the solitude of the emigre. With the recent fall of Communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, she expressed interest in a return visit to her native country but was too frail to make the trip.         Ms. Tolstoy left the Soviet Union in 1925 at the age of 17. She completed her studies for a doctorate in Slavic linguistics at Charles University in Prague, but the Nazis shut down the school before it granted the degree.         Her marriage to Vladimir Mansvetov ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Tatiana Benetkova of Prague, and two grandchildren.       
         Gusti Huber, a leading Viennese actress before World War II who continued her successful stage and film career in this country, died on Monday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 78.         The family said the cause was heart failure.         Ms. Huber made her American debut in 1952 in "Flight Into Egypt," the story of an Austrian refugee family struggling to get to America, directed by Elia Kazan. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Ms. Huber "brings a grave, sensitive beauty to the character and describes with rare perception the excitement and the pain of a woman whose responsibilities are beyond human strength." Portrayed Anne Frank's Mother         She is best known in this country for her portrayal of Edith Frank in the Broadway production of "The Diary of Anne Frank," which won the Pulitzer Prize and Critics Circle Award in 1956. "Gusti Huber gives a superbly controlled performance as the patient mother who is close to hysteria," wrote Mr. Atkinson.         Ms. Huber also won praise for her performance in George Stevens's 1959 film version of the Anne Frank story.  After retiring from acting in 1961, she lectured in New York area high schools on the legacy of Anne Frank, the Jewish girl who hid from the Nazis in a garret in Amsterdam and who died in a concentration camp shortly before the end of World War II..         While still a student at the Academy for Music and Representative Art in Vienna, Ms. Huber began her acting career in 1929 at the Deutsches Volkstheatre. Joining the Schauspielhaus in Zurich, she played more than 180 roles in a five-year period.         After the liberation of Austria in World War II, she joined a company entertaining American troops. She met and married Joseph Besch, a United States Army captain and former newspaperman.         She is survived by her husband of 47 years; three daughters, Christiana MacDonald of Paris, and Bibi Besch and Drea B. Gillogly, both of Los Angeles; a son, Andrew F. Besch of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
         Alice Wicks Olson, who received an apology from President Gerald R. Ford years after her husband committed suicide following a secret Government drug experiment, died last Thursday in Frederick, Md. She was 77.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Nils Olson, a son.         Mrs. Olson's husband, Dr. Frank R. Olson, died in 1953 when he jumped from a 10th-floor window of the old Hotel Statler in New York. After a 20-year campaign by Mrs. Olson, Federal investigators started an inquiry into the circumstances of Dr. Olson's death.         That inquiry forced the Central Intelligence Agency to acknowledge in 1975 that her husband, a civilian chemist for the Army, had been an unwitting participant in an experiment in which people were given varying doses of LSD to observe their reactions.         In addition to apologies from President Ford and the Director of Central Intelligence, the family was awarded $750,000 by Congress.         After the death of her husband, Mrs. Olson counseled alcoholics and drug addicts in Frederick. The Alice Olson House, a center for women recovering from drug and alcohol addition, was named in her honor.         In addition to Dr. Nils Olson of Frederick, she is survived by another son, Eric W. Olson of Stockholm, and three grandchildren.       
         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Terry Morris, a magazine and short-story writer and past president of the American Society of Journalists and Authors, died yesterday at her home on Central Park South in Manhattan. She was 79.         Mrs. Morris's career spanned three decades -- from 1945 to 1975 -- when she wrote dozens of articles for many of the country's leading magazines. In 1967 McCall's published an exclusive interview that she had with Stalin's daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, who had immigrated to the United States after burying her fiance's ashes in India.         She also wrote several books, including a novel, "No Hiding Place," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1942), which told of Army wives in World War II, and "Prose by Professionals: The Inside Story of the Magazine Article Writer's Craft" (Doubleday, 1961), of which she was co-editor.         She was born in New York City in 1914 and received a B.A. and an M.A. from Hunter College before teaching in the city's public high schools.         She is survived by her husband, Eugene J. Morris, and their son, Richard.       
         Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A Boston resident, she was 78.         She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman & Sons funeral homes in Boston.         A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus. For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979. Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.         Born on a farm near Winchester, Va., she became fascinated with fungi that form in garden soil and get into the blood, brain and lungs of humans, where the fungi grow and cause trouble. She told an interviewer after the 1979 award that the fungi "are molds like the ones that grow on bread in the fridge or on damp shoes in the closet."         She trained at Ohio State University, American University, George Washington University and Duke University as well as on the job as a microbiologist. In 1948, she became chief of medical mycology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington.         She left in 1962 to become an associate professor of medical mycology at Harvard University's School of Public Health and advanced to full professor in 1970. Three years later she accepted an appointment as professor of medical sciences at Southern Illinois University and also served as department chairwoman from 1974 until her academic retirement in 1977.         She then worked on foreign-student exchanges for the American Society of Microbiology in what was then the Soviet Union for three years. More recently, she worked as a volunteer at Brigham & Women's Hospital and with battered women in the Boston area.         Professor Campbell is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Flint of Daytona Beach, Fla.
