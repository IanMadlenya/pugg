        Therese Thau Heyman, a curator of photographs, graphic art and drawings and an expert on American photographic history, died Friday in Berkeley, Calif. She was 74.
She was a young curator at the East London Museum when, on Dec. 22, 1938, she spotted the coelacanth in a pile of fish on a vessel at the town's dock.
She was educated at a convent school and intended to train as a nurse, but became curator at the East London Museum in 1931, a position she held until 1973.
