         Sally Michel Avery, an artist, illustrator and widow of the painter Milton Avery, died on Jan. 9. She was 100 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Avery was born in Brooklyn in 1902 and studied painting at the Art Students League. She met her husband in Gloucester, Mass., in 1924 when he was 39 and living in Hartford. He moved to New York to be with her, and they married in 1926.         For the next few decades Mrs. Avery worked as a freelance illustrator, enabling her husband to paint full time, attend the Art Students League and find his mature style. During the 1940's and 50's, she worked as an illustrator for You and Your Child, which was then a column in The New York Times Magazine. The couple often worked side by side in the living room of their top-floor apartment at 294 West 11th Street and shared painting fellowships to Yaddo in 1956 and the MacDowell Colony in 1957. Mr. Avery died in 1960, at 75.         Mrs. Avery, who always exhibited as Sally Michel, had her only solo show in New York at the Waverly Gallery in 1981. Solo retrospectives of her paintings were held in 1987 at the University of Iowa Museum of Art and in 1990 at the Fresno Art Museum in California. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Fresno Art Museum and the Israel Museum.         An exhibition of her work is to open at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery on April 12; the Knoedler Gallery plans a show of the Averys' portraits of each other, also for April.         Mrs. Avery is survived by her daughter, March Avery Cavanaugh, and her grandson, Sean Avery Cavanaugh, who are artists in New York.       
         Mary Ellis, the young opera singer for whom Rudolf Friml wrote ''Rose-Marie'' in 1924 and who later became the queen of musicals in London, died there on Thursday at her home on Eaton Square. She was 105, including the three years that Hollywood publicists subtracted in the 1930's.         Her title role in the operetta ''Rose-Marie,'' her first venture into musical theater, was one of the biggest Broadway hits of the 1920's, running for 558 performances. Arthur Hammerstein, the producer, ordered it written especially for her, and long before Jeanette MacDonald's hit version of ''Indian Love Call'' from the 1936 film adaptation, critics universally hailed Miss Ellis's highly trained singing.         Her dramatic career lasted until she was 97, although she appeared exclusively in England after the 1930's, partly because of a breach with Hammerstein that kept her permanently off the American musical stage.         Her London stage consort, the composer and actor Ivor Novello, a leading rival of Noël Coward, called her his inspiration and built several hits around her. She also had a major London success with Jerome Kern's ''Music in the Air.''         Miss Ellis's glamorous circle included Fred and Adele Astaire, Harpo Marx and George Gershwin, with whom she fell fruitlessly in love. In her Hollywood career, Fritz Lang and Marlene Dietrich were her great friends. Her personal life was chronicled, husband by husband, in the press. ''We were all mad and in love with life and work, and each other,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Those Dancing Years'' (John Murray, 1982).         Miss Ellis was born May Belle Elsas on June 15, 1897, at 131 West 95th Street in Manhattan. Her name, considered too German sounding, was changed when she joined the Metropolitan Opera.         Her father, who had arrived from Germany with only a few coins in his pocket, eventually became president of Consolidated Paper Mills. Her mother showed promise as a concert pianist before her marriage.         Miss Ellis's parents wanted her to be a painter, but after hearing Geraldine Farrar sing, she once said, ''there was nothing in my mind but opera.''         At 18, she signed a four-year contract with the Met. She had important roles, including Mityl in the premiere of Albert Wolff's ''Blue Bird.'' She sang a minor part with Enrico Caruso in one of his last performances, in Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' in Brooklyn in 1920.         Against all advice, she left the Met to act in Shakespearean productions on Broadway for the actor and producer David Belasco. That work led to ''Rose-Marie,'' originally about a sweet French-Canadian girl and her love for a fur trapper wrongly accused of murder. (The Canadian mountie, a minor role in the stage version, became the love interest in the movie, in which he was personified by Nelson Eddy.)         Miss Ellis left the show after a year to appear in ''The Dybbuk,'' a dramatic production at the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, where she happily traded a weekly paycheck of $500 for one of $10. Arthur Hammerstein was furious and forced her to sign an agreement preventing her from singing for any management but his. She never sang onstage in the United States again.         Miss Ellis had already been divorced twice when she began appearing with Basil Sydney, an English matinee idol, in productions that included a long-running modern-dress version of ''The Taming of the Shrew. They married on a whim in 1929.         There were professional tensions between the two, some caused by the offers she received to act in plays and films for which her husband was turned down. They appeared together in many plays in London until their marriage collapsed in a highly public divorce. But she was always busy with her own career, including a deal to make three pictures for Paramount.         Though her movies, including ''All the King's Horses'' (1934), were considered mediocre at best, her own acting and singing voice drew praise. Graham Greene lamented ''the waste of her sensuous appeal, her Bacchanalian gleam'' in that film.         She also appeared successfully in dramas, like the London production of ''Strange Interlude'' in 1931. But her greatest fame was in musicals, and by the late 1930's, she was one of the most popular stars of the West End, appearing in shows created by Novello and in costumes by Cecil Beaton. Some of the shows Novello wrote for her included ''Glamorous Night'' and ''The Dancing Years.''         During World War II, Miss Ellis spent three years working as an ambulance driver and a practical nurse. She went on to win excellent reviews for a string of postwar roles, including a leading part in Terence Rattigan's hit drama ''The Browning Version.''         She retired from the stage in 1970 but continued to act on television and in radio plays. Her last role, in 1994, was in the Sherlock Holmes television series starring Jeremy Brett.         Miss Ellis leaves no immediate survivors. Her last husband was Jock Muir Stewart Robinson, whom she married in 1938 after a hectic courtship. He was an enthusiastic pilot, skier and climber, and although she hated mountain climbing, she willingly accompanied him. He died in a climbing accident in 1950. She never married again.       
         Amy Sue Rosen, a modern dance choreographer known for her collaborations with the painter Derek Bernstein, died on Feb. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, according to Mr. Bernstein, her husband.         Ms. Rosen, who was born in Baltimore, trained with Bill Evans and at Arizona State University and the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies in New York.         She began to work with Mr. Bernstein in 1983, shortly after coming to New York. Early on, their collaborations were consistently nonliteral, but with a compelling simplicity. Most have implied narratives, with mysterious characters undergoing mysterious experiences that are often melancholy or darkly funny, but too plain-spoken to be surreal.         Her dances were often based on autobiographical events. Her creative philosophy was ''go there and see where you go,'' Mr. Bernstein said recently. ''She never tried to explain anything.''         In her 1991 ''Boulder,'' men and women in gray raced, crawled and lingered on a jetty of dark rocks and were confronted by a pregnant woman in a red gown. Two years ago, Ms. Rosen and Mr. Bernstein began to create pieces that addressed her illness, culminating in ''Break/Broke,'' which has its last performance today at the Dance Theater Workshop.         Her work has also been performed at the Danspace Project, the Kitchen and other dance theaters in Manhattan, and at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., where she was named the Samuel H. Scripps/American Dance Festival Humphrey-Weidman-Limón fellow in 1994.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Rosen is survived by three children, Sylve, Gustin and Vera, all of Manhattan; her mother, Claire Gelb of Tucson; and two sisters, Lisa, of Eugene, Ore., and Judy, of Estes Park, Colo.       
         Barbara Doyle Duncan, who collected, exhibited and wrote about modern Latin American art when the field was still little known to much of the United States art world, died on March 28 at her home in New York. She was 82.         Ms. Duncan's interest in Latin American art began when she and her husband, John C. Duncan, a businessman, lived in Lima, Peru, from 1947 to 1955. There, and on quick trips elsewhere, she met artists and bought their work.         In New York in the 1960's, she earned a master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts, for which she wrote two theses, one on colonial Peruvian religious art, the other on the painter Joaquín Torres-García (1874-1949).         In 1977 she organized the influential exhibition ''Recent Latin American Drawings (1969-1976): Lines of Vision,'' which included 100 artists, and in 1985 she organized another important show, ''Gloria in Excelsis: The Virgin and Angels in Viceregal Painting of Peru and Bolivia.'' Each exhibition appeared at the Americas Society in Manhattan.         In 1979 she helped plan the first auction of Latin American art at Sotheby's in New York. It was an unexpected success and did much to give that art a wider public and institutional presence.         She and her husband donated their collection, considered one of the best ensembles of post-1960's Latin American work in the United States, to the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery (now the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art) at the University of Texas, Austin, to which Ms. Duncan also gave a substantial collection of archival material.         In addition to being on the board of directors of the Americas Society, she was a life trustee of the International House, New York; and a director of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art.         In an interview in the catalog for the 1997 exhibition ''Realigning Vision: Alternative Currents in South American Drawing,'' organized by the University of Texas on the model of one of her earlier shows, she said that what she found distinctive about the art to which she had devoted her attention was its ''reluctance to give up the subject of the human condition.''         Ms. Duncan is survived by her husband of 62 years, who lives in New York; a son, Craig Duncan, of Greenwich, Conn; two daughters, Lynn Tarbox of Tampa, Fla., and Gail Simmons of New York; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Caroline H. Newhouse, a philanthropist and artist who was the widow of Theodore Newhouse, a co-founder of the Newhouse communications company, died on Saturday at her weekend home in Roxbury, Conn. She was 94 and lived in Manhattan.         Her husband, whom she wed in 1956, and his brothers Samuel I. and Norman created one of the country's largest communications conglomerates, whose parent company is now called Advance Publications Inc. Theodore died in 1998. Mrs. Newhouse was an aunt of S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Condé Nast Publications, owned by Advance Publications.         With her husband and on her own, she supported numerous cultural organizations in New York City with fund-raising and direct help. They included Career Transition for Dancers, an organization that she and her husband started, which helps dancers move on to new careers after they stop dancing.         She was one of the New York City Opera's original board members. After she retired from that post, she encouraged her nephew Mark Newhouse to join the board. He later became its president.         Born in a village near the city of Koblenz in western Germany, she originally had the surname Herz. She began studying the arts in Germany and became a sculptor and painter. She came to the United States in 1934 and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan.         She is survived by two grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.         Correction:  May 1, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Caroline Newhouse, a philanthropist and widow of a founder of the Newhouse communications company, misstated her age. She was 93, not 94.       
         Ella King Torrey, former president of the San Francisco Art Institute and an innovative arts administrator, died Wednesday at her home in San Francisco. She was 45.         Her family did not disclose the cause of death.         Ms. Torrey, who was called by both her first and middle names, and was the fifth-generation Ella King in her family, was inspired most of her life by the importance of individual artists and grass-roots artistic collaborations. She pursued this interest in several ways, from organizing exhibitions and writing to frequently participating on panels for the National Endowment for the Arts.         ''Her whole focus was creating opportunities for artists,'' said John Killacky, an officer at the San Francisco Foundation. ''In every situation, she was an animator, a cultural animator.''         Ms. Torrey was born in 1957 in Bronxville, N.Y., and grew up in Evansville, Ind., and Philadelphia. She graduated cum laude in 1980 from Yale University, where she majored in art history and wrote her senior essay on the effect of Barbie dolls on popular culture. Her interest in contemporary folk art took her to the University of Mississippi, where she wrote her master's thesis on Theora Hamblett, a little-known visionary folk painter, and became deeply involved with black quilt-makers. She was charter president of Afro-American Quilters Inc., a nonprofit cooperative in Oxford, Miss.         In 1985, she became a program officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia, where her projects included rehabilitating buildings for artists' subsidized housing. Pushing the Pew to support individual artists as well as institutions, she founded and headed the Pew Artists Fellowship Program, which awards 12 $50,000 grants to artists annually.         Ms. Torrey became president of the San Francisco Art Institute in 1995, when it was in physical and financial disarray. Widely credited with raising this art school's national and international profile, she more than tripled its endowment, oversaw the renovation and expansion of its landmark building, added several new trustees, re-established its visiting artists' program and also established an exchange program with Oxford University.         In early 2001, an auditing firm found irregularities in the way the institute's chief financial officer and comptroller had been keeping its books. In April 2002, Ms. Torrey resigned. ''I felt I had accomplished much of what I set out to do,'' she told The San Francisco Chronicle. Several board members then resigned in protest.         Ms. Torrey is survived by her mother, Ella Russell Torrey of Philadelphia; a sister, Elizabeth L. Torrey of Washington; and a brother, L. Russell Torrey of Villanova, Pa.         Correction:  May 17, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on May 3 about Ella King Torrey, a former president of the San Francisco Art Institute, misstated its fiscal situation in 1995, when she took the post. While the institute had often run a deficit, sometimes amounting to half its annual budget, it had begun to reduce deficits since the mid-1980's and to address many of its structural problems. It was not in financial or physical disarray.       
         Janet Collins, prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House in the early 1950's and one of a very few black women to become prominent in American classical ballet, died on Wednesday in Fort Worth. She was 86 and lived there.         Ms. Collins taught dance, choreographed, performed on Broadway and in film and appeared frequently on television. But she was best known as the exquisitely beautiful dancer who was the first black artist to perform at the Metropolitan, four years before Marian Anderson sang there.         ''She was a great inspiration to me as a child in Trinidad,'' the dancer and painter Geoffrey Holder said. ''What she did by dancing the way she did -- to be prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House -- gave everybody hope.''         Ms. Collins made her New York debut in 1949, dancing in her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street Y. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described her as ''the most exciting young dancer who has flashed across the current scene in a long time,'' calling her style an eclectic mix of modern dance and ballet.         ''There is a wonderful sense of aliveness in the dancer's presence and in her moving,'' Martin wrote. ''She is not self-absorbed, but is dancing completely and wholesouledly for an audience. On the other hand, there is no air of showing off about it, no coyness or coquetry, but only an apparent desire to establish and maintain a communicative contact.'' He praised her for the sharp, clean precision, ''the piquant tang, the arresting mental vigor'' of her dancing and choreography.         Ms. Collins's next triumph came the following year on Broadway in the Cole Porter musical ''Out of This World.'' Playing the role of Night, she danced an airborne solo created for her by Hanya Holm. She went from there to the Metropolitan, where she appeared as a principal dancer.         She performed lead roles in ''Aida,'' ''Carmen,'' the Dance of the Hours in ''La Gioconda'' and the Bacchanale in ''Samson and Delilah.''         It was not until two decades after she left the Met, however, that she was to receive major attention again in New York when, in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance.         Born in New Orleans, Ms. Collins moved with her family to Los Angeles at age 4.         She received her first dance training at a Catholic community center and went on to study primarily with Carmelita Maracci, one of the few ballet teachers who accepted black students, and with Lester Horton and Adolph Bolm.         She auditioned in Los Angeles for the Ballet Russe but said she had been told that she would either have to have special roles created for her or dance in white face.         ''I said no,'' she told Anna Kisselgoff in a 1974 interview in The Times. ''I sat on the steps and I cried and cried.'' But the rejection spurred her, she said, to work even harder, hard enough to be an exception.         Ms. Collins danced with Katherine Dunham and performed with the Dunham company in the 1943 film musical ''Stormy Weather.''         She also danced a solo choreographed by Jack Cole in the 1946 film ''The Thrill of Brazil,'' and worked with the filmmaker Maya Deren.         She toured with Talley Beatty in a nightclub act that was sometimes billed as Rea and Rico De Gard to prevent speculation about the two light-skinned dancers' race.         Ms. Collins was most active during the 1950's, when she toured with her own dance group throughout the United States and Canada and taught at academies including the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet; Harkness House; and the San Francisco Ballet School.         Ms. Collins is survived by a brother, Earnest, of Fort Worth, and a sister, Betty Wilkerson of Pasadena, Calif.         Correction:  June 7, 2003, Saturday  An obituary last Saturday about Janet Collins, a former prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House, misstated the precedent for black artists there. Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and several other performers at a jazz concert in 1944 were the first; Ms. Collins first appeared in 1951.       
         Jocelyn Herbert, a noted British stage designer, died on Tuesday in London. She was 86.         She is remembered in Britain for her austere, intelligently illuminated and evocative stage settings. They included the sets for the 1964 production of ''Othello,'' with Laurence Olivier, at the National Theater in London.         She also designed for opera, notably for the Metropolitan Opera's 1977 production of ''Lulu,'' for which her sets and costumes evoked a world touched by the Bauhaus, Art Moderne and German bourgeois styles.         She was educated chiefly in British schools, including the Slade School of Art, where she studied stage design.         In the mid-1950's she became a scene painter for the Royal Court Theater in London for a time. She designed for stage productions including Ionesco's ''Chairs'' (1958) and Arnold Wesker's ''Roots'' (1959), both at the Royal Court, and John Osborne's play ''Luther'' at the St. James Theater in Manhattan in 1963. Beginning in the late 1960's she designed opera for several institutional clients. She also did design work on various movies, including ''The Hotel New Hampshire'' and ''The Whales of August.''         She was born in London to Sir Alan P. Herbert, a member of Parliament, writer and humorist, and his wife, Gwendolen.         She is survived by a son and three daughters.       
         Doris Bass Andrews, who with her husband, Sperry Andrews, pursued the preservation of Weir Farm, where the Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir and friends met for painting and social activity, died on May 25 in Danbury, Conn. She was 82.         The farm, in Ridgefield and Wilton, Conn., is now the Weir Farm National Historic Site, with programs for both artists and the public. The programs are run by the Weir Farm Trust, a private nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the National Park Service.         Doris Bass was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from the Erskine School in Boston. She was an Army telegraph operator during World War II and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1947, she married Mr. Andrews, a fellow student, and they became working artists who painted in watercolors.         In the late 1950's they bought the buildings that Weir owned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1982, amid plans to build housing on former Weir farmland owned by others, the Andrewses were among those campaigning to preserve the site. Sixty acres of the original farm won historic status in 1990.         The trust's programs for professional artists include a competitive artist-in-residence program and a regional visiting artist program.         Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Catherine Barrett Andrews of Madison, Ga.; two sons, Charles Sperry Andrews IV of Sedona, Ariz., and Albert Ballard Andrews of Wilton; and a brother, Bruce Bass of Louisville.       
         Patricia Broderick, a writer and painter who was the mother of the actor Matthew Broderick, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her son said.         Raised in Manhattan on the Upper East Side but a devotee of the bohemian Village, Ms. Broderick had a wide range of interests and callings. An artist in her teens, she began writing plays in the 1940's; several were performed in New York and London, sometimes featuring her husband, the actor James Broderick, who died in 1982.         In 1996, her film, ''Infinity,'' a love story based on the life of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, was released to generally good reviews and was shown at the Toronto Film Festival. The film was a family affair; Matthew Broderick both directed and starred. Ms. Broderick also worked on the script of ''Glory,'' the 1989 Civil War drama, which starred her son as a young commander in charge of an all-black regiment.         Ms. Broderick continued painting and had her work shown in several galleries in New York and across the country, both in solo shows and with the work of her partner of the last six years, the painter John Wesley.         In addition to Mr. Wesley and her son, Ms. Broderick is survived by two daughters, the Rev. Janet Broderick Kraft and Martha Broderick; a brother, Richard Biow; and five grandchildren.
