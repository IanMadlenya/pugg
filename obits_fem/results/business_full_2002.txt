         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les Célébrités, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Jean Patchett, a leading fashion model of the 1950's whose face was one of the signatures of a highly glamorous era, died on Jan. 22 at her home in La Quinta, Calif. She was 75.         The cause was emphysema, her husband, Louis Auer, said.         In a photograph in profile by Erwin Blumenfeld for the famous Jan. 1, 1950, cover of Vogue, Ms. Patchett's immaculate red mouth, penciled left eye and natural beauty mark became shorthand for an entire decade.         Although she worked frequently with the photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe and John Rawlings, Ms. Patchett was most frequently associated with Irving Penn, especially after a 1949 photograph he took of her chewing pensively on a string of pearls as she sat in a cafe, a picture that came about spontaneously. In later sessions, Mr. Penn would give her the suggestion of a story -- meeting a beau in a crowded theater, perhaps -- and as Ms. Patchett stretched her neck longer and longer in search of the imaginary boyfriend, he would click off image after image.         She was ''a young American goddess in Paris couture,'' Mr. Penn said on Monday. Ms. Patchett was among a handful of photographic models who dominated that era, a sorority that included Dovima, Dorian Leigh, Suzy Parker, Evelyn Tripp and Lisa Fonssagrives, who was married to Mr. Penn.         Ms. Patchett arrived in New York in 1948 from her family's home in Preston, Md., on the Eastern Shore. As she told the writer Michael Gross for his book ''Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women'' (Morrow, 1995), she moved into a Methodist rooming house for women, for $13.50 a week, and signed with Harry Conover's agency. Within a month, however, she had left for the new Ford modeling agency. That September she had her first Vogue cover.         By the time she retired in the early 1960's to raise a family, Ms. Patchett had appeared on more than 40 magazine covers, Eileen Ford said.         In a period when models could be deliciously snooty, Ms. Patchett was more modest: not the girl-next-door type, but not as sophisticated as Ms. Parker, either. She was punctual and polite, often saying ''yes, ma'am'' and ''no, sir.'' When she introduced herself to an editor or a photographer, she said: ''I'm Jean Patchett. You don't darn it. You patch it.''         Asked how Ms. Patchett dressed in that period, Mrs. Ford said, with some pride, ''We all shopped at Loehmann's.''         Ms. Patchett was pursued by many men, many of them wealthy. She was seen frequently at the Stork Club and was a regular at the Friday lunch that the club's owner, Sherman Billingsley, gave for models.         When Mr. Auer, a banker, met Ms. Patchett in 1948, he was living at the Yale Club. ''A couple of models I knew who lived at the Barbizon said, 'We've got a girl for you,' '' Mr. Auer recalled. ''We met at a luncheonette near the old DuMont studios.'' Soon after they started going out, Mr. Auer gave Ms. Patchett the nickname Pancho, which stuck. They married in 1951.         Ms. Patchett continued to model regularly until 1963. In the early 1980's, she and her husband moved to La Quinta.         In addition to Mr. Auer, Ms. Patchett is survived by their daughter, Amy Auer of Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; a sister, Mrs. J. Fred King; and a brother, Frank Patchet.       
         Pauline Trigère, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan last night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley. She was 93.         ''Fashion is what people tell you to wear,'' she often said. ''Style is what comes from your own inner thing.'' She herself was an exemplar of style, and was described by her peers as ''a truly intellectual designer'' and ''a creator of timeless fashion'' in ready-to-wear clothes.         Her 50th anniversary in fashion, a milestone reached by no other designer in this country, was celebrated in 1992 at a benefit fashion show and dinner at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. It was attended by 600 of the most influential names in design, manufacturing and retailing, as well as by scores of social and theater personalities who were both clients and friends. The following year, at a ceremony at Lincoln Center, Miss Trigère received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America.         She was noted not only for her designing skills, but also for her tailoring and such touches as constructing dresses with no obvious seams.         She did not sketch her designs: in the tradition of Lanvin and Chanel, she cut and draped from bolts of fabric. Her clothes were worn by such women as Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Beverly Sills, Evelyn Lauder, Rita Gam and Dina Merrill.         Miss Trigère wore only her own designs, and she generally punctuated them with several of her trademark turtle pins. She was known both for her meticulous grooming and for a charm that surmounted her blunt, sometimes impolitic comments, spoken in a Gallic accent she never lost.         On occasion a prima donna, a description she never challenged (she once told an assistant ''There is room for only one prima donna around here, and that's me''), she was often impatient. But her displays of temper were brief. She admitted that she was outspoken to a fault, but seemed to revel in that image. A woman meeting her at a social event once gushed, ''Oh, Miss Trigère, I have a dress of yours that I've worn for 25 years.'' The designer fixed her with an icy glance and said, ''Just what am I to do with that piece of information?''         Once, when she was approached by two retailers while dining in a restaurant after one of her shows, she asked them, ''Did you come to copy or to buy?''         She was also a woman of strong beliefs. In 1961, she became the first name designer to use an African- American model. She rarely hesitated to offer an opinion and had no reservations about discussing her life and background -- with one exception. She steadfastly refused to reveal her age and sloughed off questions on the subject with ''I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond and I don't touch it up.'' For years, a silver streak intersected her simple hair style, but gradually she allowed the streak to evolve into a blend of salt sprinkled with pepper.         She finally revealed her age in 1998 when she held a 90th-birthday party for herself with 200 guests at La Grenouille restaurant in Manhattan. (During the festivities she announced that her age on the invitation had been printed upside down).         Unlike almost all other name designers, who stage their shows without commentary and emerge only at the finale to the sound of applause, Miss Trigère usually stood on the stage during her presentations, eyes partly obscured by tinted glasses, and talked about each design as it appeared. She interspersed information about fabric and style with somewhat Rabelaisian humor. Typical of her remarks was one she made at the appearance of a dress with a particularly revealing décolletage. ''You can see the boobs better,'' she said. During a personal appearance, she was asked what she really wanted to be. ''A courtesan,'' she replied.         Miss Trigère was born in 1908 in the Pigalle district of Paris to Russian-Jewish parents. Her mother was a dressmaker and her father a tailor who had made military uniforms for Russian aristocrats. She grew up behind the shop in Paris and picked up pins for a few centimes a week. She remembered designing her first dress in her early teens, although, she said, she never particularly wanted or intended to be in the fashion business. As a young woman, she preferred taking part in amateur theatrical productions and even thought of becoming a surgeon, an ambition nipped by her father before it was even a bud.         She married Lazar Radley, a Russian immigrant and a tailor, because, she said, ''I was young, my mother worried about me, he wanted to marry me and so I did.'' She had two sons before her husband, increasingly concerned about the rise of Hitler, decided to leave France. The Radleys left Paris in 1937 and were bound for Chile with what was to be a brief stopover in New York. But, she recalled, ''New York captured my heart,'' and the family settled in Manhattan.         Within a short time, the Radleys opened a small tailoring business with Miss Trigère's brother, Robert.         Five years later, in 1942, Mr. Radley walked out on the marriage, leaving his wife to bring up the two children. Some years later, he wrote to ask for a divorce. Miss Trigère signed the papers and never heard from him again. She did not remarry, but she had several of what she termed ''longstanding friendships.''         ''Don't say 'beaux' -- I hate the word 'beau,' '' she always exclaimed when the subject came up.         She is survived by her two sons, Jean-Pierre Radley and Philippe Radley and a granddaughter, Karen, all of Manhattan.         Although the original business ended when Mr. Radley left, the following year, Miss Trigère and her brother were back with a collection of 11 styles. Within three years, her name was a recognized one in fashion. In the ensuing decades, she received, in addition to three Coty Awards and inclusion in the Coty Hall of Fame, major fashion awards from Neiman Marcus and Filene's, the National Cotton Award and both the silver and the vermeil medals of the City of Paris.         In addition to creating women's fashions, at various times Miss Trigère also designed scarves, jewelry and men's ties. She also developed her own perfume, called Trigère.         Although new and younger designers gradually replaced her at the top of the fashion hierarchy, and a number of stores that had been important customers went out of business, Miss Trigère continued to design collections and to take part in fashion press weeks until 1994. She closed her ready-to-wear business at that time, partly because several of her principal accounts went into bankruptcy, owing her money. She moved out of her prestigious Seventh Avenue showrooms and took a small space elsewhere in the fashion district, forming a company called P. T. Concepts to market her scarves and jewelry. It was during this period that she underwent several eye and throat operations. She gave up even her smaller space in 2000.         Despite her sophistication, she never lost a sense of delight and wonder at the friendships she enjoyed with many of the illustrious names in the fashion, arts, business and political worlds. She entertained frequently, both in her Manhattan apartment and at her country house, called La Tortue (the Turtle), in South Salem, N.Y. She was known as an excellent cook, and in both homes the atmosphere was informal but carefully orchestrated. She was one of the first hostesses to set a formal table but to have guests follow her into the kitchen to pick up their second courses buffet style.         Once she bought her country house, she spent several years tripling its size. ''I'm engaged, married and completely devoted to this house,'' she once said. She was equally passionate about the grounds, and was a dedicated and knowledgeable gardener.         She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country.         ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline Trigère.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.         Miss Trigère's family said there would be a viewing tonight at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on the Upper West Side.       
         Pauline Trigère, the Paris-born designer who was not only her own best model but also an elegant and chic symbol of the American fashion industry for more than half a century, died at her home on the East Side of Manhattan on Wednesday night, said her daughter-in-law Melanie Radley.

She was dedicated, also, to her adopted country. ''People always say to me, 'Aren't you French?' and I say, 'No, I am American,' '' she said. ''I found in this country everything I wanted. This country made me Pauline Trigère.''         Shortly after her 90th birthday, she told friends that she had left instructions that she wanted to be cremated wearing her trademark bright red lipstick. ''What does it matter?'' one friend asked. ''Who will know whether or not you have lipstick on?''         ''I'll know,'' she said.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.         Correction:  March 15, 2002, Friday  An obituary on March 6 about Theresa Castro, who with her husband established the company that makes Castro Convertible sofas, omitted some survivors. Mrs. Castro had six grandchildren, not four, and seven great-grandchildren, not five.       
         Rosetta LeNoire, a theatrical producer and a pioneer of nontraditional casting who also played the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on the television show ''Family Matters,'' died on Sunday in Teaneck, N.J. She was 90.         She lived at the Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home in Englewood, N.J., after spending most of her life in the Bronx, said Donna Trinkoff, producing director of the Amas Musical Theater. Miss LeNoire founded Amas, a nonprofit theater group, in 1968, partly to promote interracial casting. The company produced hits including ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         Miss LeNoire's life coincided with glittering moments in show business. Her godfather was Bill Robinson, the tap dancer known as Bojangles, and her music teacher was the jazz pianist and composer Eubie Blake. She was directed by Orson Welles in his all-black version of ''Macbeth'' in the 1930's.         She acted in some of the earliest television shows, and once joked that she seemed to play every maid's role on Broadway.         Perhaps as a result, she was an early and effective advocate of expanding opportunities for minority performers to act in plays and musicals. In 1989, her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who was then president of Actors' Equity, chose Miss LeNoire as the first recipient of what became the union's annual award for broadening participation in theater. The award was named for her.         ''Rosetta created nontraditional casting before the phrase itself was created,'' The New York Beacon, a newspaper with a largely black readership, said in 1997.         In 1999, President Clinton lauded her long fight against discrimination as he presented her with the National Medal of the Arts, one of her many honors.         ''Rosetta did more than dream of a theater with no color bar -- she actually built one,'' he said.         Miss LeNoire, whose name was originally Rosetta Burton, was born in 1911 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan. Her paternal grandfather played the organ for five churches in the West Indies, and her father was one of the first black plumbers and electricians licensed by New York State.         When she was a child, her mother died of pneumonia at the age of 27 after giving birth to her brother in a Harlem hospital corridor because segregated policies barred her from a room. Rosetta was crippled with rickets, a result of vitamin deprivation, and when she was 7 doctors broke her legs so the bones could grow properly.         Mr. Robinson, a member of the Elks Club with her father, volunteered to become godfather of the girl he called Brown Sugar. At 13, when her leg braces came off, she began music lessons with Mr. Blake, who told her to ''look up and be proud of yourself.'' When she was 15, she became a chorus girl with the Time Steppers, Mr. Robinson's troupe.         A marriage to an elevator operator ended in divorce. She then married Egbert Brown, who owned a fleet of cabs; he died after 26 years of marriage.         She is survived by her son, William, of Manahawkin, N.J.; her sister, Mary A. Francis of Palm Coast, Fla.; her brothers, Wilmote Burton of the Bronx, and Warren Burton of Palm Coast; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Study at a government-sponsored Works Progress Administration program at a theater on the Lower East Side led to a role in the all-black version of ''Macbeth,'' which Orson Welles was producing in Harlem. She toured with the production.         ''Good lord! He was a delegate from heaven,'' she said of Mr. Welles. ''He was the only one who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to Shakespeare.''         Later she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to acting, she cared for Mr. Jones's infant son, James Earl Jones.         She made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''The Hot Mikado,'' an all-black version of the operetta.         ''It was something,'' she said. ''There were 125 of us, all black Japanese.''         Her other theater credits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Sunshine Boys,'' ''Lost in the Stars,'' ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Sophie.'' She played the role of Stella in ''Anna Lucasta'' in 1944, toured with the show and starred in the 1958 film version, with Sammy Davis Jr. and Eartha Kitt. Her other movie credits include ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Playing for Keeps'' and ''Brewster's Millions.''         She worked in television during its experimental days, and later appeared in ''Search for Tomorrow,'' ''The Guiding Light,'' ''Amen'' and ''A World Apart. She played Nell Carter's mother, Mama, on NBC's ''Gimme a Break'' and was Mother Winslow on ABC's ''Family Matters'' for eight years.         Eight years after founding Amas, she added a children's theatrical course to its program. (Amas is a form of the verb ''to love'' in Latin.) The company's hits included ''Bojangles'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' a Tony nominee in 1976.         ''I produce musicals,'' she said. ''Music is one avenue where no one seems to have any discriminatory attitudes.''       
         Dorothy DeLay, one of the world's most famous teachers of the violin and a mentor to two generations of players ranging from Itzhak Perlman to Midori and Sarah Chang, died on Sunday. She was 84 and lived in Upper Nyack, N.Y.         Miss DeLay, as her students continued to call her even after they became star performers, began her teaching career almost as an afterthought in 1947, when she was a student of Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School. Accepting a handful of invitations for part-time teaching and assistantships at the Henry Street Settlement, the Juilliard School and Sarah Lawrence College led her to realize that she enjoyed teaching more than she enjoyed performing.         For more than 20 years she worked largely in Galamian's shadow, but in the 1970's she became a sought-after teacher in her own right, and became the first woman -- and the first American-born violnist -- to be regarded as a master violin teacher in the tradition of Galamian and Leopold Auer.         The list of students who became famous soon after leaving her studio quickly blossomed starting in the 1970's. In addition to Mr. Perlman, Midori and Ms. Chang, they include Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Nigel Kennedy, Gil Shaham, Shlomo Mintz and Cho-Liang Lin. Also among her pupils are members and often founders of some of the world's great chamber groups, among them the Juilliard, the Tokyo, the Cleveland, the Vermeer, the Takacs and the Ying Quartets. Others like Joseph Swenson and Peter Oundjian became conductors and many became concertmasters and section players in orchestras around the world as well as members of conservatory faculties. At the Juilliard School, the faculty includes 14 of her former students.         Miss DeLay was as well known for her easygoing, direct manner and her homey advice as she was for the demanding five-hour practice regimen she recommended in which full hours were devoted to technical basics, etudes, repertory pieces, concertos and works by Bach but also in which 10-minute breaks between hours were allowed. Instead of imposing her views about the great violin repertory on her pupils, she encouraged them to discuss their own interpretive ideas. If they appeared to be on the wrong path, she would gently steer them right. Some of her former students described her work in Zen-like terms.         ''I think the greatest things about Dorothy DeLay,'' Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg said in a 1992 interview, ''is that she has the ability to look at a young student or an old student and pretty much size up their character and the way that they think -- their personality, basically -- and how in a short period of time what's the best door to use to get them into here. And that's her method -- that fact that there is really no method.''         Yet Miss DeLay's easygoing manner was not to be taken entirely at face value. Having molded dozens of top-flight soloists, she also became an important power broker in the music business. Conductors and managers trusted her advice.         Dorothy DeLay was born on March 31, 1917, in Medicine Lodge, Kan. Her parents were both musicians and teachers. She later described the household as strict and religious and said that her mother briefly toured the country with Carry Nation, campaigning against alcohol. Miss DeLay began playing the violin when she was 4 and gave a recital at her church when she was 5. When she was 16, she enrolled at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio, where she studied the violin with Raymond Cerf, a student of the Belgian virtuoso and composer Eugène Ysaye.         After a year Miss DeLay transferred to Michigan State University, after her parents decided that they did not want her to study solely music. But the violin remained her focus, and after her graduation in 1937, when she was 20, she moved to New York and enrolled at the Juilliard School to continue her studies with Louis Persinger, Hans Letz and Felix Salmond. As a student, Miss DeLay supported herself by working as a baby sitter and playing the violin in restaurants, at weddings and in Broadway theater orchestras. But she also began performing as a recitalist and in a chamber ensemble, the Stuyvesant Trio, which included her sister Nellis, a cellist, and Helen Brainard, a pianist; and she toured Latin America as a member of Leopold Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra.         During a cross-country train journey at the end of the All-American Youth Orchestra tour in 1940, Miss DeLay met Edward Newhouse, a novelist and short story writer for The New Yorker. They were married early in 1941 after a courtship of four months. Mr. Newhouse survives Miss DeLay, as do their son, Jeffrey Newhouse, of Bronxville, and their daughter, Alison Dinsmore, of Boston, as well as four grandchildren.         Miss DeLay continued touring as a soloist and with the Stuyvesant Trio after her marriage, but by the mid-1940's she decided that she did not like performing. She briefly considered studying medicine but decided instead to return to the Juilliard School in 1946 for more violin studies. Her teacher was Galamian; two years later she became his assistant, both at Juilliard and at the summer camp he had established in 1944, Meadowmount.         It was Galamian's devotion to teaching that inspired Miss DeLay to give it a try. She maintained her association with the Juilliard School for the rest of her life and taught at Sarah Lawrence College from 1947 to 1987. Her other teaching associations included Meadowmount, Aspen, the University of Cincinnati, the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, the New England Conservatory, and the Royal College of Music in London.         By the late 1960's Miss DeLay's relationship with Galamian became strained, partly because of growing differences in their teaching methods and philosophies. But there were personal tensions as well, and their relationship ruptured entirely in 1970 when Miss DeLay telephoned Galamian to say that she would teach the following summer at Aspen instead of at his Meadowmount school. Galamian never spoke with Miss DeLay again, and when his demand that the Juilliard School fire her was not met, he told students who were working with both of them that they had to make a choice. Among those who chose Miss DeLay was Mr. Perlman.         ''With Galamian there was almost no room for give and take because he had a particular system that he applied to everybody,'' Mr. Perlman told Barbara Lourie Sand, the author of ''Teaching Genius: Dorothy DeLay and the Making of a Musician,'' a book about Miss DeLay, published in 2000. ''Miss DeLay was much more flexible, was much more into the person, and into their background, into what makes them tick. I would come and play for her, and if something was not quite right, it wasn't like she was going to kill me.         ''That's where we come to the differences between the two. She would ask questions about what you thought of particular phrases -- where the top of the phrase was, and so on. We would have a very friendly, interesting discussion about 'Why do you think it should sound like this?' and 'What do you think of that?' I was not quite used to this way of approaching things.''         With Miss DeLay's growing fame in the 1980's and 90's came detractors, including former students who complained that she was frequently late to lessons or that her essentially anti-authoritarian mode of teaching was actually lax and uninvolved. Still, by the late 1980's, her studio had become a soloist factory of sorts: a concertgoer reading her name in the program biography of a young performer could be assured of a high level of playing and often a particular kind of sound -- lush and beautifully burnished with a big but not overwhelming vibrato.         In addition to many honorary degrees, Miss DeLay received the National Medal of Arts in 1994, the National Music Council's American Eagle Award in 1995, the Sanford Medal from Yale University in 1997 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese Government in 1998.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a  golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas.

In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.       
         Esther Afua Ocloo, who as a young woman turned a gift of less than a dollar into 12 jars of marmalade -- which she sold for a profit -- and went on to become one of Ghana's leading entrepreneurs and a prominent exponent of the role of women in economic development, died on Feb. 8 in Accra, Ghana. She was 83.         Her husband, Stephen, said she  died of pneumonia in Accra Military Hospital.         As the first chairwoman of Women's World Banking, Ms. Ocloo was one of the pioneers of microlending, the financing of homespun businesses, predominantly run by women, through very small loans, sometimes as little as $50. If a business prospers and the loan is repaid -- as more than 98 percent are -- then a larger loan is made available.         Large lending institutions give microlending institutions, like Women's World Banking, big loans of, say, $5 million. The money is then parceled out in small loans, at interest rates slightly higher than normal commercial bank rates, for enterprises as simple as drying fish.         Nancy Barry, president of Women's World Banking, said that 25 million people, three-quarters of them women, had received microloans in more than 40 less-developed countries. Half the loans are from Women's World Banking.         The idea was born at the 1975 Mexico City conference that proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Women. Ms. Ocloo found that ideas she had been developing with women in Ghana were also percolating elsewhere. The premise was simple: more than education, health care or family planning, women in poor countries need money in their pockets.         The other early leaders in the movement were Michaela Walsh, a New York investment banker, and Ela Bhatt, founder of a cooperative bank for illiterate women in India. They and several allies founded Women's World Banking in 1979 with Ms. Ocloo as chairwoman.         Ms. Barry said that concentrating on women made sense because they are discriminated against in borrowing; they do the majority of artisanal work and much of the farming, and they have a keener sense of the interdependence of generations.         Ms. Ocloo, in a speech in 1990, gave a starkly practical explanation.         ''Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power,'' she said. ''You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do.''         Esther Afua Nkulenu was born in  Peki-Dzake in the Volta region of Ghana on April 18, 1919. Her parents were poor farmers, but she was able to attend high school with the help of scholarships offered to young women by Cadbury, the chocolate company, which was a major buyer of Ghana's cocoa crop.         Her mother, with tears in her eyes, sent her off to Accra with just a sixpence. After graduating, she lived with relatives in the city. An aunt gave her 10 shillings, worth less than one United States dollar. She bought sugar, firewood, oranges and 12 jars, and made marmalade jam, which she sold for a shilling a jar.         ''I was ridiculed by all my classmates, who saw me hawking marmalade on the street like an uneducated street vendor,'' rather than seeking an office job, she said.         But she plowed her profits back into the business. She also took some of her marmalade to her old high school and won a contract to supply the entire school. Soon, school officials asked her to supply orange juice from orange trees on its grounds.         She next got a contract to supply juice to the military, but lacked the necessary funds to produce it. Though she had no collateral, she persuaded a bank to give her a loan on the basis of the contract. The result was her company, Nkulenu Industries, which grew to produce products like canned tomatoes and soup bases.         After six years, she had saved enough money to go to Britain to study food technology, preservation, nutrition and agriculture. She also learned leatherwork and lampshade-making in the hope of sharing the skills with rural women back home.         Even as she continued running her own company upon her return, she devoted more and more of her time to improving women's economic situation. For example, she established her own program on a farm to train women in agriculture, preparing and preserving food products and making handicrafts.         She paid for the program in part with her half of the Africa Prize, a $100,000 award she split with Olusegun Obasanjo, the current president of Nigeria, in 1990. It was presented by the Hunger Project for their leadership in working to end hunger in Africa.         She liked to keep things simple, as when she taught business management skills to women involved in cooking and selling food on the streets.         ''I have taught them to cost the things they sell and determine their profits,'' she said. ''You know what we found? We found that a woman selling rice and stew on the side of the street is making more money than most women in office jobs -- but they are not taken seriously.''         Ms. Ocloo, who always wore bright African clothes and loved to cook traditional meals, preferred to be known as Auntie Ocloo, in the Ghanaian tradition. She usually began meetings of bankers and others with a prayer, and often ended them with a song: ''We Are Wonderful.''         The day she entered the hospital she gave a speech urging women to carry on her campaign for micro-lending. Days before she died, she was on the phone from her hospital bed to governmental officials arguing that microloans, rather than grants, should be specified in Ghana's new budget.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Georgina Nkulenu; her daughter, Vincentia Canacco; her sons Vincent Malm, Christian Biassey and Stephen Jr., and six grandchildren.         She once said her children complained that the women she trained competed against her.         ''I don't listen,'' she said. ''My main goal is to help my fellow women. If they make better marmalade than me, I deserve the competition.''       
         Chaike Belchatowska Spiegel, one of the last surviving combatants of the 1943 Warsaw ghetto uprising against the Nazis, died in Montreal on March 26. She was 81.         She had been hospitalized for about two years, her family said.         Probably no more than 10 other combatants from the uprising are still alive, said her son-in-law, Eugene Orenstein, who teaches modern Jewish history at McGill University in Montreal.         In January 1943, Chaike Belchatowska joined the Jewish Fighting Organization, known by its Polish acronym ZOB, which had been formed the previous year to resist the deportation of Jews from the ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp by the Nazi forces that had overrun Poland in 1939.         On April 19, the first night of the Jewish feast of Passover that year, a Nazi force, equipped with tanks and artillery and under the command of Col. Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, entered the ghetto to resume the deportations, which had been suspended in January after running into stiff resistance.         This time the Nazis were repulsed from the ghetto altogether, suffering heavy losses at the hands of the ZOB and other resistance groups, all of them poorly armed with only a few smuggled guns, little ammunition and homemade gasoline bombs.         Colonel Sammern-Frankenegg was relieved of his command and replaced by Gen. Jürgen Stroop, who attacked again.         But the Nazi forces found themselves blocked once more by fierce Jewish resistance after several days of vicious street fighting.         The Germans then changed tactics and, using flame throwers, began systematically burning down the houses of the ghetto. The ZOB headquarters fell on May 8, but sporadic resistance continued into June and July.         Meanwhile, Ms. Belchatowska, together with her husband-to-be, Boruch Spiegel, the leader of a ZOB fighting unit, and some 50 other Jewish resistance fighters, managed to escape from the ghetto to the forests outside Warsaw; from there, they continued to harass the Germans until the end of the war.         After the Germans were driven from Poland by Soviet troops, Ms. Belchatowska and Mr. Spiegel moved to Sweden, where they married and where their son Chil, or Julius, was born. In late 1948 they went to Montreal after failing to obtain a visa for the United States.         Chaike Belchatowska Spiegel, who was often known in English as Helen, was born in Warsaw on Nov. 11, 1920. Her parents separated shortly afterward, and she was raised by her mother, who was an active Jewish socialist.         She inherited much of her mother's political philosophy, becoming a member of the Jewish Labor Bund, an organization founded in Czarist Russia to promote a brand of Marxist socialism that would provide cultural autonomy for Jews.         After the first mass deportations from the Warsaw ghetto in the summer of 1942, she encouraged Jews to resist being moved by every means possible.         She helped circulate a Yiddish-language paper warning that their real destination would be Treblinka and that the Nazis were lying when they encouraged volunteers by promising them more food and greater freedom.         In November of that year, she herself was herded onto a train bound for Treblinka but managed to break out of a cattle car and escape back to the ghetto.         After moving to Montreal, Mrs. Spiegel and her husband ran a business making purses and other leather goods. She is survived by her husband; their son, Julius, who is the Brooklyn parks commissioner, and their daughter, Mindy Spiegel of Montreal.       
         Ruth Fertel, who found a New Orleans restaurant called Chris Steak House in the classified ads and from it built one of the largest steakhouse chains in the world, died Tuesday in New Orleans. She was 75.         The cause was lung cancer, her company said.         Ms. Fertel came to the food business with no restaurant experience and even less culinary training. She prided herself on following her instincts with her Ruth's Chris Steak House chain.         She ignored advice from her lawyer and banker when she bought her first restaurant, and she kept the cumbersome name even as the business grew far beyond New Orleans. Today there are 82 Ruth's Chris Steak Houses in the United States and abroad, with annual sales of $328 million.         Each restaurant varies slightly in décor, depending on the location, but all cook prime steaks at extremely high heat, in a broiler Ms. Fertel designed that reaches 1,800 degrees. And all serve the steaks topped with a swath of butter for maximum flavor, as she insisted.         Ms. Fertel (pronounced fer TELL), who was divorced, was working as a lab technician at Tulane School of Medicine and looking for a way to finance her two sons' college education when she spotted a restaurant advertised for sale in 1965. In what she described as ''a case of blind ambition,'' she mortgaged her house for $22,000 to buy the place from Chris Matulich.         She was so naïve, she said, that she asked for a loan only large enough to pay for the space; the bank insisted that she take out a few thousand dollars more to buy food. She had to teach herself how to butcher.         Six months after opening, she had taken in more than twice as much as her annual salary at Tulane.         According to an interview in Fortune magazine in 1998, Mr. Matulich had granted Ms. Fertel the rights to the restaurant's long-established name as long as she kept the original location. When a fire forced her to move in 1976, she wound up appending her name to his and creating a tongue-tangler that one restaurant critic said would make a good sobriety test if repeated three times fast.         ''I've always hated the name,'' Ms. Fertel told Fortune's reporter. ''But we've always managed to work around it.''         Ms. Fertel came out of a long and unusual New Orleans tradition: an acceptance of strong women as restaurateurs, like Ella Brennan of Commander's Palace, Leah Chase of Dooky Chase and Susan Spicer of Bayona. But Ms. Fertel also catered to the good-old-boy network that flourishes in Louisiana, and from the beginning her restaurant attracted local politicians as well as athletes, businessmen and reporters.         Edwin W. Edwards, a former governor of Louisiana, described Ms. Fertel to The Associated Press as ''someone that every politician in this state knew and respected.''         She also apparently had the characteristic New Orleans attitude toward the rituals of death. According to The A.P., in 1999 she gave a lavish party to unveil the mausoleum she and a friend had bought for $500,000 in Lake Lawn Metairie Cemetery.         Ruth Udstad was born in 1927 to an insurance salesman and a kindergarten teacher. At 19, she earned a degree in chemistry from Louisiana State University, and she taught briefly at John McNeese Junior College in Lake Charles, La., before her marriage, which ended after 14 years. She is survived by her sons, Randy and Jerry, both of New Orleans, and seven grandchildren.         Ruth's Chris began expanding when she granted her first franchise in 1977, in Baton Rouge, the state capital. The first Ruth's in Manhattan opened in the Theater District in 1993. In 1999, Madison Dearborn Partners of Chicago acquired a majority interest in the chain.         Ms. Fertel was told she had lung cancer in 2000 but remained involved in the company until she was hospitalized last Friday.         After starting in a three-martini world, Ms. Fertel's business thrived through both the carbo-loading and fat-fearing eras and now benefits from the new appetite for protein, particularly in the form of hulking steaks dripping butter. In an interview with New Orleans magazine in 1997, she insisted that the beef business was virtually impervious to health trends.         ''People always go on a diet 'Monday,' '' she said. ''On Friday: 'I'm going on a diet Monday because I'm going to two restaurants this weekend.' On Sunday they renegotiate.''       
         A. J. Levinson, who pressed a national campaign to improve what she called ''the quality of death'' by promoting living wills, and who educated both professionals and the public on ways to bring dignity to dying, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was widespread cancer, her daughter Martha Levinson said.         Ann-Jane Levinson (she preferred A. J.) was executive director of Concern for Dying for 11 years beginning in 1976, a period in which thorny cases like that of Karen Ann Quinlan, who spent years on life support equipment, provoked deep questioning about how people die. Ms. Levinson's message was that family doctors, nurses and others should strive to honor the dying person's wishes.         The group, which is defunct, grew out of the Euthanasia Educational Council. Perhaps its most important accomplishment was helping develop and promote the concept of the living will. Such a will is a formal document that permits a person to record desires for how the end of life should be handled. Living wills often express the determination to die a ''natural death'' and not to have life extended artificially by life support equipment.         These documents, which millions of people in many states have prepared, can call for ending medical procedures that have been instituted in the patient's behalf. Most deputize a relative or an acquaintance to act if the patient is incapacitated, and health care proxies, their formal name, are recognized as binding in many states.         The organization sent out more than seven million forms for living wills to groups and individuals all over the country. After a single mention in an Ann Landers column, hundreds of thousands of requests poured in.         The group also advocated allowing people to have ample pain medication at the end of their lives, if they wished.         ''Doctors are afraid of things like addiction and overdosing when that isn't the primary concern to a terminal patient in severe pain,'' Ms. Levinson said in an interview in 1985 with The Record, a newspaper in northern New Jersey.         But she denounced mercy killing.         ''I don't think society should be in the business of killing people,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ''I don't think killing is a person's right.''         She was born in Boston on Jan. 7, 1929. Her mother drove an ambulance in France during World War I. Her father, Dr. John Rock, was a professor at Harvard Medical School who helped develop the first birth control pill. Earlier, he had angered the Roman Catholic Church by performing abortions.         She graduated from the Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., and Bryn Mawr, where she majored in history. She then briefly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, but never told her family what she did.         She had two daughters, Martha Levinson and Kate Ewing, both of Manhattan, and a son, Paul T. Levinson of Milton, Mass., with her husband, Henry W. Levinson, who also survives, as does a sister, Rachel Achenbach of Boxford, Mass.         In 1957, she did graduate work in psychology and sociology at Columbia, then taught at several private schools in Manhattan. She introduced courses on sex education, drug abuse and skills for urban living.         Katherine Strauss Mali, president of Concern for Dying, hired her as executive director in 1976. Martha Levinson said her mother was motivated by the vastly different experiences of two dying relatives: her brother died alone and miserable with hospital officials barring visits; while her mother died at home surrounded by loved ones.         Much of her work involved bringing people from different disciplines together in seminars about death and dying. She appeared on national television programs like ''The Tonight Show.'' She had her children stuff living wills into envelopes for mailing.         She formally retired in 1988, after suffering a debilitating stroke the previous year. She had a living will.         Her husband said she did not like death. She was interested in the conduct of living people.         Correction:  May 4, 2002, Saturday  An obituary on Wednesday about A. J. Levinson, an advocate for living wills, included a family member's erroneous reference to the work of her father, Dr. John Rock, in the field of birth control. The family says Dr. Rock, a professor at Harvard Medical School who helped develop the birth control pill, did not perform abortions.       
         Sharon L. Monsky, a scleroderma sufferer who founded an organization that raised millions of dollars to look for a cure for the disease, died on Saturday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 48 and lived in Santa Barbara.         The cause was systemic scleroderma, said Charles Spaulding, a vice president of the organization, the Scleroderma Research Foundation, which Ms. Monsky founded in 1987.         Ms. Monsky had systemic scleroderma, a chronic and painful disease afflicting the connective tissues, for two decades. She was the foundation's chairman and chief executive until she died.         ''She was a leader in raising awareness and funding in search of a cure for scleroderma,'' said Dr. M. Kari Connolly, a professor of dermatology and medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, who has been doing research about scleroderma for 10 years.         The struggle for awareness and money encountered problems. Ms. Monsky said in a 1990 interview with The New York Times: ''It's a hard one to sell. It's a mysterious disease. It's an ugly disease. And there are no scleroderma poster children to help.''         In the early 1980's, when she found out that she had scleroderma, which hardens the skin and internal organs, Ms. Monsky was given only two years to live. But as she lived on, she decided to create the foundation.         She had a master's degree in business administration and had become a highly regarded management consultant with McKinsey & Company, which she had to leave in 1985 after her health deteriorated. She applied her business expertise to the foundation.         Besides corporate donors, celebrities in the performing arts were persuaded to donate time and money to the cause.         Ms. Monsky's activities generated more than $14 million for research and helped expand understanding of the disease. Money she disbursed for basic medical research on scleroderma led to the publication of scientific articles exploring potential cures. Her work also helped make scleroderma better known.         The foundation's activities include operating two sites for research on the disease, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of California at San Francisco. The foundation also has adjunct laboratories at Ohio State, Stanford and Duke Universities.         Born in Omaha, Ms. Monsky was a top amateur figure skater as a teenager. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., and a master's degree in business administration from Stanford.         She was separated from her husband, Mark Scher.         She is survived by her mother, Ramelle Monsky of Palm Desert, Calif.; a son, Max, and two daughters, Samantha and Montana, all of Santa Barbara; a sister, Robin Monsky of Chicago; and a brother, Henry Monsky of Omaha.       
         Edna Mae Robinson, the Cotton Club star who was once married to the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, died in her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 86.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son, Ray Robinson II.         Ernestine Holly was born in 1915 to a prominent Miami family, and moved to New York City when she was 5.         Precocious on and off the dance floor, she graduated from high school at 14 and found work as a dancer, touring Europe with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway in the 1930's. At the Cotton Club, in Harlem, she was known for dancing atop an enormous drum.         In 1940, she met her future husband -- also a local celebrity -- silently and anonymously at a local pool.         The up-and-coming boxer Walker Smith Jr. -- soon to be nicknamed Sugar Ray Robinson after his borrowed identification card and smooth fighting style -- could not help noticing the preening young woman as she sauntered poolside. So he pushed her in.         Edna Mae, who could not swim, was not impressed. But she gave Mr. Robinson a second chance at a Harlem nightclub some months later, when they were formally introduced. They were married in 1943.         During their 19-year marriage, while Mr. Robinson became a five-time world middleweight champion, Mrs. Robinson stopped performing to travel with her husband. She encouraged his natty style and shared his penchant for flash as they spent and gave away Mr. Robinson's $4 million in winnings. (The couple drove a flamingo-pink Cadillac.)         In the 1950's, they owned businesses covering much of Seventh Avenue from 123rd to 124th streets, including Edna Mae's Lingerie Shop and Sugar Ray's Cafe.         After the couple divorced in 1962, she revived her show business career, appearing in television variety shows, cabaret productions and, briefly, on the New York stage in an all-black version of ''Born Yesterday.'' She never remarried.         Mr. Robinson died in 1989. Mrs. Robinson is survived by her son and five grandchildren.       
         Shirley Hayes, who waged a long battle -- called quixotic by some, psychotic by others -- that eventually succeeded in banning cars from Washington Square Park in Manhattan, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 89.         She marshaled children in strollers, including her own four sons, to press the case that Greenwich Village's only significant park had no business being a bus turnaround, much less being cut in half by a four-lane road.         She collected 16,000 signatures and the endorsements of politicians, newspapers, 12 parent-teacher associations and the Lions Club. When others sought some middle ground, say a smaller road, Mrs. Hayes spurned deal making.         ''When Shirley refused to compromise, I told her she was turning into a crackpot,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, in an interview with McCall's magazine in 1967. At the time he was a lawyer living in the Village.         ''I thought it was unreasonable to expect the city to cut a major artery and detour traffic through narrow streets,'' Mr. Koch said, ''but she proved her goal was not unrealistic.''         The long-running drama included some legendary New Yorkers: Robert Moses, the powerful official who demanded the biggest road possible, was her arch enemy. Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady who had once lived on Washington Square, was her illustrious supporter. Carmine DeSapio, the leader of Tammany Hall, was the éminence grise who at the final moment gave the quiet nod to her position.         ''This was where the tide turned against the indiscriminate taking of parkland for automotive purposes,'' said Henry J. Stern, the former city parks commissioner, who last year put up a sign in Washington Square honoring the event.         Mrs. Hayes was born Shirley Zak on June 15, 1912, in Chicago. She attended the University of Wisconsin and studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and acting at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She moved to New York in 1932 to pursue a career in acting. In 1936, she appeared in Leslie Howard's ''Hamlet,'' which was making Broadway history by competing with Sir John Gielgud's ''Hamlet.'' She played a lady in waiting and met her husband, James, during the production; he played a pallbearer.         They had four sons: Christopher, who lives in Manhattan and Los Angeles, and his twin, Kerry, who lives in Toronto, Timothy, of Manhattan and East Hampton, and Dennis, of Rio de Janeiro and Manhattan. In addition to her sons, she is survived by four grandchildren.         Mrs. Hayes, who was often busy entertaining clients for her husband, who had gone into advertising, also became involved in other neighborhood causes, like fighting the large apartment houses that Robert Moses eventually built south of Washington Square. Because she frequently took her sons to Washington Square Park, she leapt into the fight in 1952, when Mr. Moses proposed building a 48-foot roadway through it. The road -- which would have linked Fifth Avenue on the north side of the park to West Broadway on the south -- would have wiped out some playgrounds. ''A few women got together to say no, no, no,'' Mrs. Hayes said in an interview with The Villager, a neighborhood paper, last fall.         The debate took many turns; one big struggle was over what to do with the buses that already used the park as a turnaround. Eventually politicians came up with the idea of using a smaller road as a compromise. The original proposal for a below-the-ground road was changed to ground level. But Mrs. Hayes had decided she would accept nothing less than no road through the park, and no vehicles of any kind in it, including the buses.         ''She took the extreme position,'' said Anthony Dapolito, owner of Vesuvio Bakery and long a leader in Greenwich Village politics. ''She and the mothers kept insisting and wouldn't give up.''         On April 9, 1959, the city's Board of Estimate, the body that then governed the city's spending and land use, voted to oust cars entirely, shortly after Mr. DeSapio, always attuned to opinion in the Village, had passed the word that he wanted them out.         In her 1961 book, ''The Life and Death of Great American Cities,'' Jane Jacobs noted the courage of the position taken by Mrs. Hayes and her allies: ''They advocated eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all automobile traffic -- but at the same time, not widening the perimeter roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without compensating for it.''         Ms. Jacobs wrote that traffic did not become unmanageable, and that more of the low-scale profile of Greenwich Village was preserved. Others suggested that the defeat of the road represented the first nail in the coffin of Mr. Moses's plan for a Lower Manhattan expressway. The park road would have fed into the Moses freeway, which he planned to link the bridges and tunnels to Brooklyn and New Jersey.         Mrs. Hayes was divorced in 1965 and went to work as a classical radio disc jockey on WNYC's ''While the City Sleeps'' and other programs. She also worked with Mayor John V. Lindsay, for whom she campaigned, on making the city friendlier to movie companies. She was a charter member of the National Organization for Women.         Correction:  May 15, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Shirley Hayes, who successfully fought a road through Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, reversed two words in the title of a book by the urban planning critic Jane Jacobs, which praised her. It is ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' not ''Life and Death.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems as varied as acne, alcoholism and AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail.         The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers.         Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m. She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of good will to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Caroline Knapp, a writer and columnist whose memoir ''Drinking: A Love Story'' vividly chronicled her struggle to overcome alcoholism, died yesterday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 42 and lived in Cambridge.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         In ''Drinking'' Ms. Knapp wrote about the disturbing incongruities of her life as what she called a ''high-functioning alcoholic'': she was an award-winning journalist, an Ivy League graduate from a well-to-do New England family and by all appearances a happy, healthy and successful young woman. But drinking had slowly taken hold of her life, and she was desperate to conceal its effects.         She was, she wrote, ''smooth and ordered on the outside; roiling and chaotic and desperately secretive underneath, but not noticeably so, never noticeably so.''         The book, published by Dial Press in 1996, was praised by critics for its painful honestly in describing the grip of addiction and the difficulty of overcoming it. In a review in The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called it ''a remarkable exercise in self-discovery.'' The book remained on The New York Times best-seller list for several weeks in both hardcover and paperback editions.         In ''Drinking'' Ms. Knapp characterized her addiction as a bad love affair. In her next book, she found a healthier relationship. ''I am in love with my dog,'' she wrote near the beginning of ''Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs'' (Dial Press, 1998).         ''I'm 38 and I'm single,'' she continued, ''and I'm having my most intense and gratifying relationship with a dog. But we all learn about love in different ways, and this way happens to be mine.''         ''Pack of Two'' was also a best-seller and, like ''Drinking,'' it commingled autobiography with nonfiction in its passages on dog rearing and pet-inspired self-analysis like ''I understand the impulse to romanticize the dog; I struggle with it myself.''         Ms. Knapp developed her style in her years as a columnist at The Boston Phoenix, an alternative weekly newspaper where she worked from 1988 to 1995 and to which she continued to contribute until 1999. Her ''Out There'' column, in which she often wrote about the travails in life and love of a semifictional 30-something single woman named Alice K. -- ''not her real initial'' -- was one of the paper's most popular features and won her an Alternative Newsweekly Award in 1996. She was often light and humorous in the paper, but could be poignantly confessional, as in a memorable column about her struggles with anorexia.         Her columns, were collected in 1994 in the book ''Alice K.'s Guide to Life: One Woman's Quest for Survival, Sanity and the Perfect New Shoes'' (Dutton/Plume).         Ms. Knapp graduated with honors from Brown University and worked as a reporter for The Boston Business Journal before joining at The Phoenix, where she was a features writer and later the lifestyle editor.         Her lung cancer was diagnosed in mid-April, and on May 11 she married Mark Morelli. She had recently completed work on a book about women's appetites.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Rebecca, of West Boylston, Mass.; and a brother, Andrew, of Salem, Mass.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills.

Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her.

She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, she was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Dorle Jarmel Soria, who was a co-founder of Angel Records in the course of her long and varied career in the classical music business, died on July 7 at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.         In 1953, Mrs. Soria and her husband, Dario, founded Angel Records as an American distribution outlet for some of the labels of the British company EMI.         In the four years that they operated Angel, before EMI sold it, they created a significant catalog of about 500 releases from some of the greatest musicians of the day, including the singers Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Tito Gobbi, Boris Christoff and the young Maria Callas; the pianists Walter Gieseking and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli; and the conductors Carlo Maria Giulini and Herbert von Karajan. Many recordings from this era remain available.         Born in 1900, Mrs. Soria graduated from Columbia University and had a career in journalism until Arthur Judson, the powerful concert manager, hired her. In addition to his own company, which later merged with Columbia Concerts, Judson was manager of the New York Philharmonic. In charge of publicity for all of his various endeavors, Mrs. Soria was involved with the Philharmonic at a significant time in its history, through Arturo Toscanini's European tour and Leonard Bernstein's debut.         In 1942, she married Mr. Soria, an Italian who had fled the Nazis. In 1953, she left Judson and the Philharmonic to join her husband in starting Angel Records. After their stint at Angel, the Sorias worked with Gian Carlo Menotti in establishing his Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, in 1958. They then began a new recording project, Soria Series, at RCA; Mr. Soria went on to become vice president of that label's international department. He later served as managing director of the Metropolitan Opera Guild.         In the 1960's, Mrs. Soria wrote a weekly column for the Carnegie Hall program. She went on to write regularly for the magazines High Fidelity, Musical America (where she wrote a monthly column called Artist Life) and Opera News. She also wrote a book about the history of the Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Soria died in 1980.         Mrs. Soria is survived by a nephew, Anthony Winner, of Charlottesville, Va.       
         Maritta M. Wolff, a novelist who burst onto the literary scene in 1941 with what Sinclair Lewis called ''the most important novel of the year'' and proceeded to write a string of vibrantly raw best sellers, died on July 1 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 83.         The novel, ''Whistle Stop,'' Ms. Wolff's first, became a movie of the same name starring George Raft and Ava Gardner. She wrote five more novels, then, without public explanation, stopped writing.         She married Leonard Stegman, who was in the costume jewelry business. She collected trinkets and bric-a-brac. For the final four decades of her life, her writing consisted of letters, many to fans who never tired of discussing the nuances of her plots and characters, Laura Stegman, her daughter-in-law, said.         It was not the destination that seemed likely when Ms. Wolff, at 22, wrote an 830-page story for a composition class at the University of Michigan and began her journey to the summits of the literary world. In 1940, the story won her the Avery Hopwood Prize, awarded along with $1,000 for excellent writing by University of Michigan students.         In 1941, the work appeared as ''Whistle Stop,'' trimmed to 450 pages and bubbling with gritty, robust dialogue. It surged through five printings and a miniaturized armed forces edition that so captivated soldiers and sailors that many sent fan letters. They particularly yearned to know the nature of the relationship between the sibling characters Kenny and Mary.         ''We in Barracks No. 2 have examined the situation from all angles -- and I do mean all angles -- and we can reach no satisfactory solution,'' a soldier wrote in 1945.         The answer was that what seemed to be incest was exactly that, but subtly portrayed. It was typical of Ms. Wolff's work: she pulled no punches, yet exhibited the gifted storyteller's delicate, essentially indescribable grasp of human nature.         Edith H. Walton wrote in her review of ''Whistle Stop'' in The New York Times Book Review: ''Because this is a very unusual book, and a strongly individual one, I am conscious that I have not really succeeded in conveying its flavor. That flavor is acrid, tangy, humorous, robust -- yet beneath all the humor there is a bitter and genuine emotion.''         Ms. Wolff's feel for the rhythms of speech -- developed in coffee shops and bars -- had much to do with the impact. A sample passage from her first novel:         ''Well, I gotta get dressed up all beautiful. Who knows, tonight, I might meet a great big beautiful man with a job and an automobile and he might take just one look at me and say, 'Baby, I'm nuts about you,' and I might just take one good look at him and say . . .''         Orville Prescott, in a 1942 review in The New York Times of ''Night Shift,'' Ms. Wolff's second book, called her feel for the American language phenomenal.         ''One feels certain that this is a scientifically exact record of the speech of factory workers in an automobile bumper plant, of taxi drivers, waitresses in cheap restaurants, beautiful dumb women and beautiful smart ones who haunt small-time night clubs,'' Mr. Prescott wrote.         Maritta Martin Wolff was born on Dec. 25, 1918, on a farm near Grass Lake, Mich., and grew up watching people, including those at the one-room country school she attended.         ''My one hobby was developing, as far back as I can remember, an inordinate interest in people and anything and everything happening to them,'' she wrote.         As soon as she learned penmanship, she began to write. Or, as she later put it, take dictation.         ''My characters have a habit of getting their own ideas,'' she told The Akron Beacon Journal in 1944. ''They tell me mine are goofy. They run away and do as they please.''         As did she. She refused to publicize her books, becoming more adamant as her career progressed and publishers demanded more of authors. Family lore says that was why she stopped writing.         At the University of Michigan, she met Hubert Skidmore, whom she married. Mr. Skidmore had written six novels by the time he was 30, including ''Hawk's Nest,'' about an industrial accident in West Virginia.         He died in a house fire in 1946. The next year, Ms. Wolff married Mr. Stegman, who survives her, as does their son, Hugh, of Los Angeles.         The reaction to ''Whistle Stop'' could hardly have been more enthusiastic, not least because of her searing language and hotter plots. A review by Clifton Fadiman in The New Yorker said, ''If she can write this way at 22, she should be good for a banning in Boston before she's 25.''         She wrote more books: ''About Lyddy Thomas'' (1947), ''Back of Town'' (1952), ''The Big Nickelodeon'' (1956) and ''Buttonwood'' (1962).         Then Ms. Wolff disappeared. Her writing seemed limited to correspondence and detailed records of repairs and oil changes for the silver Jaguar she loved to drive.         Her refrigerator has contained a complete, unpublished novel for years, her family said.       
         Dolores Olmedo Patiño, the combative Mexican art collector who turned her hacienda into a museum devoted to paintings by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, died in Mexico City on Saturday. Her age was a matter of debate, but she used a birth date that would make her 88.         Mrs. Olmedo amassed 137 works by Rivera and 25 by his wife, Kahlo, and for decades controlled the estates of these Mexican artists. Although Mrs. Olmedo eventually opened her collection to the public, she was denounced by her critics for delays in inaugurating the museum and for her reluctance for many years to give art experts and biographers ready access to the works and archives of Rivera and Kahlo.         But the diminutive Mrs. Olmedo, who once modeled for Diego Rivera, welcomed controversy as an opportunity to move from the margins of Mexican cultural history to center stage. Her stubbornness was vindicated when her Museo Dolores Olmedo Patiño, on the southern outskirts of Mexico City, was judged an artistic success.         Mrs. Olmedo loved flaunting her independence. Once asked how she would like to be remembered, she replied: ''Just as I am -- a woman who did whatever she felt like doing, and luckily succeeded at it.''         Born in Mexico City on Dec. 14, 1913, Dolores Olmedo was 17 when an encounter cast her destiny. She accompanied her mother, a schoolteacher, to the Ministry of Education, where they had a chance exchange in an elevator with Rivera, then a renowned artist in his 40's working on murals in the building.         ''He asked my mother if he could make some drawings of me,'' Mrs. Olmedo recalled. ''She agreed without knowing that I would pose nude.''         Rivera made 27 drawings of the young woman and gave them to her. Years later, her husband, Howard S. Phillips, an American publisher in Mexico, discovered them and ordered her to return them to Rivera. When Rivera was dying in the mid-1950's, Mrs. Olmedo, by then divorced and wealthy, put him up in her home and helped care for him. A grateful Rivera, whose reputation and earnings had tumbled, again gave her the nude drawings. He also sold her scores of his paintings and many works by Kahlo, who had died in 1954. Before his own death in 1957, Rivera designated Mrs. Olmedo to administer his and Kahlo's estates.         As the artists' reputations -- and the prices for their work -- rebounded, art critics and intellectuals began to resent Mrs. Olmedo's huge hoard of Riveras and Kahlos and her power over the artists' legacies. She was accused of having grossly underpaid for her collection. Stories swirled that a jealous Mrs. Olmedo was intent on sabotaging Kahlo's legacy.         ''I was never a friend of Frida Kahlo,'' Mrs. Olmedo conceded in an interview with The New York Times, in which she referred to the artist's bisexuality. ''Frida Kahlo liked women. I liked men.''         She said that she bought her 25 Kahlo paintings -- for which she paid only $1,600 -- because Rivera begged her to do so to make sure that an important part of his wife's work remained in Mexico under one roof. ''Otherwise I would not have done it,'' Mrs. Olmedo said.         Fewer than 200 Kahlo paintings survive, and Mrs. Olmedo's collection is the most significant private holding of her works.         Critics agreed that she owned some of the most highly regarded Kahlo paintings. Mrs. Olmedo ''has Kahlo's gritty, ferocious paintings -- the kind no one else could have painted,'' said Hayden Herrera, the author of ''Frida,'' a 1983 biography.         Mrs. Olmedo had little regard for Kahlo as an artist, and in several interviews referred to her works as ''trashy.'' Her estimation of Rivera, on the other hand, was uncritical. ''I will always defend his work energetically, while I'm alive and even after I die,'' she wrote in her museum's catalog.         Mrs. Olmedo's collection included dozens of little-known early works by Rivera done in post-Impressionist and Cubist styles. She also owned highly acclaimed paintings from Rivera's later period, including ''La Tehuana'' (1955), a portrait of Mrs. Olmedo wearing the colorful dress of a native of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; Kahlo often wore such a costume. But she also had many of his least memorable works, like saccharine portraits of Russian children that look like Soviet propaganda.         Mrs. Olmedo became the major collector of Riveras as well as Rivera's benefactor late in his life, thanks to her entrepreneurial acumen. After divorcing in the 1940's, she became one of the first Mexican women to succeed in real estate development. The business brought her into contact with leading industrialists and politicians, and fueled rumors, vigorously denied by Mrs. Olmedo, linking her romantically to several Mexican presidents.         Mrs. Olmedo was married and divorced three times. She is survived by four children from her first marriage, to Mr. Phillips. She also had 14 grandchildren.         In the early 1990's Mrs. Olmedo was accused of deliberately shutting down the Frida Kahlo Museum, also in Mexico City, for two years, under the guise of doing renovations in the building, once Kahlo's home. Mrs. Olmedo declined to explain the long museum closing. Friends suggested that the government was at fault for failing to cover the rather modest renovation costs as it was supposed to, but that Mrs. Olmedo refused to make any public statements that might hurt her political relationships or cast her as too stingy to foot the bill.         Similar reasons seem to have postponed the opening of Mrs. Olmedo's own museum for more than five years. In the mid-1980's she announced that with Mexican government backing she would convert her 16th-century Spanish colonial hacienda in Xochimilco, at the southern end of Mexico City, into a museum and then donate her collection for permanent display there.         During the renovations, the architects discovered that half the building was slowly sinking into its watery foundations and that the roof and walls were leaking.         Eventually, the government paid the renovation costs, and in late 1994 the museum opened. Even then many critics lambasted Mrs. Olmedo for displaying her collection according to her quirky tastes.         ''I lived with this art for most of my life,'' Mrs. Olmedo said. ''Who knows better than me how it should be displayed?''       
         Lillian Goldman, who made a major contribution to the reconstruction of the library at Yale Law School, in part because it was among the first law schools in America to admit women, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 80.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, the family said.         In 1992, Mrs. Goldman gave Yale University Law School what Guido Calabresi, then its dean, called ''probably the biggest gift in the history of American legal education'' -- more than $20 million, principally for the reconstruction and expansion of its library, which was renamed the Lillian Goldman Law Library.         Mrs. Goldman's gift was also used to endow a day care center at the law school, as well as for scholarships for underprivileged students, particularly women and those interested in the study of women's rights.         Mrs. Goldman's choice of Yale Law School reflected her friendship with Dean Calabresi, her interest in women's education and the school's early readiness to admit women and minority students when most other universities refused to accept them.         The first woman to graduate in law from Yale, Alice Jordan of Michigan, received her diploma in 1886 after the law faculty had defied the university's scandalized trustees by accepting her. It was not until 1918, however, that a formal policy of admitting women was established. Harvard Law School, by comparison, did not accept women until after World War II.         Lillian Schuman Goldman was born Jan. 17, 1922, in New York City. At 19, she married Sol Goldman, who had bought his first building at 17 and whom she urged to leave his family grocery business in Brooklyn and plunge full time into the world of New York real estate.         Mrs. Goldman played an active role in the real estate activities of her husband, who by his death in 1987 was one of the largest private landlords in New York City. But she also wrote poetry and was deeply committed to education. ''A book is a friend,'' she used to say.         After her husband's death, she turned her attention increasingly to philanthropy, creating the Lillian Goldman Charitable Trust to administer her gifts.         A meeting with Rita Hayworth, the film actress, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, led to a gift of about $1 million last year to the Alzheimer's Association, for medical research. After her son, Allan, developed Parkinson's disease, she became a supporter of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.         Both organizations presented her with awards in the last year in recognition of her help.         In 1998, she made a $5 million gift to the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan for the family center there, and a few weeks before her death, she gave $1 million for renovation of the Kane Street Synagogue in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.         In addition to her son, Allan, of New York City, Mrs. Goldman is survived by her daughters, Amy Goldman of Rhinebeck, N.Y., and Jane Goldman and Diane Kemper of New York City.       
         Edith Lutyens Bel Geddes, a costume designer for theater, ballet and film and a theatrical producer, died on Aug. 16 at her home in Hudson, N.Y. She was 95.         Known as Edith Lutyens for much of her professional career, she made and designed costumes for theater productions of ''The Crucible,'' ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Dear Me, the Sky Is Falling'' and ''The Deputy.''         She created costumes for stars like Katharine Cornell, in a 1947 production of ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' and for Orson Welles and his lavish 1946 stage production of ''Around the World in 80 Days.''         Ms. Lutyens had a costume shop in New York, where she helped create costumes for several Ballet Theater productions, among them Antony Tudor's ''Dim Luster'' and Jerome Robbins's ''Fancy Free,'' working with Motley, the British design team, and designers who included Kermit Love and Miles White. Her designs for ''The Clowns,'' choreographed in 1968 by Gerald Arpino, played an important role in establishing that ballet's fantastical atmosphere.         In a review in The New York Times, Clive Barnes described the costumes as having ''the white floppiness of Beardsley and the bedraggled poetry of Picasso saltimbanques.''         Ms. Lutyens was also a producer of the 1947 Broadway presentation of Gian Carlo Menotti's ''Medium'' and ''Telephone,'' working in partnership with the industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, her husband, and the producer Blevins Davis. She was also associated with the producer Cheryl Crawford and Eva Le Gallienne and her American Repertory Theater. Ms. Lutyens was also a costume consultant to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.         Her life offstage was at least as colorful as anything she designed or produced. Born in Brussels, Ms. Lutyens grew up in London, but then returned to Belgium and became a fencing champion.         During World War II she opened a dress shop in London, where she came to Motley's attention. In the United States she became a real estate broker while continuing her design business.         She was divorced from her first husband, Archibald Lutyens. Her marriages to Moseley Taylor and Bel Geddes ended with their deaths. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Emily Genauer, an art critic who championed 20th-century painting and sculpture over the course of a four-decade newspaper career and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, died on Friday after a long illness. She was 91.         Starting out as the critic for The New York World in the 1930's, Ms. Genauer made it her mission to introduce modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to a newspaper audience. She also staunchly defended art's independence from politics. In 1949, she left The New York World-Telegram after an argument with its owner, Roy W. Howard, who thought she was paying too much attention to artists he considered ''Communists and left-wingers,'' like Pablo Picasso.         Ms. Genauer's columns for The New York Herald Tribune, where she was chief art critic from 1949 to 1966, were also watched closely by artists. In 1992 she recalled how the painter Clyfford Still, about whom she had written unfavorably, sent her a pair of rubber baby pants with a card. The card read: ''Hoping this will aid in concealing your Sunday affliction. With the compliments of Clyfford Still.''         She tried to promote lesser-known artists. While visiting the East Side town house of John Hay Whitney, the owner of The Herald Tribune, she urged him to purchase more 20th-century art. She took him to a communal studio-gallery of avant-garde artists on the Bowery, directly opposite that neighborhood's leading flophouse. After getting out of his limousine and hesitantly stepping around some drunks, he bought a number of paintings.         The author of numerous books, Ms. Genauer was also a member of the National Council on the Humanities from 1966 to 1970.         Emily Genauer was born July 19, 1911, in Staten Island, where her father owned several delicatessens and was an amateur sculptor. She attended Hunter College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and began writing for The New York World in 1929. She always retained her maiden name as a byline, though after marrying Frederick Gash she took his last name in her private life.         The World paid her by the word, allowing her to make as much as $92 per week, she recalled in 1992. Then she got a call from an editor who told her she was to be paid a salary. ''Aren't you happy?'' the editor asked. ''You're now on staff. Your fee will be $35 a week.''         After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life, and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York City; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''       
         Emily Genauer, an art critic who championed 20th-century painting and sculpture over the course of a four-decade newspaper career and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, died on Friday after a long illness. She was 91.         Starting out as the critic for The New York World in the 1930's, Ms. Genauer made it her mission to introduce modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to a newspaper audience. She also staunchly defended art's independence from politics. In 1949, she left The New York World-Telegram after an argument with its owner, Roy W. Howard, who thought she was paying too much attention to artists he considered ''Communists and left-wingers,'' like Pablo Picasso.         Ms. Genauer's columns for The New York Herald Tribune, where she was chief art critic from 1949 to 1966, were also watched closely by artists. In 1992 she recalled how the painter Clyfford Still, about whom she had written unfavorably, sent her a pair of rubber baby pants with a card. The card read: ''Hoping this will aid in concealing your Sunday affliction. With the compliments of Clyfford Still.''         She tried to promote lesser-known artists. While visiting the East Side town house of John Hay Whitney, the owner of The Herald Tribune, she urged him to purchase more 20th-century art. She took him to a communal studio-gallery of avant-garde artists on the Bowery, directly opposite that neighborhood's leading flophouse. After getting out of his limousine and hesitantly stepping around some drunks, he bought a number of paintings.         The author of numerous books, Ms. Genauer was also a member of the National Council on the Humanities from 1966 to 1970.         Emily Genauer was born July 19, 1911, in Staten Island, where her father owned several delicatessens and was an amateur sculptor. She attended Hunter College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and began writing for The New York World in 1929. She always retained her maiden name as a byline, though after marrying Frederick Gash she took his last name in her private life.         The World paid her by the word, allowing her to make as much as $92 per week, she recalled in 1992. Then she got a call from an editor who told her she was to be paid a salary. ''Aren't you happy?'' the editor asked. ''You're now on staff. Your fee will be $35 a week.''         After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''       
         Doris Wishman, a prolific independent director of truly tasteless movies -- from nudist camp romps to the cult classic ''Bad Girls Go to Hell'' -- died on Aug. 10 in Miami. She lived in Coral Gables, Fla.         She never revealed her age, but her passport carried a date of birth of April 23, 1920, making her 82, said Michael Bowen, who is writing her biography. He said family members believe she was around 90.         Miss Wishman has been called the female Ed Wood, the legendary director of ''B'' movies. She wrote, produced, cast, directed and edited around 30 films, including several she made under pseudonyms. She rarely spent more than $70,000 on a picture, usually beginning by begging her sister Pearl Kushner, who also lives in Coral Gables and is her only immediate survivor, for startup money.         Joe Bob Briggs, the drive-in movie critic, called her ''the greatest female exploitation director in history.''         She often said she did not like her movies, but she clearly enjoyed making them. The title of Mr. Bowen's biography is ''It's Better Than Sex,'' a phrase she often applied to filmmaking. Her work, which had faded from view in the 1980's, made a resurgence after being featured at the Harvard University Film Archive in 1994.         She was born in Manhattan, and her mother died when she was a young child. Her father, who sold hay and grain, and his six children then moved to Westchester County. Miss Wishman took some courses at Hunter College and studied acting.         She took a job as a secretary and movie booker in a relative's film distribution business. She married an advertising executive, Jack Abrahms, and moved to Florida; he died a few years later.         In her grief she wanted work that would occupy all of her waking time. She decided she could produce independent films as well as distribute them, and hit upon the idea of making films about nudist camps. Recent court rulings had removed them from censorship.         She made a total of eight, including ''Blaze Starr Goes Nudist,'' the only feature film starring the burlesque queen (as herself).         ''Nude on the Moon,'' in which astronauts are greeted by naked women with pipe-cleaner antennas poking out of their bouffant hairdos, was banned in New York State. The censor board at the time allowed only films about nudist colonies, turning aside her argument that it was about a nudist camp on the moon.         In her next phase, she made sexual melodramas in which women were depicted as tragic heroines being exploited by men. There was nudity and plenty of violence against women but no explicit sex. In the grainy black-and-white pictures, which included titles like ''A Taste of Flesh,'' she defined a quirky personal style: bizarre cutaways to ashtrays, lamps and squirrels; suggestive lesbian subplots and gratuitous nudity and violence.         By the early 1970's, court decisions allowed and audiences demanded more explicit pornographic films. She made several, but left the room when sex scenes were being shot.         ''She was actually rather sexually naïve,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''She personally thought someone's hand caressing your face was more erotic than sex itself.''         Her big successes in the 1970's were two films starring Chesty Morgan, named for her commanding physical endowments. The movies had scant sex and very little nudity.         Miss Wishman wanted to make ''slasher'' films like ''Friday the 13th,'' but she lacked the money and technical skills. But in 1989, ''A Night to Dismember'' was finally released.         She had moved back to New York after the death of her husband and married again in 1966, a man she referred to only as Lou in interviews. The marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970's.         She moved back to Florida in the late 1980's and was working in a lingerie store when interest in her work, which was readily available on video, began its resurgence. Her last movie, ''Each Time I Kill,'' will probably be released later this year, Mr. Bowen said.         He said that despite the raciness of her films she herself claimed little sexual experience.         ''I've had two husbands and a lover, and that's my quota,'' she said.       
         Mollie Wilmot, the socialite with the oversize white sunglasses who rose to celebrity in 1984 when a tanker ran aground at her Palm Beach, Fla., mansion, died on Sept. 17 at her apartment in Manhattan.         She was always reluctant to give her age, and ages from 73 to 78 have been reported. The Times Union of Albany, which regularly noted her attendance -- and choice of jewels -- at horse races in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said longtime friends estimated that she was in her early 80's.         Paul Wilmot, a former husband, guessed 73 was closer. At least that is what she told him.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Mrs. Wilmot had no children, and her sole immediate survivor is her sister, Francice Bushkin, of Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Wilmot rose to prominence the day after Thanksgiving in 1984, when a maid awakened her. Madame had callers to her one-acre oceanfront estate, next door to the estate of Rose Kennedy on North Ocean Boulevard Drive.         ''I thought it was the man who was coming to photograph my home for Town and Country,'' she said in an interview in The New York Times.         Instead, in a town that reveres privacy, it was visitors who arrived unannounced -- something frequent visitors like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor just would not do.         ''Let's have coffee first,'' Mrs. Wilmot said with a sigh.         She finally padded out to the patio in her dressing gown to find a 197-foot Venezuelan freighter pounding her seawall into concrete chips. A freak tropical storm had driven the ship, a rust bucket named the Mercedes, hard against her wall.         She overcame her dread of escaping Venezuelan rats and served finger sandwiches, caviar and coffee to the crew of 10, and martinis to the journalists who showed up.         She also fed the ship's cat, which the crew later gave to her. The cat, by then known as Mollie Mercedes, was passed on to her neighbors, the Pulitzer family, who sent it to the beauty parlor for a thorough fluffing and then outfitted it in velvet collars decorated with gold.         Such trappings were typical of the Palm Beach way of life that Mrs. Wilmot had known since she bought her mansion in the early 1960's. She brought her touch to the house, covering the walls of the grand drawing room with leopard-print fabric and laying the skins of lions and zebras on the gleaming floors. She displayed oceans of flowers, always white. Her own elegant, sometimes ostentatious, costumes also had a decidedly personal signature, particularly those sunglasses.         Soon after her purchase, Mrs. Wilmot was forced to put up with Secret Service agents who overran her property to protect her neighbor, President John F. Kennedy. The agents were less of a bother than a large boat in the backyard. But still.         Mollie Netcher was born in Chicago. She was named after her grandmother, who began as a clerk and underwear buyer in the family store and became known as ''the merchant princess of State Street.'' Her parents, Charles and Gladys, inherited the business, the Boston Store.         Mrs. Wilmot graduated from the Foxcroft School. She was married to and divorced from Eddie Bragno, a wine merchant who is now dead; Albert Bostwick, of the polo family; and Mr. Wilmot, a fashion publicity agent.         She exuberantly moved from charities, particularly ones related to dancing and horses, to art auctions. Her philanthropy included the New York City Ballet, the National Museum of Racing, the National Museum of Dance and equine research at the Veterinary College of Cornell University.         Her most dramatic moment occurred when the ramshackle freighter visited her. Helicopters carrying cameramen buzzed overhead for months, after it turned out that the ship's owner was bankrupt and it was stuck.         Palm Beach residents became nightly visitors, sipping cocktails and offering tongue-in-cheek suggestions on what Mrs. Wilmot might do about her problem. A bar had Mollie Wilmot look-alike contests, and many customers wore blond wigs and large white-framed sunglasses. Mrs. Wilmot judged.         After she had waited more than a month for the Mercedes to be removed, which turned out to be just a third of its stay, Mrs. Wilmot was convinced of one thing.         ''There's a strong possibility,'' she said, ''that if the boat had washed up on the Kennedy property, it would be gone already.''         If it all sounded like a movie, that is exactly what the Walt Disney Company thought. For 10 years, it tried to make a film, ''Palm Beached,'' that was supposed to star Melanie Griffith or Bette Midler. It languished in development and died.         Mrs. Wilmot came out strongly against having Ms. Midler portray her. The actress had just appeared in ''Down and Out in Beverly Hills.''         ''Disney wants to be flamboyant, to turn Palm Beach into a Beverly Hills,'' Mrs. Wilmot said. ''And I don't think that's fair.''       
         Representative Patsy T. Mink, a liberal Democrat from Hawaii who was likely to be elected to a 13th term in November, died Saturday at the Straub Clinic and Hospital in Honolulu. She was 74.         The cause was viral pneumonia brought on by chickenpox, said Andy Winer, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Hawaii.         As a member of Congress from 1965 until 1977, and again from 1990 until her death, Ms. Mink was a champion of women's rights, education, civil rights and labor unions.         One of her primary legislative achievements came in 1972, when she was one of the sponsors of Title IX of the federal Education Amendments, which mandates equal financing for women's athletics and academics at institutions receiving federal money.         ''It's rare as a legislator that you fight for legislation you believe in and stay around or live long enough to see it come to fruition,'' Ms. Mink said in 1995, in a meeting with some of the nation's top female basketball players.         Ms. Mink was known as articulate and strong-willed, and willing to fight for causes large and small.         In 1967, she and two other congresswomen tried to get into the House gym, after hearing about a form letter inviting members to use what was at the time an exclusively male preserve. They were turned away by the gym's director, who news reports said was ''horrified'' by their transgression.         Several years later, she took on Dr. Edgar F. Berman, a member of the Democratic Party's committee on national priorities, who claimed that women's ''raging hormonal imbalance'' made them unfit for executive positions in business and politics. Dr. Berman eventually resigned from the committee.         Ms. Mink, however, stopped short of associating herself with the women's liberation movement.         ''Just because I'm interested in women doesn't mean I'm for women's liberation,'' she told The New York Times in 1970. ''I support all groups when what they do coincides with what I believe in.''         Patsy Takemoto was born in Paia, a sugar plantation town on the island of Maui, on Dec. 6, 1927. As a senior at Maui High School she was elected student body president, and by the time she graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1948, her interests had shifted from medicine to the humanities.         In 1951, she graduated from the University of Chicago Law School. That same year, she married John F. Mink, a doctoral student in geology. The couple moved to Honolulu, where Ms. Mink opened a law office and became the first Japanese-American woman licensed to practice law in Hawaii, Mr. Winer said.         In 1956, Ms. Mink was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Legislature. In 1958, she was elected to the Hawaii Senate.         In her first period in Congress, Ms. Mink was an early critic of the Vietnam War, prompting some opponents to call her Patsy Pink.         In 1972 she and Representative Bella S. Abzug of New York traveled to Paris, where they met with North Vietnamese officials to discuss the prospects for peace.         In 1967, in a speech before the House of Representatives, Ms. Mink argued against harsh punishments for people who burned the American flag.         ''America is not a country which needs to punish its dissenters to preserve its honor,'' she said. ''America is not a country which needs to demand conformity of all its people, for its strength lies in all our diversities converging in one common belief, that of the importance of freedom as the essence of our country.''         In 1976, after 12 years in Congress, Ms. Mink sought a seat in the United States Senate. She lost the Democratic primary to Spark M. Matsunaga. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed her assistant secretary of state for oceans and international, environmental and scientific affairs.         Ms. Mink returned to Congress in 1990 after winning a special election for the seat vacated by Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, who was appointed to the Senate after Mr. Matsunaga's death. She discovered that many of her fellow Democrats had shifted toward more centrist positions.         ''She saw it as an opportunity to teach lessons,'' said Representative Neil Abercrombie, Democrat of Hawaii. ''She never thought for a moment of not working with people who didn't agree with her ideologically.''         In her final term, Ms. Mink raised questions about the creation of the Homeland Security Department, saying she feared that the new legislation could be used to undermine civil rights.         ''She had already been through that as a Japanese-American, seeing people put into detention camps on the basis of what they supposedly were as opposed to what they had actually done,'' Mr. Abercrombie said.         Ms. Mink is survived by her husband; their daughter, Gwendolyn; and a brother, Eugene Takemoto.       
         Kim Hunter, whose eclectic 60-year career included an Oscar, two Emmy nominations and a Broadway triumph with her portrayal of Stella in the legendary 1947 debut of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died on Wednesday at her New York apartment. She was 79.         A founding member of the Actors Studio whose screen career was temporarily derailed by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950's, Ms. Hunter was recently hospitalized for a fall and had been in declining health. She died of a heart attack in her apartment above the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.         Ms. Hunter caught the acting bug in elementary school and was never a snob about the roles she chose, mixing highly demanding parts with smaller ones in B-movies, long stints in regional theater, television guest appearance and even a running role on an ABC soap opera, ''The Edge of Night,'' in 1979 and 1980.         But without doubt the roles for which she is most remembered are Stella Kowalski, Marlon Brando's passionate and beleaguered wife in the stage and film versions of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' and Dr. Zira, the coquettish simian with a fondness for Charlton Heston in the 1968 film ''Planet of the Apes.''         The role of Stella also won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress when the director Elia Kazan adapted his Broadway production to the screen. The scenes of an anguished Stanley Kowalski (Mr. Brando), disheveled and grimy, screaming up to his wife -- ''Stella!'' -- in the backyard of their seedy New Orleans home, and of Ms. Hunter's sexually charged descent on a winding staircase into his arms, have become iconic cinematic moments.         Feisty, occasionally profane, Ms. Hunter frequently told interviewers that she had no use for the trappings of Hollywood stardom that had always eluded her.         ''The work itself has been my life,'' she said in 1999. ''I was never in this for jazzy stardom, and as far as that's concerned, I've never had it. Doesn't matter to me.''         Ms. Hunter was born in Detroit, and her father died four years later. Her mother and stepfather moved the family to Miami Beach when she was 10, and there she developed a taste for the theater.         ''I was lonely growing up,'' she said. ''My only brother was nine years older and had little time for me. So I picked friends out of books and played let's-pretend games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''         Before long she had an acting coach and made her stage debut at 17 in the title role of ''Penny Wise'' at the Miami Women's Club. Later she took roles with stock companies around the country. At the Pasadena Playhouse in California, in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract with the producer David O. Selznick.         For her 1943 screen debut, Selznick loaned her to the horror-film producer Val Lewton, for whom she played a young woman battling devil worshipers in ''The Seventh Victim.''         Shortly afterward, Ms. Hunter took a supporting role in the Ginger Rogers film ''Tender Comrade,'' about young women living communally during World War II, a film that struck some as pro-Soviet. It was cited, years later, as a reason that her name appeared in ''Red Channels,'' a 1950's pamphlet naming suspected Communist sympathizers.         Ms. Hunter, a liberal Democrat, had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, though she never belonged to the Communist Party. She said she traced her problems with the blacklist to a world peace symposium that she helped sponsor in 1949. No one ever announced that she was on a blacklist, she said.         ''Gradually it became sort of clear,'' she said. ''I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then, finally, it was NBC. And then by that time, I won my Oscar for the movie of 'Streetcar,' but I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.''         Her hiatus from the screen lasted until 1956, when she appeared opposite Bette Davis in ''Storm Center,'' about book-burning. ''I thought, uh-oh, here we go again,'' she said. But her political problems did not reignite.         Ms. Hunter was one of the few forgiving voices when many in Hollywood rebelled against awarding Mr. Kazan a special Oscar in 1999. He had never apologized for naming names to Congressional investigators during the blacklist days.         ''The whole business is dumb,'' she told one interviewer. ''Artistic achievement and the mistake someone made years ago don't belong together.''         The ''Streetcar'' role came about because Selznick's wife Irene remembered the actress when it came time to cast the role of Stella. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, but rehearsals were held on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater.         ''Tennessee sat way in the back and when he had a thought about something, he'd write a note and come down to where we were working, reach over and tuck the note into Kazan's coat pocket,'' Ms. Hunter said.         Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the entire cast. ''All act not only with color and style, but with insight,'' he wrote.         Ms. Hunter's 1944 marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. The couple had one child, Kathryn, now of Stamford, Conn., who took the name of Ms. Hunter's second husband, Robert Emmett. Emmett, also an actor, died in 2000. The couple had a son, Sean Robert, also of Stamford, and Ms. Hunter is survived by six grandchildren.         As for her other most celebrated role, Ms. Hunter said ''Planet of the Apes'' was a project she respected. ''I thought it was a damned interesting script and a challenge for all of us,'' she said.         She spent hours at the Bronx Zoo, she said, studying primate behavior. But the project turned out to be more of a challenge than she had anticipated, largely because of the cumbersome makeup. ''The only part of me uncovered was my eyeballs,'' she said. ''I had to breathe through my upper lip. It was wild.''         Ms. Hunter also appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1952 drama ''Deadline USA,'' and drew critical praise in ''Lilith'' (1964) and ''The Swimmer'' (1968), among other roles. More recently, she had a small role in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         ''Acting is my life,'' she said in 1994. ''It doesn't get easier. It gets harder. I find it more challenging as I do it and realize how much more has to go into it. But I thank God I am in a profession where there is no retirement age.''       
         Lolita Torres, a leading actress and singer from Argentina who became an international symbol of that nation's golden age of moviemaking in the 1950's, died on Saturday in Buenos Aires. She was 72.         The cause was a lung infection related to a chronic rheumatoid condition, the Spanish news agency EFE reported.         Born Beatriz Mariana Torres in 1930 in Avellana, a city near the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, she began her career at age 11 singing folk songs from Spain at the popular Avenida Theater in Buenos Aires.         A granddaughter of immigrants to Argentina from the Spanish regions of Navarre and Galicia, Ms. Torres easily mastered singing with an accent from Spain. That ability caught the attention of Manolo Paredes, a prominent Spanish actor, and Ramón Zarzoso, the flamenco maestro, both of whom helped her early in her show business career.         She began acting in 1944 with a small role in ''The Dance of Fortune,'' a movie directed by Luis Bayón Herrera about the marital ambitions of the nouveau riche. By the early 1950's, she had gained renown, particularly for her roles in musical comedies, several of them conceived by the screenwriter Abel Santa Cruz.         In these roles Ms. Torres, who rarely allowed herself to be kissed onscreen, conveyed a traditional yet independent image that was new to moviemaking in Argentina and elsewhere.         ''Smooth, sweet, and at the same time energetic, aspiring to emancipation,'' was how the newspaper La Nación described her appeal to young female viewers.         Ms. Torres was popular outside Argentina, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union, where she was lauded during the 1950's as a symbol of enterprising youth. ''The Age of Love,'' about the frustrated loves of a famous singer and a millionaire, directed by Julio Saraceni in 1954, was perhaps her biggest movie hit abroad.         Ms. Torres acted in 17 films before retiring as an actress in 1972. After recording hits like ''Gitano Jesus,'' or ''Gypsy Jesus,'' she continued her singing career, touring several other nations in Latin America, Spain and the former Soviet Union.         Her first husband, Santiago Rodolfo Burastero, died in 1959 after a car accident near Mar del Plata, Argentina.         Her second husband, Julio Caccia, suffered a heart attack at her burial ceremony Sunday at the Argentine Actors' Association mausoleum in Buenos Aires and was admitted to the hospital, news reports said. She is also survived by five children, Santiago, Angélica, Marcelo, Mariana and Diego, an internationally known pop star.       
         Vera G. List, a forward-looking philanthropist whose causes included contemporary art, opera, education and social justice, died Thursday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 94.         Mrs. List, who received the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1996, was born Vera Glaser in 1908 in Brookline, Mass., the daughter of a housepainter from Latvia. She credited her interest in art and music to her mother, who despite an often constrained budget maintained a beautifully decorated house.         She attended Simmons College, and in 1930 married Albert A. List, from Fall River, Mass., who made his family's grocery the basis of a business empire that eventually included RKO Theaters.         Mrs. List began collecting art almost immediately. As her husband's wealth grew, her art purchases and their philanthropy kept pace. The saying in the family was that ''the money was his, the ideas were hers,'' her daughters said.         The Lists' beneficiaries included the Metropolitan Opera, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Jewish Museum and the New School for Social Research, now New School University. They built art centers at M.I.T., Brown University and Swarthmore College, and endowed professorships at various universities and medical schools.         Mrs. List endowed art-lending programs (and provided them with prints) for students at the New School and M.I.T. Another endowment enabled New School students to attend the Metropolitan Opera for $5.         The Albert A. List Foundation, formed in the 1950's, donated money to the construction of Lincoln Center. The foundation also paid for much of the center's art, including the large two-piece sculpture by Henry Moore that dominates its reflecting pool.         Mrs. List was particularly proud of the List Art Posters program at Lincoln Center, which invited contemporary artists to design posters for cultural events.         Mrs. List also became an avid collector of modern and contemporary art, especially sculpture. The List family's sculpture collection included works by artists from Giacometti to Joel Shapiro and a full-length portrait of Mrs. List by George Segal.         Mrs. List was on the boards of the Jewish Museum and the American Federation of Arts. But she may be best known in the art world for helping Marcia Tucker, a former curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, establish the New Museum of Contemporary Art, now in SoHo. It opened in 1977 in the Albert A. List Building at the New School on Fifth Avenue and 14th Street.         Although the Lists gave art to several New York museums, after her husband's death in 1987, Mrs. List sold much of her collection to have more money to give away. In her last years she supported programs with missions like reducing hate crimes or the birth rate. She liked to remember people by endowing lecture programs, like the one named for Barbara Jordan at the New School, or providing fellowships, like one for New School students from Poland, named for Katarzyna Kalwinska, a Polish Catholic who hid Jews who had escaped from concentration camps.         She is survived by three daughters, Olga Mack of New York City, Carol Schwartz of Denver, and Viki List, of Rosemont, Pa.; 11 grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren. One daughter, Jo Levinson, died last year.       
         Harriet Doerr, who at 73 published her first novel, unveiling an exquisite gift to marshal clear, sparse prose to evoke, in her phrase, memories ''like a gentle knife stuck into your heart,'' died on Sunday at her home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 92.         She had been in declining health since she suffered a broken hip in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha Doerr Toppin. In recent years, glaucoma and frailty kept her from writing, even at her methodical pace of a sentence or so an hour.         Ms. Doerr's gleaming literary reputation rested on three slender books, perhaps 600 pages in all.         Her first book, ''Stones for Ibarra'' (Viking, 1984), which won the American Book Award for first fiction, was called ''a perfect book'' by the writer Alice Adams, and her next novel and a book of short stories elicited similar praise.         Her style roamed the geography of Mexico, memory and mood in a manner that the critic Anatole Broyard in The New York Times said carried ''echoes of Gabriel García Márquez, Katherine Anne Porter and even Graham Greene.'' Her gift for phrasing was suggested by her description of the Mexican village as ''no more than a shard chipped from the rock face of eternity.'' Elsewhere she called it ''a town of a hundred burros.''         Her critics generally agreed that she improved with age, and emphasized that her works would have been remarkable for a writer of any age.         In reviewing her second novel, ''Consider This, Señora'' (Harcourt, 1993), published in 1993, when she was 83, the critic Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, ''Everything is richer, as when an actress takes a role you saw her play a decade ago, and lets you read that decade in her face, her voice and her body.''         Harriet Green Huntington was born in Pasadena on April 8, 1910, the third of six children and two step-children. Her grandfather was Henry Edwards Huntington, and she played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. She grew up with nannies and servants, as well as more intangible blessings: her family loved reading and lively discussions, her daughter said.         Ms. Doerr was asked to read several of her poems at high school graduation, but would not allow the school to reproduce them because she thought they were awful. When she was 16, she met Albert Doerr, an engineering student at Stanford University who took her to a prize fight on their first date. She was horrified, not least because of the droplets of blood that had spattered on her dress.         She went east to Smith College in 1927 with her train compartment filled with roses from Mr. Doerr. She did not like the cold of Massachusetts and felt homesick and ''half in love.'' By the summer of 1928, she left Smith and transferred to Stanford. where Mr. Doerr was finishing his degree. They married in 1930, and she left college.         They had two children; the first, a son, Michael, died of cancer in 1995. Ms. Toppin, the second child and Ms. Doerr's only survivor, lives in Oakland.         In World War II, while her husband served in the Navy, she and he signed petitions protesting the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps.         The family went to Mexico in the late 1950's. There Mr. Doerr oversaw the revival of his family's mining business. Much of the emotional quality of that experience is contained in Ms. Doerr's first novel, including the male protagonist's struggle with leukemia. Mr. Doerr died of leukemia in 1972.         Her son teased Ms. Doerr into returning to college in 1975. She first took some classes at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., and then enrolled full time at Stanford, majoring in history. She was accepted into the university's prestigious creative-writing program. Other students resented her presence, until she read her first piece aloud.         Ms. Doerr won the $2,500 Transatlantic Review-Henfield Foundation Award in 1982, based on three stories she had published in small literary magazines. Senior editors at Viking Penguin suggested her stories could be combined into a novel. She and a professor shuffled them on her living room floor until a larger narrative fell into place.         Her next novel, ''Consider This, Señora,'' was also set in Mexico and was seen by some critics as imitative. But Laura Cumming, writing in The Guardian of London, said it was ''full of enchanted fables.''         ''The Tiger in the Grass'' (Viking, 1995) was a collection of essays, many about Mexico. But words of searing pain reflected a more immediate concern: her son was then dying of cancer, and Ms. Doerr used italicized passages to tell his story. In one, she remembered that his first word was ''car'' and that the doctor had just forbidden him to drive.         ''Now his car is parked outside his house and is visible from several windows,'' she wrote. ''I have forgotten the details of Chinese water torture we used to hear of, but it must be something like this.''         Ms. Doerr believed in no religion, but often took solace in each person's ability to create memories that live on. In ''Consider This, Señora,'' the character Ursula Bowles, a widow who enters the story at age 79 and exits at 83, witnesses life's evanescence.         ''She could see that an individual life is, in the end, nothing more than a stirring of air, a shifting of light,'' Ms. Doerr wrote. ''No one of us, finally, can be more than that. Even Einstein. Even Brahms.         ''Then the widow slept.''       
         Vinnette Carroll, the trailblazing actress, director and playwright who was the first African-American woman to direct a production on Broadway, died Tuesday at her home in Fort Lauderhill, Fla. She was 80.         The cause was complications from diabetes and heart disease, said Anita MacShane, a friend.         A black woman in a business often dominated by white men, Ms. Carroll's career included several theatrical milestones and a consistent sense of activity and ambition.         As a director, she was not only the first black woman to direct on Broadway -- the musical revue ''Don't Bother Me I Can't Cope,'' in 1972 -- but she also brought her best-known show, the gospel-infused ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' to Broadway on three separate occasions. As an actress, Ms. Carroll won an Emmy (''Beyond the Blues,'' in 1964), an Obie (''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl,'' in 1962) and was nominated for three Tony awards.         Ms. Carroll was also the founder and artistic director of the Urban Arts Corps, a New York-based training and producing organization devoted to supporting black and Hispanic theater and actors. The group fostered the careers of hundreds of performers, including Cicely Tyson and Sherman Hemsley, as well as presenting ''Don't Bother Me'' and ''Your Arms Too Short.'' The onetime director of the New York State Ghetto Arts Program, which brought theater and dance to poor neighborhoods, Ms. Carroll also worked in Los Angeles at the Inner City Repertory in the Watts district, presenting classical and modern works.         Born into a well-off Jamaican family, Ms. Carroll moved to Harlem when she was 10 and found an instant affinity for the arts, playing viola with the Dean Dixon Symphony when in high school. Her father, however, who was a dentist, had medical plans for her. After graduating from Long Island University, Ms. Carroll received a master's degree in psychology from New York University and worked briefly as a clinical psychologist in the New York City schools.         At the same time, though, she was moonlighting in acting classes; drama soon won her over. In 1948, she was accepted to the Erwin Pescator dramatic workshop at the New School, where she studied with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.         A tall woman with with round cheeks and a high brow, Ms. Carroll was not classified as beautiful in the traditional sense, but still she impressed her teachers with her expressive eyes and resonant voice.         After honing her craft by acting at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., Ms. Carroll found some work in the theater in the 1950's, and also toured extensively with a one-woman show that she wrote. Her Broadway debut came in a short-lived revival of ''A Small War on Murray Hill,'' open for a single week in January 1957.         It was during the 1960's and 70's, the height the national black theater movement, that Ms. Carroll's talents came into full bloom.         In 1962, she won her Obie in ''Moon Over a Rainbow Shawl'' Off Broadway, stealing scenes from her castmate James Earl Jones. A year later, ''Trumpets of the Lord,'' Ms. Carroll's musical adaptation of seven sermons, became a runaway Off Broadway hit. In 1964, she won her Emmy. In 1966, she garnered more praise for directing and starring in the Langston Hughes play ''Prodigal Son,'' a production that toured Europe.         In 1967, she founded the Urban Arts Corps, which produced dozens of shows out of a space on West 20th Street. In 1969, another production of ''Trumpets of the Lord'' opened on Broadway, but closed in less than a week.         Ms. Carroll more than made up for the brevity of that run with two enormous success during the 1970's. The first was ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' a roof-raising gospel revue with songs by Micki Grant, which Ms. Carroll conceived, produced and directed at the Urban Arts Corps in 1970 and later took to Broadway, where it ran for 1,065 performances. Ms. Carroll's direction was nominated for a Tony, making her the first black woman ever to win that nomination. (She lost to Bob Fosse for ''Pippin.'')         Shortly after ''I Can't Cope'' closed, in 1974, Ms. Carroll began conceiving a followup, a gospel celebration of the Gospel of St. Matthew. That show, ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' with music and lyrics by Alex Bradford and Micki Grant, turned out to be a big success, spawning several national tours and two return trips to Broadway, including a 1982 version starred Patti LaBelle and Al Green. A fourth trip to Broadway is being planned for next year.         Not all of Ms. Carroll's efforts were as successful. A pricey adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' titled ''But Never Jam Today,'' had a tortured route to Broadway, only to close within a week, in 1979.         Ms. Carroll divided her time between New York and Florida, where she bought a house in the 1980's. She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Carroll Hudgins, of Manhattan.         In the late 1980's, she founded a theater in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., devoted to featuring work by minority playwrights and actors. Throughout her life, Ms. Carroll was an eloquent speaker about the challenges of being black and female.         ''I have had a great deal of hurt in the theater both as a Negro and as a woman, but I don't get immobilized by it,'' she said an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1967. ''I tell myself that no one individual is going to make it impossible for me.''       
         Ellen Straus, a passionate environmentalist and co-owner of the first organic dairy farm west of the Mississippi River, died on Saturday at her home in Marshall, Calif., north of San Francisco. She was 75.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         A pioneer in the purchase of development rights from farmers to save the land from being turned into tract housing and shopping malls, Ms. Straus was a founder of the Marin Agricultural Land Trust in 1980. But she is probably best known outside the Bay Area for the rich, thick milk produced on the family farm, which her son Albert turned into high-quality cheese, yogurt and butter at the Straus Family Creamery.         Ellen Tirza Lotte Prins was born on Feb. 21, 1927, in Amsterdam. Her family fled the country just ahead of the Nazi invasion in 1940. She graduated from Bard College in New York in 1948, but instead of fulfilling her dream of studying medicine, she married William Straus, a German Jewish immigrant 12 years her senior, who had come to study agriculture at the University of California.         It took him only 16 days to persuade her to abandon further studies and move to what was then a small farm on the shores of Tomales Bay in Marin County, Calif. There they brought up four children, Albert, Vivien, Miriam and Michael, who survive her, along with her husband, four grandsons and a sister, Anneke Prins Simons of Jersey City.         Inspired by Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring,'' Ms. Straus turned her attention to the environmental movement when she learned of plans to build hundreds of homes along the Marin County coast as well as a resort at Tomales Bay. She was instrumental in the creation of the Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, preserving 17 ranches. Along with other environmentalists, she persuaded the county supervisors to pass strict zoning laws.         But just to make certain the restrictions could not be changed she helped found the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, or MALT, which now has 47 ranches and dairies covering 32,000 acres. It represents 30 percent of the private farmland in Marin County, and the owners have granted easements saying it must remain agricultural land. Ms. Straus served on its board until 1990 and was its chairwoman from 1999 to 2001.         Today there are 1,000 land trusts throughout the country, and the trust was the model for scores of them.         The Straus family used the money it received for its own conservation easement to convert its farm into an organic operation, a move that saved it from the unprofitable co-op milk market and made it possible for the Strauses to stay in business by selling more profitable products.         Those products, unhomogenized milk with a thick layer of cream on the top, bottled in glass; cream that almost whips itself; and Monterey Jack and white cheddar, are sold throughout California. The farm's Holstein cows also produce all the milk used by the acclaimed Cow Girl Creamery of Point Reyes, for crème fraîche, fromage blanc and Mount Tam triple cream cheese.         Ms. Straus was a hands-on farmer. On the first night of the farm's organic operation, she individually stamped the expiration dates on glass milk bottles as they rolled off the conveyor. Three or four times a year, she led educational tours of the dairy for the agricultural land trust, preparing the lunch for the 50 or so people who attended.         In 1998, the American Farmland Trust in Washington, D.C., presented Ms. Straus with the annual Steward of the Land Award in recognition of her lifelong struggle for family farms. The White House made her a Points of Light winner in 2001 for her lifetime of volunteer work.         When she was honored by the American Farmland Trust, Ms. Straus said World War II had taught her a lifelong lesson about standing for one's beliefs: ''That we, as individuals, are responsible for what is happening in our communities, and that we must become activists.''
