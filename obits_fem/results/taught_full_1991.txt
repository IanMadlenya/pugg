         Judith Leibowitz, a teacher at the Juilliard School of Music, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         She died of cancer, her twin sister, Pearl Ausubel of Manhattan, said.         Mrs. Leibowitz joined the Juilliard faculty at the invitation of John Houseman in 1968. She taught the Alexander Technique in the new drama division, a required course for all Juilliard students. The Alexander Technique is a means of improving and correcting body movement, and Ms. Leibowitz's students included the actors Kevin Kline, Robin Williams and Kelly McGillis.         In 1964 she helped found the American Center for the Alexander Technique in Manhattan to train and certify teachers. She was director of the program until 1981 and remained on the faculty until her death. She also introduced the technique at many schools, including the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and the Arena Stage in Washington.         Ms. Leibowitz was co-author with Bill Conninton of "The Alexander Technique," which was published in August by Harper Collins Publishers.         Besides her sister, she is survived by a niece and nephew.       
         Elinor Cocheran Ayers, a former high school teacher who became a leading dog breeder, died on Wednesday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. She was 62 years old and lived in Manchester, Vt. No cause of death was given.         Beginning in 1972, when she moved to Manchester and re-established the Seaward Kennels, which had been started by her mother in 1932, Miss Ayers became a major dog breeder. She specialized in American, Canadian Black and Landseer Newfoundlands.         Her greatest victory came in 1984 when Ch. Seaward's Blackbeard became the only Newfoundland ever to be named best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club's annual fixture at Madison Square Garden.         Before her dog-breeding career, Miss Ayers taught at the Ferry Hall School in Lake Forest, Ill., worked as a guidance counselor at Danbury (Conn.) High School and served as dean of girls at Montclair (N.J.) High School. She is survived by a brother, Stewart ayers, Of St. Petersburg, Fla.       
         Bertha A. Normano, a teacher of Russian at Middlebury College before her retirement in 1968, died Sunday at the Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, Vt. She was 104 years old and lived in Middlebury.         Mrs. Normano was born in Ekaterinoslav, now Dnepropetrovsk, in Russia. She left Russia in 1919 and lived in Berlin and Paris before coming to the United States in 1931.         She worked at the Latin American Economic Institute and the Institute of Asian Economics in New York before teaching Russian, first at the Asian Institute and then at City College and at Hunter College. In 1951, she became executive secretary of the Middlebury College Russian School, and from 1956 until her retirement she taught Russian there.         Her husband, John F. Normano, died in 1945. There are no survivors.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Marie Provaznik, a leader of the nationalist Sokol gymnastics movement in Czechoslovakia who defected to the United States after directing the Czechoslovak women's contingent at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, died on Jan. 11 at St. Clair's Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y. She was 100 years old, and her family said she suffered a stroke two weeks earlier.         As the leader of 500,000 women in the Czechoslovak Sokol organizations after World War II, Mrs. Provaznik was regarded in her homeland as a national heroine.         Sokol, the Czech word for falcon, symbolizing freedom, was established in 1863 to combine athletics suggestive of an army in training with national democractic resistance. Allowed to Keep Position         At the time of her defection in 1948, the year a Communist Government took over her country, Mrs. Provaznik was president of the women's divisions of both the Czechoslovak gymnastics organization and the International Gymnastics Federation in Geneva.         She was also such a popular figure that when the nation's Sokol leaders were arrested after the Communist takeover Mrs. Provaznik was allowed to retain her position.         Indeed, even after she announced that she would not return to Czechoslovakia after the 1948 Summer Games because "it is the only way to be a free agent," a spokesman for the Czechoslovak Embassy in London praised her as a "fine instructor" and an "outstanding athlete," and declared that she was going to the United States "with the blessing and knowledge of Prague."  Taught in New Jersey         In the United States, Mrs. Provaznik, who became an American citizen in 1954, taught physical education at Panzer College in New Jersey, and was active in Sokols established in New York and elsewhere.         Mrs. Provaznik, whose husband, Frantisek, died in 1948, is survived by a daughter, Dr. Alena Polesny, of Altamont, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Harriet M. Griffin, who taught mathematics at the City College of New York for 36 years before retiring in 1966, died on Jan. 13 at Kimball Medical Center in Lakewood, N.J. She was 87 years old and had lived in Lakewood since her retirement.         She died of heart failure, said a spokesman for the D'Elia Funeral Home in Lakewood.         Dr. Griffin was born in Brooklyn, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Hunter College, and held a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from New York University. She taught at Hunter College for four years before joining the City College faculty, where she rose to a full professorship.         She wrote several mathematics texts and was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         Dr. Griffin is survived by two cousins, Virginia Walsh of Toms River, N.J., and Elizabeth Pirro of Red Bank, N.J.       
         Marie Therese Gehin, a professor of French at Manhattanville College for 30 years, died on Saturday at the Holmdel Convalescent Center in New Jersey. She was 90 years old and lived in Marlboro Township, N.J.         She died of a heart attack, a funeral home representative said.         Ms. Gehin was born in Belfort, France, and educated in Europe. She taught at Manhattanville from 1940 to 1970. She also taught at the Alliance Francaise in Manhattan, Georgetown University, City College of New York and at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Conn. Ms. Gehin also wrote for a newspaper syndicate in Paris.         Her husband, Yuri Kossoff, died in 1972. She is survived by several cousins.       
         Muriel Stuart, an English-born ballerina who danced with Anna Pavlova and was a leading teacher at the School of American Ballet, died yesterday morning at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Stuart had been in poor health for years, said her son, Peter Warwick.         She came to Pavlova's attention when, at age 8, she answered an advertisement for a class for eight girls to be taught by the Russian ballerina in London. At the audition, Pavlova was fascinated by the way the child moved with the music at a sudden change of rhythm. Miss Stuart's musicality and lyricism were the hallmarks of her style as a dancer with Pavlova, whose company she joined at age 13, and as a teacher at the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet. A Gifted Trainer         Miss Stuart danced with Pavlova until 1926, when she left to marry a violinist, Julian Brodetsky. In 1927 she moved with him to Los Angeles, where she opened a dance school. Except for a brief stint as a first ballerina and choreographer with the Chicago Lyric Opera, she spent the rest of her career teaching, and she become known as a gifted trainer of female dancers.         She was invited to teach at the School of American Ballet in 1935. Since she had recently studied modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg, Martha Graham and Agnes de Mille, she was asked to teach classes in an ill-defined style that was less stringent than ballet but not quite modern dance. "My dear, if I'd sat them on the floor, they'd have died," she once said of her early students.         Though regal in manner, Miss Stuart was known for her waspish but understated wit. "It's either innate or it ain't," a student recalled her saying about rhythm. She could be transfixed by gifted students' dancing, as she was when Allegra Kent, a favorite, entered the school.         Born in a London suburb, South Norwood, Miss Stuart also studied with Enrico Cecchetti. She wrote, with Lincoln Kirstein, "The Classic Ballet: Basic Technique and Terminology," a 1952 book that has become a standard text.         Miss Stuart's first marriage ended in divorce, as did her second marriage, to James Warwick, a playwright. She is survived by her son, who lives in Middletown, N.J.       
         Dorothy Wite, a professor at the Hunter-Bellevue Nursing School of the City University of New York, died last Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. White died of cancer, said her husband, Gerard M. White, a retired cost engineer.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from Long Island College School of Nursing. She received B.S., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in education from Columbia University.         She joined the Hunter faculty in 1979 and was dean of the nursing school from 1979 to 1982. She previously taught or ran nursing programs at California State University in Sacramento, the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta and at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.       
         Rhoda Bacmeister, an authority on early childhood education who directed nursery schools and wrote eight books about children, died on Wednesday at All Saints Catholic Nursing Home in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 97 years old and lived in Clemson, S.C.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Bacmeister taught at the Manhasset Bay School in Port Washington, L.I., in the 1930's. In World War II she set up day-care centers in Philadelphia for children of women working in war plants. After the war she was director of the Manhattanville Nursery School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She was a native of Northampton, Mass., and a graduate of Vassar College and the University of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree.         Mrs. Bacmeister wrote four books on early childhood education and four on literature for children.         She is survived by two daughters, Lucretia Harrison of Port Washington and Margaret Gruger of Anderson, S.C.; a son, Theodore, of Jacksonville; five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Aryness Joy Wickens, an economist and statistician who played the crucial role in developing the Government's cost-of-living index, now the Consumer Price Index, died last Saturday at the Lakeland Health Care Center in Jackson, Miss. She was 90 years old and lived in Jackson.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Wickens retired from the Department of Labor in 1970 after a 42-year career in Fderal service that began when she joined the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in 1928 after having taught at Mount Holyoke College for four years.         In 1933 she served on a committee organized by the American Statistical Association to advise Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins on setting up the Bureau of Labor Statistics program. A few years later she directed the bureau's studies for the Temporary National Economic Committee's investigation of monopolistic practices in industry.         When the bureau was reorganized in 1940, Mrs. Wickens became chief of the branch studying prices and the cost of living. From 1946 to 1961 she was assistant and then deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics.         In 1952 she was president of the American Statistical Association. Eight years later, in recognition of her outstanding Government service, she was one of six recipients of the first Federal Women's Awards of the Civil Service Commission. Adviser at U.N. Conferences         In 1961, after having been a United States adviser at many United Nations and other international conferences, Mrs. Wickens was named economic adviser to the Secretary of Labor. In that post she laid the statistical base for what became the department's Manpower Administration and its Employment and Training Administration.         After retirement Mrs. Wickens served on the advisory board of the United States Export-Import Bank. In 1976 she returned to government work as director of statistical studies for the Commission on Federal Paperwork.         Mrs. Wickens was born in Bellingham, Wash. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Washington and held a master's degree from the University of Chicago. She lived near Vienna, Va., before moving to Jackson four years ago.         Her husband, David L. Wickens, an economist, died in 1970. She is survived by a son, Donaldson, of Jackson, and three grandsons.       
         Gwendolen M. Carter, a teacher and writer who was an authority on Africa and one of the founders of African studies in the United States, died yesterday at her home in Orange City, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Dr. Carter died of congestive heart failure, said Judith Bosford, her nurse.         Miss Carter was a professor of political science at Smith College from 1943 to 1964, where she held the Sophia Smith Chair from 1961 to 1964. She also taught at Northwestern University (1964-1974), where she held the title of Melville J. Herskovits Professor of African Affairs; Indiana University (1974-1984) and the University of Florida (1984-1987). She retired in 1987.         Born in Hamilton, Ontario, she became a naturalized American citizen in the early 1940's.         While teaching at Smith College, Dr. Carter decided to examine the major countries of the British Commonwealth.         She recalled later that in 1948 it was "when I first met South Africa." From then on she specialized in African affairs, particularly southern Africa.         Widely respected as an authoritative scholar, Dr. Carter wrote several books including a carefully documented analysis of apartheid, "The Politics of Equality" (1955, Frederick A. Praeger); "Independence for Africa" (1960, Praeger), and "Government and Politics in the Twentieth Century," with John H. Herz (1961, Praeger).         Dr. Carter did not believe that racial conflict was inevitable.         "I don't believe in inevitability," she said in an interview about the political struggle in South Africa. "I'm optimistic. I favor people who are fighting for things. They are going to have a very hard time. But there are magnificent people there, so much good will, so many whites and blacks who are determined to change the situation. It's a mammoth job."         Dr. Carter graduated from the University of Toronto in 1929. She also received a master's degree from Oxford and a doctorate from Radcliffe College.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  February 22, 1991, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Gwendolen Carter, a scholar on Africa, misidentified a book she wrote about apartheid. It was "The Politics of Inequality."       
         Ruth Hill McGregor, a cello and ensemble teacher at the School for Strings on West 54th Street, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a pulmonary embolism, the hospital said.         Mrs. McGregor graduated from Smith College in 1930 and then studied cello with Felix Salmond at Juilliard. With her friend Dorothy Fay Little, she founded the Greenwood Music Camp, a summer camp for children in Cummington, Mass., and served as a director there for 50 years.         She was treasurer of the Amateur Chamber Music Players for 25 years. Before joining the School for Strings, she was the director of instrumental music at the Chapin School and also taught at the Brearley School.         She is survived by her husband, Rumsey; a daughter, Louise Griggs of Hanover, N.H.; a son, David, of Forest Hills, Queens; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ruth Landes, an anthropologist who won critical acclaim for her studies of black Brazilians, Indians in North Dakota and Hispanic-Americans in the American Southwest, died on Feb. 11 at her home in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 82 years old.         Dr. Landes's best-known book was "The City of Women," published in 1947 by Macmillan, in which she reported on life around the Brazilian seaport of Bahia, in which women played the dominant roles in a society of descendants of African slaves.         Dr. Landes was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Joseph Schlossberg, a co-founder of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. While attending New York University, where she earned a bachelor's degree, she began a four-year anthropological study of black Jews and of followers of Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement.         She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work and a doctorate from Columbia, under whose auspices she did research among North Dakota's Ojibwa Indians. Her nine published works include studies of other Indian tribes and a treatise on bilingualism and biculturalism in Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Canada and the United States.         Since 1965 Dr. Landes had taught at McMaster University in Hamilton.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Katinka Loeser, many of whose short stories were infused with what a critic described as "autobiographical sketches of warmth and charm," died Wednesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. She was 77 years old and lived in Westport.         She died of kidney failure, said her daughter, Jan DeVries.         Miss Loeser published three collections of stories, most of which first appeared in The New Yorker: "Tomorrow Will Be Monday: Stories of Parents and Children" (1964); "The Archers at Home" (1968), about a suburban couple afflicted with empty-nest syndrome, and "A Thousand Pardons" (1982), stories about a Westport couple who enjoy their lives and the changing seasons.         Miss Loeser was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on July 2, 1913, and grew up in Chicago. She started writing poetry when she was 14. In 1943 she won the Young Poet's Prize of Poetry magazine, and her poems later appeared in The New Yorker. She was notified of the Young Poet's Prize in a telegram from the editor of Poetry, the humorist Peter DeVries, whom she married later that year.         In an interview in 1982, Miss Loeser maintained that it is more difficult to write short stories and poetry than novels. With a poem, she said, "You're thinking in abstract terms and trying to get a rhythm." In a novel, she added, "There is more leeway." But to be a successful writer of any kind, she added, "you have to be a decent reader from the time you're small."         At the University of Chicago, from which she graduated in 1936, Miss Loeser studied under the playwright Thornton Wilder, one of her favorite teachers. When she taught a writing class at the Westport Division of Continuing Education in the 1970's, she adopted the Wilder method of reading his students' stories out loud, anonymously, and having the other students critique them.         Miss Loeser is survived by her husband and three children: Jan DeVries of Media, Pa.; Peter Jon, of New York City, and Derek, of Santa Monica, Calif. Another daughter, Emily, died of leukemia in childhood and is remembered in Miss Loeser's story "Whose Little Girl Are You?" and in Mr. DeVries's book "The Blood of the Lamb."       
         Eleanor King, a modern-dance choreographer and a member of the original Doris Humphrey-Charles Weidman company, died on Wednesday at the Actor's Home in Haddonfield, N.J. She was 85 years old.         Miss King had been in ill health since injuring her hip six weeks ago, a colleague, Mino Nicholas, said.         Miss King danced with Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman, two pioneers of American modern dance, from 1928 to 1935. She also appeared in Leonide Massine's "Sacre du Printemps" at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1930. She began to present programs of her own work during the 1930's, and in 1943 established a company in Seattle. She became known for choreography based on works of literature, from Petrarch to James Joyce.         Her dances were largely unknown to audiences of the 1980's until Annabelle Gamson staged highly praised revivals of her work in 1987 and 88 in New York. The solos were praised in The New York Times for their eloquence and for Miss King's careful shaping of ideas and feelings.  Studied in Japan         Miss King was born in Middletown, Pa. She trained in dance at the Theater Guild School and with Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman. She also studied mime with Etienne Decroux, and in the early 1960's studied dance in Japan. She taught at the University of Arkansas from 1951 to 1971, and then retired, making her home in Santa Fe, N.M.         The revival of her dances renewed interest in Miss King, as did her work with Mr. Nicholas on revivals of her own dances and those of Miss Humphrey and Mr. Weidman. At the time of her death she was a director of Mr. Nicholas's American Dance Repertory Theater. She wrote the book "Transformations," a memoir of the Humphrey-Weidman era, and was the subject of a 1989 collection of essays, "Eleanor King: 60 Years in American Dance."         Miss King is survived by a brother, John, of Sahuar Rita, Ariz., and a sister, Lucile C. King of Cherry Hill, N.J.       
         Dagmar Freuchen-Gale, an artist and illustrator for such fashion magazines as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, died March 9 at a hospital in Fredensborg, Denmark. She was 83 years old and had lived in Fredensborg since the early 1970's.         She died as the result of a stroke, a friend, Donald Gaynor, said.         Mrs. Freuchen-Gale came to New York from the town of Lyngpy, outside Copenhagen, in 1938 and worked for various magazines. She also taught fashion illustration at the Art Students League for 20 years, from the late 1940's.         In 1943 she married Peter Freuchen, a Danish Arctic explorer and author.  She wrote "Cookbook of the Seven Seas" (1968), and also edited several of her husband's books. Mr. Freuchen died in 1963. In 1967 she married Henry Gale, a New York lawyer He died in 1969.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Olga Kattan, a professor of Spanish language and literature at Brooklyn College for the last 25 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         She died of cancer, her niece, Roxanna Siman, said.         Dr. Kattan, a 1963 Ph.D. graduate of the University of Madrid, taught at the University of Pennsylvania and at Wells College before joining Brooklyn College in 1966. For many years, she directed the City University of New York's program abroad at the University of Seville and often took groups of students from the New York metropolitan area to Spain.         In 1988 the Government of Spain honored her with an award for fostering intercultural understanding. Dr. Kattan did extensive research on the Arabic influence in Spanish literature and recently completed a translation of a medieval Hispanic-Arabic manuscript.         She is survived by her mother, Mania, of Manhattan; two sisters, Jeanette Siman of Guatemala City and Betty Nasser of New Windsor, N.Y., and two brothers, Antonio, of Caracas, Venezuela, and Rene, of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.       
         Katherine Warren, a research scientist and former grants administrator for the National Institutes of Health, died March 23 at Greater Laurel Beltsville Hospital in Laurel, Md. She was 82 years old and lived in Laurel.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Virginia Egan of Cairo.         A graduate of Columbia University with a doctorate in zoology and genetics, Dr. Warren retired in 1971 after working at the National Institutes of Health for 10 years.         Before that, she was executive director of the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology on Long Island and taught biology at Adelphi University, Hofstra University, Cornell University Medical College and Wellesley College.         She is survived by two other daughters, Margaret Loiselle of Boardman, Ohio, and Constance Warren of Laurel, Md., and three grandchildren.       
         Cora DuBois, an anthropologist, teacher and author who was an authority on Southeast Asia, died Sunday at a nursing home in Brookline, Mass. She was 87 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of pneumonia and heart failure, her secretary, Eric Davis, said.         Dr. DuBois was the Zimurray Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University and Radcliffe College when she retired in 1969. In World War II, she served with the Office of Strategic Services. She was later with the State Department, the Institute of International Education and the Far Eastern Association.         In 1938 Dr. DuBois, who had taught anthropology at Hunter College, went to live in Alor, a small island in the Dutch East Indies. Living alone in a house in a remote mountain village, she learned the local language and was able to win the confidence of villagers by giving simple medical aid. Study of Islanders         The result of her 18-month inquiry was "The People of Alor," a social and psychological study published in 1944 that won acclaim for its thoroughness and lucidity. She also wrote "Social Forces in Southeast Asia," which appeared in 1949, and her writings were widely published in scholarly journals.         Dr. DuBois was a graduate of Barnard College, where she worked under the anthropologists Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. She received her doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley after extensive ethnographic studies of Indian tribes in the American Northwest.         When she returned from Alor, Dr. DuBois tought at Sarah Lawrence College before joining the Office of Strategic Services in 1942 as chief of its Indonesia section. She later became chief of research and analysis for the Army's Southeast Asia Command.         The Army awarded Dr. DuBois the Exceptional Civilian Award, and she also received the Order of the Crown of Thailand for her participation in the Free Thai underground movement through the O.S.S. From 1945 to 1949 she was Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the State Department's Office of Intelligence Research.         In 1951 Dr. DuBois was named to direct a study of educational needs and resources of third world areas. In 1954 she was appointed director of the Far Eastern Association and at the same time returned to academic life with her appointment at Harvard and Radcliffe.         Dr. DuBois was president of the American Anthropological Associaton in 1968-69 and of the Association for Asian Studies in 1969-70.         She leaves no immediate family survivors. Her longtime companion was Jeanne Taylor.       
         Katya Delakova, a dancer and choreographer who specialized in Jewish themes, died Wednesday at her home in Titusville, N.J. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, her husband, Moshe M. Budmor, said.         Born in Vienna, Miss Delakova graduated from the Academy of Music and Dance. She performed and toured Europe with Gertrud Kraus, a modern dancer, until fleeing the Nazis and immigrating to New York in 1939.         In 1942, she married Fred Berk, a dancer with whom she presented programs of Jewish dance. She began the first classes in Jewish folk dance at the 92d Street Y and with her husband created the Jewish Dance Repertory Group. They also conducted folk dance festivals for the Hebrew Arts Committee at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         Miss Delakova lived in Israel from 1953 to 1958 after her divorce from Mr. Berk. It was there, after studying with Moshe Feldenkreis, that she became interested in Eastern movement disciplines, such as Hatha Yoga, which she also taught. From 1966 to 1975, she headed a program called "The Art of Moving" at Sarah Lawrence College.         She is survived by her husband, a former professor of music at Trenton State College.       
         Sarah Jane Kinoy, a teacher and social worker who was an early leader in the education of children with cerebral palsy, died on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 96 years old and had lived in Manhattan and Tompkins Corners, N.Y.         She died of heart failure, said her son Ernest.         Mrs. Kinoy, a graduate of Teachers College, was a social worker with the American Red Cross during World War I and later taught at the Brooklyn Ethical Culture School and at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         She was a founder of the Brooklyn Community School in the early 1940's and was executive director of the New York Service for Orthopedic Handicapped. At Teachers College she coordinated the special education department for children with cerebral palsy and in the 1950's, in cooperation with the New York City Board of Education, she developed a pilot school for Manhattan children with the disease. She later served as director of services for Cerebral Palsy of Queens.         She is survived by two sons, Ernest, a television writer, of Williamsville, Vt., and Arthur of Montclair, N.J., a Rutgers University law professor; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Hannah Falk Hofheimer, a philanthropist and a major benefactor of Barnard, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 102 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her lawyer, Bernard Gartlir.         Mrs. Hofheimer, a 1909 graduate of Barnard College, taught for five years in the New York public schools before devoting herslf to volunteer work. She was a major benefactor of Barnard and on the occasion of her 90th birthday endowed the Hannah and Henry Hofheimer Scholarship there. She also supported the League of Women Voters, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the United Jewish Appeal and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. Her husband, Henry, a Manhattan lawyer, died in 1975.         She is survived by a son, Joseph, of Scarsdale; a daughter, Babette Sonneborn, also of Scarsdale; 10 grandchildren, and 28 great-grandchildren.       
         Martha Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of this century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Miss Graham died of cardiac arrest after being treated for two months for pneumonia, said Ron Protas, general director of the Martha Graham Dance Company. Miss Graham had become ill in December after a 55-day tour of the Far East with her troupe. She entered the hospital on Jan. 15 and returned home two weeks ago.         Frequently ranked with Picasso, Stravinsky and James Joyce for developing a form of expression that broke the traditional mold, Miss Graham was initially acclaimed as a great dancer. Masterworks and Invention         Yet ultimately her genius -- universally recognized as she became the most honored figure in American dance -- was embodied in her choreographic masterworks and her invention of a new and codified dance language.         The Graham technique, which is now used by dance companies throughout the world, became the first enduring alternative to the idiom of classical ballet. Powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension, this vocabulary combined with Miss Graham's distinctive system of training to set her above other dance innovators.         Although such achievements were part of Miss Graham's multi-faceted pioneering role in helping to establish modern dance outside the older ballet tradition after the 1920's, she continued to amaze her public for more than 60 years. She choreographed more than 180 works. The most recent was her self-mocking "Maple Leaf Rag," which had its premiere on Oct. 2 with the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York.         Throughout her career, Miss Graham's fundamental tenet was that dance should reach audiences through a visceral response rather than an objective image that registered upon the intellect. "Out of emotion comes form," she said, and then proved that out of form she could re-create the same emotion onstage.         She never wavered in her belief that movement could express inner feeling. Miss Graham sought to give "visible substance to things felt" and to "chart the graph of the heart." These celebrated Graham phrases became the metaphors central to her art.         Miss Graham's dances spoke elo- quently against the crushing of the human spirit, and one of her frequent themes was the condemnation of intolerance, especially toward nonconformists.         Her own life as a creative artist epitomized the independent spirit with which she so frequently imbued her dramatic heroines. The figure conquering sexual fear in "Errand Into the Maze," the woman looking deep into herself while preparing for an unnamed fate in "Herodiade" and the American pioneer brimming with optimism in "Frontier" could also be Clytemnestra or Jocasta, antiquity's queens who -- in the Graham canon -- emerged from crisis through the sheer force of self-understanding. Miss Graham usually cast herself at the center of these works until 1969, when she gave her last performance and retired reluctantly from the stage at the age of 75.         Because she rarely met conventional expectations about dance, she was both misunderstood and acclaimed. She was surrounded by debate throughout her career; few remained indifferent to her. Acknowledgment of Miss Graham's role as a dominant force in all the arts at first came from painters, writers, musicians and the acting profession. Gregory Peck and Bette Davis were among the many drama students she taught over the years at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Graham to perform at the White House in 1937, and in 1976 Miss Graham became the first dance personality to receive, from President Gerald R. Ford, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.         Nonetheless, Miss Graham's highly intense dancing and choreography were not intended to soothe the spirit and did not find ready acceptance. Quest for Inner Reality, But Never for Realism         Like Picasso, she was concerned with an inner reality. "For me, dance is theater," she wrote. But she never resorted to a realistic theater. More often than not, her choreography presented a dancer's body as distorted or dislocated, an assemblage of forms aligned into maximum expressiveness.         Audiences throughout the world were often disturbed by Miss Graham's frank acknowledgment of human sexuality, especially in her famous cycle inspired by Greek myths. Miss Graham's Medea, Jocasta, Phaedra and Clytemnestra gave vent to their lust and hate, baring the passions that few humans liked to recognize in themselves but that Miss Graham exposed with the unflinching scrutiny of a 20th-century Jungian analyst.         For Miss Graham, dance became a collective memory that could communicate the emotions universal to all civilizations: mythology, she felt, was the psychology of the ancients.         Miss Graham's encyclopedic approach to dance -- a creative wellspring from sources as varied as American Indian rituals to the Bible -- often carried several levels of meaning and startled a public that defined dance in linear or pictorial terms. Miss Graham, for her part, said she wanted her dances to be "felt" rather than comprehended in the usual manner.         In 1944, John Martin, dance critic for The New York Times, wrote of the emotional effect that the Graham dance theater could have upon the viewer. He warned that "Deaths and Entrances," the choreographer's study of turbulent passions inspired by Anne, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, the 19th-century English writers, was "un-understandable through the usual organs of understanding" and "slips in through sensory perceptions." The Graham Technique Is Based on Breathing         In general, Miss Graham saw art as a reflection of its time inseparable from life. "My dancing," she said, "is not an attempt to interpret life in the literary sense. It is an affirmation of life through movement."         Even the dance technique that she hammered out on her own body and then transferred to her school and company derived from the most organic aspect of human life: the act of breathing. That act was formalized and dramatized in the idiom's most basic principle, called contraction and release -- intensified moments of exhalation and inhalation. Miss Graham said her aim was "to increase the emotional activity of the dancer's body so that you are teaching the body, not teaching the mind."         The contraction, originating in the dancer's pelvis, created the percussive angular movement and sexual tension that invariably startled a newcomer to the Graham repertory. But it is the Graham idiom as a whole that can look strange to those who expect more of a continuum in dancing. Being 'the Thing Itself' Instead of Portraying It         Above all, she said, "Dance is not representational." Miss Graham recalled in later years that as a young dancer about to embark upon an independent career in 1922, she had chanced upon a nonfigurative painting by Wassily Kandinsky -- a slash of red against a field of blue. "I will dance like that," she said.         Like other modernists, Miss Graham rejected literal imagery in favor of abstraction. Form for form's sake, however, held no interest for her. Instead she focused on abstraction in its strict sense, that of extracting the essence of a quality of emotion. A celebrated example was "Lamentation," the 1930 solo in which Miss Graham, encased in a tube of stretch jersey, created sharply angular shapes on a bench. She did not dance about grief, but sought to be what she called "the thing itself" or the embodiment of grief.         Miss Graham's gift for the distilled image ranged over her entire career. In "Cave of the Heart" (1946), her Medea was the personification of hate, consumed by the venom of jealousy as visualized in snakelike contours.         The quintessential Graham could be found in "Frontier" (1935), one of the choreographer's pieces on overt American themes. The solo initiated her 32-year collaboration with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi.         The set for "Frontier" was a fragment of a fence seemingly anchored by a rope behind. It had the same spareness and economy of Miss Graham's solo and the score of her music director and mentor of that time, Louis Horst. Noguchi noted in general that he had found in Miss Graham "a drive that motivated her to strip the dance to its stark rudiment." Noguchi's Sets Sought 'A Limitless Illusion'         Both artists shared an affinity for forms that looked abstract and were resonant with multiple meanings. Writing in 1984, Noguchi said that for "Frontier" he had "thought to catch the essential sculpture of space -- a limitless illusion." He continued: "This is the path I continued to investigate whenever Martha would call on me to rise to the occasion. She is the one who always came to me with her requirements and the myth she wished to encompass. My role was to respond."         Miss Graham's work revealed an integrated vision. She began using contemporary scores for the company she formed in 1929. After 1934, she tended to use commissioned music and was guided here by Horst, a composer who insisted that dance had a life independent of music and did not derive from it. Miss Graham herself, sometimes accused of using dance as mere aural decor, often said that she did not seek to interpret another art form -- that is, music.         Among the composers who wrote scores for Miss Graham were Samuel Barber, William Schuman, Gian Carlo Menotti and Aaron Copland, whose score for her 1944 classic, "Appalachian Spring," won the Pulitzer Prize.         Martha Graham, the eldest of three daughters, was born on May 11, 1894, in Allegheny, Pa., to George Graham, a physician who specialized in mental disorders, and the former Jane (Jenny) Beers, a descendant of Miles Standish. In 1908, the family moved to Santa Barbara, Calif. Started Dance Training At 22, After Father Died         In 1916, after the death of her father and after graduation from a junior college, the Cumnock School, Miss Graham enrolled in the Denishawn school in Los Angeles and then joined the Denishawn Company. Denishawn, organized by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, was then the only major dance company that worked outside the classical ballet tradition, and it became the incubating ground for such pioneering talents as Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Miss Graham herself.         John Murray Anderson saw Miss Graham with Denishawn and hired her for his Greenwich Village Follies in 1923 and 1924. But in those two years Miss Graham realized that neither Denishawn, with its exotic pretexts for dances, nor the commercial theater was right for her. At the invitation of Rouben Mamoulian, she joined the dance division of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she taught dance.         On April 18, 1926, she made her concert debut at the 48th Street Theater in New York with works that still showed the influence of Denishawn. "The idiom," the critic Robert Sabin recalled in 1953, "was still prevalently romantic and eclectic, but the spirit was new and as bracing as a salty sea wind."         Miss Graham taught in the early years in her studio at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 13th Street, and at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She assembled a company of women. Because the members had to support themselves, they would work on new works for nine months, then give a few recitals in New York and go on tour.         From her group, augmented by men in 1938 to 1939, came the next generation of modern dancers, choreographers and teachers: Anna Sokolow, Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, May O'Donnell, Erick Hawkins, Merce Cunningham and later Paul Taylor and John Butler. Miss Graham, who had a long-term relationship with Horst, was married in 1948 to Mr. Hawkins. They separated in the early 1950's and were later divorced. Received Financial Help From Many Individuals         Before World War II, Miss Graham took on outside assignments. In 1930, she was the Chosen One in Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski and choreographed by Leonide Massine. A few years later she collaborated on dramatic productions with Blanche Yurka, Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, and Archibald MacLeish.         Troubled by the recurring financial problems that were endemic to an art form struggling for acceptance, Miss Graham was helped over the years by individual patrons. Among them were Frances Steloff, founder of the Gotham Book Mart, whose $1,000 loan made the initial 1926 concert possible, Miss Cornell, Bethsabee de Rothschild, Lila Acheson Wallace and, most recently, Halston. Mrs. Wallace made it possible for the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance to acquire the building at 316 East 63d Street, where the Graham school is situated.         In the early years, Miss Graham costumed herself and the women in her troupe in stretch jersey. She later referred to this time as her "long woolens" period. Her dances were spare and stark, testimony to her deep interest in ritual, and she was strongly influenced by the ceremonial Indian dances she had witnessed in the Southwest. These experiences were reflected in such works as "Primitive Mysteries" and "El Penitente," which remain in her company's repertory. From American Themes To Ancient Mythology         In the 1930's, Miss Graham was known for her American themes. "We must look to America to bring forth an art as powerful as America itself," she said, and produced such works as "American Document," "American Provincials," "Appalachian Spring," "Letter to the World" and "Salem Shore."         After 1946, she immersed herself in Hebrew and Greek mythology with "Cave of the Heart," "Night Journey," "Errand Into the Maze," "Judith," "The Witch of Endor," "Phaedra" and, most powerfully, the full-evening "Clytemnestra" of 1958. She picked up historical personages with legendary qualities, the Bronte sisters for "Deaths and Entrances" and Joan of Arc for "Seraphic Dialogue."         As the years progressed, Miss Graham was loath to leave the stage. Since she was the central figure on that stage, she eventually began to create roles for herself that were less physically demanding. After her retirement from dancing, her new works rarely focused on a protagonist.         Repeatedly acclaimed as a choreographer, she always considered herself a dancer first. After relinquishing her roles to younger dancers, she continued to direct her company. She made triumphant tours to the Far East and Europe under Government auspices and, in her 80's and 90's, increasingly traveled abroad with her company. Her tour last fall took in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Congressional Propriety Offended by 'Phaedra'         It was on a European trip in 1962 that she ran afoul of two United States Representatives, Edna Kelly of Brooklyn and Peter Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. They saw "Phaedra" in Bonn and, apparently not knowing the Greek legend of a queen's passion for her stepson, protested that the work was too explicit to be a proper cultural export for the United States.         Although Miss Graham was identified with a new art form that initially rejected classical ballet as being inadequate for contemporary expression, she collaborated with ballet's leading personalities.         In 1959, the New York City Ballet presented "Episodes," consisting of two sections to Webern's music. George Balanchine choreographed one half and Miss Graham the other. In 1975, just before Dame Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev appeared as guests in her company, she declared, "The war has ended," alluding to the perceived conflict between modern dance and ballet. Further proof came when Mikhail Baryshnikov appeared as a guest with her troupe from 1987 to 1989.         Among Miss Graham's awards were the first Guggenheim Fellowship given to a dancer; the Kennedy Center Honors; the Aspen Award in the Humanities; the Capezio Dance Award; the first Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance Festival Award to honor achievement in modern dance; the Meadows Award in the performing arts; the Handel Medallion of New York City; the Henry Hadley medal for contribution to American music, and the first National Medal of Arts.         In 1987, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave Miss Graham the Ingenio et Arti medal, a rarely awarded honor and her country's highest distinction for contributions to the arts and sciences. Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, personally decorated her in 1984 with the Legion of Honor at the Paris Opera. She received a number of honorary degrees, from Yale, Harvard and other universities.         Miss Graham liked to emphasize that her work and private life were separate. "I have always fought against any dramatization of my peculiarities or my personality," she said. Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Lask noted it was through her work "that she had, in William Faulkner's apt phrase, put a scratch on the face of eternity."         Martha Graham was living proof of her own adage: "No artist is ahead of his time. He         is         his time; it is just that others are behind the time."         Miss Graham leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Isabel Cary Lundberg, an educator and sociologist, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Dr. Lundberg, a 1925 graduate of Vassar College, was an editor at several magazines, including Cosmopolitan, and an assistant to the president of an educational consulting firm before earning a Ph.D. in 1957 from the New School for Social Research. She then taught sociology at Hunter College, New York University and the Fashion Institute of Technology. She was a member of the American Sociological Association and wrote "Turgot's Unknown Translator: The Reflections and Adam Smith," published in 1964 by Martinus Nijhoff in The Hague.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Jane Cooper Bland, a teacher of art and art appreciation to young children, died on Friday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had an apartment in Greenwich Village.         Mrs. Bland died of heart failure after suffering complications following heart surgery, her family said.         In 1951, while she was with the Museum of Modern Art, Mrs. Bland wrote in The New York Times that it was important "for us art teachers to provide the opportunity for children to express their ideas and feelings with confidence that they will be accepted and respected."         Her work at the museum included holding classes for children and also providing instruction for other teachers.         The other institutions where she taught in New York over the years included the Horace Mann and Fieldston Schools. She also held workshops around the country.         Mrs. Bland was born in Boston, grew up in New York, studied at Pratt Institute and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University Teachers College.         Her writings included the book "The Art of Young Children."         Mrs. Bland was the widow of Harry McNeil Bland, an art dealer who died in 1960.         She is survived by a son, John Cooper Bland of Conshohocken, Pa.; five grandchidren and five great-grandchildren.

         Twila Lytton Cavert, an educator who was an early advocate of higher status for women in church affairs, died on Tuesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 96 years old.         After World War II, Mrs. Cavert directed a two-year study of women in churches in 54 countries. She was chairwoman of the resulting International Conference of Church Women in Baarn, the Netherlands, in 1948. This preceded the meeting in Amsterdam of the First Assembly of the World Council of Churches, which recommended that churches give a full range of responsibilities to women.         Mrs. Cavert received a bachelor's degree in 1915 at Ohio Weselyan University and a master's at Columbia University, She taught social studies at Ohio Wesleyan, at Women's Union College in Tokyo, Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., and Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville. She was a director of the Young Women's Christian Association from 1928 to 1944. In 1941 she became a director of the United Council of Church Women.         In the 1930's she was a trustee of the Women's College of Yenching University at Beijing, and of Mount Holyoke College.

         Ilse Lichtenstadter, a teacher of Middle Eastern languages and philosophy, died Wednesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 89 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         Dr. Lichtenstadter died of pnuemonia, said her nephew, Julius Marek of Brooklyn.         From 1960 until she retired in 1974, Dr. Lichtenstadter was a tenured lecturer in Arabic at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard.         A native of Hamburg, Germany, she studied languages and philosophy at the Universities of Hamburg and Frankfurt. In 1931 she received a doctorate from the University of Frankfurt, where she remained until the Nazis came to power.         In 1933 she moved to England and continued her studies at Cambridge and then Oxford, where in 1937 she received a doctorate in philosophy.         The next year Dr. Lichtenstadter came to the United States and became a cataloguer of Judaica at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan.         In 1942 she was named professor of Arabic literature and Islamic culture at the Asia Institute in New York. She also taught for several years at the Institute for Regional Studies of New York University and at Rutgers University before joining the Harvard faculty.         She wrote and edited several books on Islam and classical literature.         She is survived by a sister, Irma Ullmann of Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Letitia Grierson, an educator and freelance editor, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.

         Dr. Marjorie Harley, a psychoanalyst who specialized in treating children and adolescents, died Wednesday at her home in Baltimore. She was 77 years old.         She died of a brain tumor, an associate said.         Dr. Harley, who was born in New York City, received a bachelor's degree at Barnard College and master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. After moving to Baltimore in 1965 she took part in training programs at the Baltimore Institute of Psychoanalysis.

There are no immediate survivors.       
         Ruth Hornby Page, an educator and former executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, died on Sunday at Jupiter (Fla.) Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Tequesta, Fla.         She died of complications from heart surgery, said her grandson, Christopher Drew.         Mrs. Page, a 1932 graduate of Montclair State College, taught English at Park Ridge High School and Fairleigh Dickinson University before joining the staff of the School Boards Association in 1957.

         Jean Arthur, the buoyant actress whose piquant charm and infectious laughter enriched some of the finest comedy dramas of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at the Carmel Convalescent Hospital in Carmel, Calif., where she lived for 35 years. She was 90 years old.         Miss Arthur died of a heart ailment, a family spokeswoman said.         Miss Arthur had a bubbly flair for reflecting the absurdities of life, a subtle vulnerability and a voice that wavered unpredictably between the spunky and the amiable.         The classic films she graced included three by Frank Capra -- "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" -- and also George Stevens's "More the Merrier" and Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair."  A Marshmallow Heart         Miss Arthur's winsome talent was brightest in roles where her hard-boiled career woman's exterior masked a marshmallow heart, as when she first exploited and then inspired such country bumpkins as Gary Cooper as Mr. Deeds and James Stewart as Mr. Smith in their uphill challenges to greed and corruption.         The actress's honesty made even implausible scenes and films appear credible. A shy perfectionist, she was invariably self-critical of her performances, refused to pose for cheesecake photographs, rarely granted interviews and was often suspended by Columbia Pictures for rejecting roles. "I just couldn't act in a bad picture," she once said.         She began acting on the Broadway stage and returned in 1950 for a widely praised performance in the title role of "Peter Pan," Sir James M. Barrie's 1904 fantasy about the lad who refused to grow up. The production had 321 performances, one of the longest runs for the classic. Interpreting 'Peter Pan'         The hit prompted Miss Arthur to drop her guard and give an interviewer this interpretation of the theme: "Peter represents the youth in all of us: the freshness and originality of childhood before our parents and schoolteachers have pressed us into a mold. Barrie meant that we should not let that 'genius of childhood' escape us, not let our neighbors and the man at the corner grocery store do our thinking for us. If I can get over the message that we should all try to be ourselves, to be free individuals, then I'm sure I'll have accomplished what Barrie wanted."         The actress, who was originally named Gladys Georgianna Greene, was born on Oct. 17, 1900, in Plattsburg, N.Y., and grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Her father was a photographer. When pressed by Hollywood to choose a stage name, she selected one honoring two idols: Jeanne d'Arc and King Arthur.         She attended George Washington High School and soon became a successful advertising model, which led to a movie test and contract. She acted in dozens of silent two-reel comedies, melodramas and westerns. Easily making the transition to sound, she played ingenues in a spate of comedies, adventure yarns and melodramas. In three of them, she had to cope wih the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (played by Warner Oland).  Back to Hollywood         But unhappy with her roles and determined to master her art, Miss Arthur returned to New York in the early 1930's and acted for several years on the summer theater circuit and Broadway in a total of 14 plays. Most were flops, but critics began to laud her maturing talent.         She won a contract with Columbia Pictures, returned to Hollywood and her comic talents blossomed in "The Whole Town's Talking," a 1935 gangster yarn of mistaken identity.         Miss Arthur credited Frank Capra with nurturing her skill in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). In the first comedy, playing a reporter, she humiliates a naive well-meaning heir -- played by Mr. Cooper -- and then saves him from his greedy tormentors at a sanity hearing. In "Mr. Smith," as a secretary, she deceives an artless young senator (Mr. Stewart), but later uses her parliamentary expertise to aid his filibuster and defeat his foes.         Other comedy successes included "Easy Living," "You Can't Take It With You," "The Devil and Miss Jones," "The Talk of the Town," "The More the Merrier," in which she, with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, wrestled with the housing shortage in World War II Washington, and "A Foreign Affair." She was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in "More the Merrier."         The actress also won plaudits for roles in such films as "Diamond Jim," "The Plainsman," "History Is Made at Night," "Only Angels Have Wings," "Arizona" and later, in 1953, in "Shane," about the disturbing effect of a gunfighter (Alan Ladd) on a frontier family, with Miss Arthur playing a gentle and loyal wife and mother.         At the peak of her career, in the mid- 1940's, she began studying many liberal-arts subjects at colleges. "All my life," she said, "I've wanted to make enough money so I could stop and be a student for a while. The only real reason for living is doing what you want to do, or trying to, anyway." Years later, she taught acting at Vassar College.         Her later stage appearances were frustrated by directorial and cast disputes and illnesses. On television, she played an urbane lawyer in "The Jean Arthur Show" in 1966, but the scripts were more far-fetched than funny.         Her elusiveness led to contrasting stories about her self-doubts and later psychoanalysis with Dr. Erich Fromm. In 1972, she remarked, "I guess I became an actress because I didn't want to be myself."         Miss Arthur was married twice, to Julian Anker, a photographer, in 1928, and to Frank Ross, a producer, from 1932 to 1949. Both marriages ended in divorce.         In later decades, she spent most of her time at her coastal retreat in Carmel, where she once remarked, "I have a very good life" with some good friends, a brood of cats and "the sea on three sides of me."         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Vera Yarrow, a teacher in the New York City public school system and a diction coach to singrs and actors, died yesterday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Yarrow, the mother of the singer Peter Yarrow of the group Peter, Paul and Mary, died of leukemia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She taught English, speech and drama at various public schools, among them the Julia Richman High School in Manhattan, Walton High School in the Bronx, and Girls' Commercial High School in Brooklyn. She also lectured at Hunter College and coached singers and actors privately.         Mrs. Yarrow was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1903 and came to the United States three years later. She was a graduate of Hunter College and did postgraduate work at Columbia University.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Elena Mezzetti of Perugia, Italy; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Sara Vogan, a novelist and teacher of creative writing, was found dead on May 17 at her home in San Francisco.  She was 43 years old.         The cause of Ms. Vogan's death has not yet been determined, pending toxicology reports, the coroner's office in San Francisco said.         As a novelist, Ms. Vogan was best known for her portrayal of troubled people and their relationships. Her characters ranged from Vietnam War veterans to people with AIDS. Her most recent novel, "Blueprints," was published last year by Bantam Books. She was also the author of "Loss of Flight" (1989), "Scenes From the Homefront" (1987), which is a collection of her short stories, and "In Shelly's Leg" (1981).         Ms. Vogan, who was a member of the Bay Area Writers Workshop, taught creative writing at the University of Oregon.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  June 12, 1991, Wednesday         An obituary on Thursday about Sara Vogan, a novelist and teacher of creative writing, omitted her survivors. They are her parents, James and Bette Vogan, of Sun City, Fla.; a brother, Ritch Vogan, of Atlanta, and two sisters, Sheryl Haber, of Pittsburgh, and Jamie Gillie, of Los Angeles.       
         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.

         Eleanor Regis Sullivan, the editor in chief of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine since 1982, died on Friday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her brother George Sullivan of Belmont, Mass., said.         She was the managing editor of the monthly mystery magazine from 1970 to 1982 while also serving as editor in chief of Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine from 1975 to 1981.         She edited many anthologies of mysteries and wrote articles for newspapers, magazines and books, at times under such pen names as Lika Van Ness, Julia DeHahn and Ruth Graviros. She wrote a 1984 book, "Whodunit: a Biblio-Bio-Anecdotal Memoir of Federic Dannay," profiling the writer who, with a cousin, collaborated under the pseudonym Ellery Queen.         She was also the secretary and a board member of the Mystery Writers of America, and won the group's 1987 Ellery Queen Award for Excellence.         She was a native of Cambridge, Mass., and a graduate of Salem State College. She taught for a decade in elementary schools in Clinton, Conn., Cambridge and White Plains. For five years, she helped veterans of the Vietnam War at St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by another brother, James, of Darien, Conn., and three sisters, Mary Ford, Catherine Collins and Anne Powers, all of the Boston area.       
         Armina Marshall, an actress, a playwright and a co-administrator of the Theater Guild whose career on Broadway spanned more than half a century, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Philip Langner.         For nearly four decades beginning in the early 1920's, Miss Marshall, together with her husband, Lawrence Langner, and Theresa Helburn, co-founders of the Theater Guild, guided the subscription company through its glory years as one of the most successful producers of Broadway plays.         Miss Marshall and Mr. Langner, who had been married 37 years when he died in 1962, were the co-authors of seven plays, three of which made it to Broadway, including the 1933 hit "Pursuit of Happiness."         Miss Marshall, who was part American Indian, was born on the Cherokee Strip in what was then the Oklahoma Territory and spent her early school years in Pawnee, where her father was the sheriff. The family moved to the West Coast, and she attended the University of California at Los Angeles and taught school in Brawley, Calif., while playing small parts at local theaters.         She moved to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and in 1922 was introduced to Mr. Langner, a patent lawyer.         Miss Marshall was accepted into the Theater Guild and acted in several plays in succeeding years. In 1925 she and Mr. Langner were married. With Miss Helburn, a drama critic and director, the Langners built the Theater Guild into a Broadway powerhouse that by the time of Miss Helburn's death in 1959 had produced 190 attractions in New York City, in nine other cities across the country and in London.         The guild brought dozens of memorable productions to Broadway. Perhaps the most celebrated was "Oklahoma!" in 1943. The show, which blended narrative and song with ballet, transformed American musical theater almost overnight.         Among the outstanding playwrights whose work the guild produced were George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O'Neill, S. N. Behrman, Robert Sherwood and Maxwell Anderson. Actors who were guild regulars ranged from James O'Neill, Eugene's father, to Eva Le Gallienne, Claudette Colbert, Humphrey Bogart, Judith Anderson, Shirley Booth and Judy Holliday. Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne acted together in 19 guild-produced plays, Mr. Lunt alone in 4 others and Miss Fontanne alone in 2.         Miss Marshall was the associate director of "Theater Guild of the Air" for its eight-year run on radio and of "The U.S. Steel Hour" for eight years on television.         Miss Marshall's theatrical interests extended well beyond the guild. In World War II she was a founder of the Stage Door Canteen in Washington. She was also a founder of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., and a director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Fund, with which she was active until five years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Miss Marshall is survived by two granddaughters.         Correction:  July 23, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary headline yesterday about Armina Marshall, an actress and playwright, misstated her connection with the Theater Guild. She was a co-administrator, not a co- founder.       
         Adele Wood Timpson, one of the first blacks to become a school principal in New York City, died on Saturday at the Arden House convalescent home in Hamden, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Hamden.         Mrs. Timpson, a native New Yorker, held bachelor's and master's degrees from Hunter College. She taught and was a principal at Public School 100 in Upper Manhattan before her retirement in 1973.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Richard H. Timpson Jr. of Hamden; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.       
         Dr. Frances G. Dell, a retired English professor at Pace University, died on Sunday in Beverly Hospital in Beverly, Mass. She was 69 years old and had lived in White Plains until a recent move to Wenham, Mass.         She died of congestive heart failure, a university spokesman said.         Dr. Dell taught at Pace's Westchester-Pleasantville campus for 27 years before retiring in 1990. She was professor emeritus of literature, communications and the performing arts, and she specialized in 19th-century literature, particularly the works of Thomas Hardy, James Fenimore Cooper and the Brontes.         A native of Queens, she graduated from Queens College and held master's degrees from Teachers College, Columbia University and Fordham University, where she also earned a Ph.D. in English.         She represented Pace at three Bronte conferences in England and conducted an international Bronte conference at Pace's Westchester campus in 1985. Her articles on 19th-century fiction appeared in literary publications.         At Pace, she also served on the university Senate, moderated the English Honor Society and for many years was supervisor of student teaching.         She is survived by her husband of 45 years, Dr. Robert Dell, who also is a retired Pace professor of English, and two sons, Douglas, a Nynex executive in Middleton, Mass., and Blair, a law student in Texas.       
         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.         Dr. Weaver is believed to have been the first black woman to earn a doctorate in her field, speech correction, audiology and linguistics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Northwestern.         Dr. Weaver graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1932. She taught in speech departments at Roosevelt College in Chicago and Howard University in Washington, as well as Brooklyn College.         In 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson named her husband Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making him the first black Cabinet member in the nation's history. At first, Dr. Weaver remained at Brooklyn College and the Weavers had a commuter marriage. But, Mr. Weaver said yesterday, it was not satisfactory and she retired in 1967 to join him in Washington.         While there, she served as a consultant to the Women's Job Corps, the National Advisory Research Council of the Institute of Dental Research and the Children's Hearing and Speech Center, an affiliate of Children's Hospital.         Besides her husband, Dr. Weaver is survived by a brother, Hampton D. Haith of Winston-Salem, N.C.       
         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Eva Bertrand Adams, a gold miner's daughter who presided over the United States Mint for eight years, died Friday at a hospital in Reno. Miss Adams was 80 years old and lived in Reno.         The funeral home said she died of natural causes.         Miss Adams was born in Wonder, Nev., a gold-mining town that died when the gold ran out. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada and a master's degree in English from Columbia University.         She taught high school English in Las Vegas before returning to the University of Nevada as an instructor in 1936. She also served as assistant dean of women at the university before beginning a new career in 1940 as the principal aide to Senator Pat McCarran, Republican of Nevada, in Washington.         She continued as administrative assistant to Mr. McCarran until he died in 1954, then served under his interim successor and under Senator Alan Bible, a Democrat elected as Mr. McCarran's permanent replacement.         While working for Senator McCarran, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she received an bachelor of laws degree from George Washington University in 1948 and a doctor of laws degree from the university two years later. She became a member of the bar in her home state and in the District of Columbia, as well as of the Supreme Court bar.         In 1961, President John F. Kennedy named her director of the Mint.         During her tenure, Miss Adams authorized and supervised the construction of a new mint in Philadelphia and the expansion of the Denver Mint. She also battled an acute nationwide coin shortage in the early 1960's that was caused by hoarding and a proliferation of coin-operated vending machines.         President Lyndon B. Johnson reappointed her in 1966 and she retired from the post in September 1969 for yet another career, as a management consultant in Reno.         Miss Adams left no immediate survivors.       
         Dr. Florence B. Seibert, who invented the first reliable tuberculosis test and helped improve the safety of intravenous injections, died on Aug. 23 at the Palm Springs Nursing Home in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed. Teresa Hicks, an aide who helped care for Dr. Seibert at the home, said she had been in declining health in the last two years and suffered from complications from childhood polio.         For her pioneering research Dr. Seibert was inducted last year into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y.         She was born in Easton, Pa., and was stricken by polio at the age of 3. Forced to wear braces, she turned to academic pursuits because, she later recalled, "I couldn't go out and dance and play" like other children. Academic and Medical Achievements         She graduated at the top of her high school class and won a scholarship to Goucher College in Maryland. After graduating she worked as a chemist in a paper mill in World War I. She then won a scholarshipto Yale University, where she earned a Ph.D.         While studying at Yale she discovered that some bacteria managed to survive existing distillation methods. Contaminated distilled water, when used for intravenous injections, often caused fever in patients. Dr. Seibert devised a simpler and better distillation process that eliminated the germs, making injections safer.         A Guggenheim Fellowship led her to Uppsala University in Sweden and her best-known discovery. She devised a method for isolating tuberculosis protein molecules, then used the material to develop a skin reaction test for tuberculosis infection.         The test was adopted as the standard by the United States in 1941 and by the World Health Organization in 1952, and is still in use today. A Public Health Consultant         During her career Dr. Seibert taught and did research at the University of Chicago and the Sprague Institute in Chicago, and at the Henry Phipps Institute of the University of Pennsylvania. She was also a consultant to the United States Public Health Service.         Dr. Seibert wrote many articles for scientific journals, and held five honorary degrees. Even after she retired in Florida, Dr. Seibert conducted research on cancer.         She is survived by a younger sister, Mabel, of St. Petersburg, who assisted in Dr. Seibert's research and lived with her.       
         Persis Emma Gladieux, a teacher and expert in Japanese horticulture, died July 30 at the Woodbine Nursing Center in Alexandria, Va. She was 82 years old and lived in Alexandria.         She died of complications from a series of strokes, said a son, Lawrence Gladieux, also of Alexandria.         Mrs. Gladieux taught at the American School in Tokyo from 1930 to 1934.         In addition to her son Lawrence, she is survived by her husband, Bernard L. Gladieux Sr.; two other sons, Bernard Jr. of Gilbertsville, Pa., and Jay A. of New Canaan, Conn.; a brother, Lowell Skilliter of Toledo, Ohio; a sister, Lois Jones of Harrisburg, Va., seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  August 19, 1991, Monday         An obituary on Aug. 7 about Persis Emma Gladieux, a horticulture expert, omitted a surviving son. He is Russell V. Gladieux of Berne, N.Y.       
         Virginia Hoff Greenburg, a pianist, music teacher and co-founder of the prestigious Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale, N.Y., died on Friday at the Hospice of the Central Coast in Carmel, Calif. She was 91 years old.         She suffered a stroke at her home in Carmel on Sept. 14 and was in a coma until her death, family members said.         In 1944 she and the composer Joyce Barthelson founded the school with a few students in a private house in Scarsdale. Over the years it grew to occupy various annexes throughout the town. In 1972, it moved into its current home, the 36-room former Scarsdale Inn.         The school, which is for many a hub of Westchester musical life, now has 65 faculty members and 1,200 students and gives more than 200 concerts and recitals yearly, including those by the Philharmonia Virtuosi and the pianist Peter Serkin. It also has an extensive outreach program serving the elderly and the handicapped. Still Playing Near the End         Mrs. Greenburg was the director and driving force at the school for nearly 30 years before retiring in 1973, turning over its direction to Mary Helton, who had taught there since 1951.         Her first husband, Charles Hoff, died in 1949. In 1972, she married Reginald Greenburg. Soon after, they went to Carmel for a visit and soon moved there.         An accomplished pianist as well as teacher, she and Ms. Barthelson gave many two-piano recitals at the school and elsewhere. Even as her health began to fail in recent years, she kept playing. Shortly after her 90th birthday, she recorded herself performing Chopin Preludes and sent tapes to many relatives and friends.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Her sons, Hubert and Christopher, both died in 1974.         A memorial service at the school is being planned for next month.       
         Emily M. Rosenthal, the director of the 92d Street Y nursery school from 1946 to 1966, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Rosenthal, who lived in the Salvation Army Williams Residence in Manhattan, died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Omus Hirshbein, vice chairman of the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92d Street Y.M.H.A., said yesterday that Miss Rosenthal "was an extraordinary woman in the sense that she brought a cultured aspect of the Old World that is gone today, and passed that on to many generations of kids."         She was widely credited with doing much to shape and develop the school, which was founded in 1938.  Handicraft From Rubble         Miss Rosenthal, a German refugee, came to New York after teaching in England. At a Y nursery school celebration in 1981, Janet Fisher, one of its vice presidents, recalled that in England Miss Rosenthal had turned bomb shelters into nurseries, showing children how to make handicraft items from milk cartons and other materials found in the air-raid rubble.         "She did the same thing here at the Y with found objects," Mrs. Fisher recalled. "She made magic out of nothing."         Miss Rosenthal was born in the city of Krefeld in Germany, attended school in Bonn and graduated from a teacher training college in Frankfurt. She went on to teach at a girls' school in Krefeld and later became the director of a municipal kindergarten there.         In 1939, she fled Germany through the Netherlands to Britain, and in late 1940 she joined her mother and a brother in the United States. She held various teaching posts in New York before becoming director of the nursery school at the Y. After retiring from the school, she taught adult arts and crafts at the Y into the 1970's.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Minna Citron, a painter and printmaker best known for her Social Realist images of New York City, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a long illness, said her granddaughter Christiane Citron of Denver.         Mrs. Citron, whose maiden name was Wright, was born in Newark on Oct. 15, 1896, and grew up in Brooklyn. She began to study art as a diversion in the 1920's when she was living in Brooklyn, married and the mother of two sons. By 1928, she was studying at the Art Students League with John Sloan and Kenneth Hayes Miller, whose satirical depictions of city life influenced her own style. She had her first solo exhibition in 1930 at the New School for Social Research.         By 1934, she was divorced and working in a studio on Union Square. She soon became associated with a loosely knit group of Realist painters known as the 14th Street school, who included Moses and Raphael Soyer and Isabel Bishop. In the late 1930's she taught art and painted murals for the Works Progress Administration. In the early 1940's, she changed to abstraction, which remained her primary style for the rest of her life.         Mrs. Citron had many exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad; her most recent show in New York City was held last year at the Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo. Her work is represented in many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, and the National Museum of American Art and the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         She is survived by her sons, Casper, of Manhattan a radio and television commentator, and Tom, of Short Hills., N.J.; seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
