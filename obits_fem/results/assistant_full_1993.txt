         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Rita Ford, a dealer in antique and current music boxes with a wide array of musical sounds that enchanted visitors to her Manhattan shop for more than four decades, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         Her physician, Dr. Thomas Fabry, said the cause was complications of fluid in the lungs.         Under her guidance, Rita Ford Music Boxes at 19 East 65th Street, has become a New York institution and a veritable museum of melodious boxes. Mrs. Ford used to say her shop was one of a kind because it was the only shop that sold old and new music boxes, made music boxes to order and also restored them.         Among her customers were Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, the late Richard Rodgers, Beverly Sills and many other personalities in the entertainment and music world. A foreign client was the King of Saudi Arabia, who had made 20 matching music boxes playing the Saudi national anthem.         At her shop, Mrs. Ford would give personal tours of her treasure boxes, which ranged from 18th-century French mechanical figures that tinkled and trilled to modern Japanese boxes shaped like grand pianos playing the "Chariots of Fire" theme. The star of her collection was a Swiss-made mahogany box, circa 1887, which once belonged to Alec Templeton, with eight cylinders each playing six melodies including Strauss's "Blue Danube" waltz, "Comin' Thru the Rye" and "La Marseillaise," priced at $75,000. Born in Northeastern Italy         Retiring in 1990, she sold the music box shop to her assistant in restoration, Gerald Wright, who has preserved the name and character of the establishment.         Born in Fano, in northeastern Italy, she immigrated to the United States with her family when she was 6. The family changed its name from Romagna to Romania and settled on Fishers Island, N.Y.         At 19, she became a registered nurse and started out as a social worker in Hartford. During World War II, she married Albert Ford, an entrepreneur in New York City, and learned about antiques by visiting galleries.         Surviving is a niece, Nancy Young of Starr, S.C.       
         Elizabeth Hannah Waters, a modern dancer and choreographer who performed with Hanya Holm's company in the 1930's and who founded the dance program at the University of New Mexico, died on June 5 at her home in Echo Canyon, N.M.

         Florence Small Gaynor, the first black woman to head a major teaching hospital in the United States, died on Sept. 16 at Christiana Medical Center in Newark, Del. She was 72.         She died unexpectedly after a sudden brain hemorrhage, said her son, Wardell.         Mrs. Gaynor, a registered nurse by training, rose through the ranks of administration at several large New York hospitals at a time when there were few women or blacks in such positions. In February 1971, she was chosen from a field of 20 candidates, the rest of them male, to be executive director of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, making her the first black woman ever to head one of the city's municipal hospitals.         Eighteen months later she accepted a job in New Jersey, as executive director of Martland Hospital in Newark, a 600-bed teaching hospital operated by the state's medical school. Now part of the the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, it was then the state's largest hospital. Struggle to Become Nurse         Born in Jersey City, the fourth of six girls, Mrs. Gaynor fought racial barriers from the time she graduated from high school, at the age of 15, to get training to become a nurse. The first nursing school where she applied, at Jersey City Medical Center, turned her down because it did not admit blacks.         She worked at a doll factory and at an electric plant to help support her family and then applied the nursing school at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated as a registered nurse in 1946 and worked first at Queens General Hospital.         After a stint as a public-health nurse in East Harlem for New York City's Health Department, she worked as head nurse at Francis Delafield Hospital in Washington Heights and as a school nurse with the Board of Education in Newark.         At the same time she was pursuing a bachelor's degree in nursing and then a master's degree in public health at New York University. She spent the summer of 1965 at the University of Oslo in Norway studying the Scandinavian health system.         When she returned, she pursued a career in hospital administration, starting in the pediatrics department of Lincoln Hospital, which is staffed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. After a series of promotions, she was named assistant administrator in 1970.         After heading Sydenham Hospital and Martland Hospital, she left the Northeast to serve from 1976 to 1980 as director of hospital and health services at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school that has produced many of the nation's black doctors.         From 1980 until 1984, she was director of the West Philadelphia Community Mental Health Consortium in Philadelphia. For two years, before she retired in Wilmington, Del., she worked again as a school nurse, in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Wardell Michael Gaynor of Brooklyn and Matthew Small Gaynor of Cincinnati; a daughter, Brenda L. Gainer of Wilmington; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Thompson MacDonald, the founder of Recording for the Blind, a nonprofit organization that has put more than 80,000 books on tapes for blind and learning-disabled students since 1948, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Huntington, L.I. She was 96 and had lived in Manhattan.         She died in her sleep, said her daughter, Anne Thomas.         Mrs. MacDonald started the recording service while working for the Women's Auxiliary of the New York Public Library. She was inspired by a program that provided recordings for blind veterans attending college on the G.I. Bill of Rights.         She established a recording studio in a two-room office on West 44th Street in 1951 and became president of Recording for the Blind in 1952. That year, she persuaded friends to establish other studios in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Athens, Ga. Volunteer for Several Groups         The organization, now based in Princeton, N.J., has grown to 32 studios in 16 states, with about 4,000 volunteers making recordings of fiction and nonfiction books for students from the fifth grade to graduate school. Last year, about 33,000 people requested copies of the recordings.         Mrs. MacDonald began working as a volunteer for several organizations during World War II. She was appointed assistant director of the Nurses' Aide Corps of the American Red Cross in 1942 and later helped set up a program to house and feed British soldiers released from Japanese prison camps who stopped in New York on their way home.         In May 1988, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University for her volunteer work.         She was the wife of Ranald H. MacDonald, a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, who died in 1988.         She is survived by her son, Ranald H. Jr. of Denver; her daughter, Anne M. Thomas of Locust Valley, L.I.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Mary C. Lawton, the Justice Department official in charge of foreign intelligence surveillance, died on Monday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 58.         A department official said the cause was a pulmonary embolism.         As counsel for intelligence policy and head of the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Ms. Lawton's primary responsibility was to review foreign intelligence surveillance requests and to represent the department before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The court was established in 1978 to rule on Government applications for surveillance and wiretaps in foreign intelligence cases.         She was involved in the approval of wiretaps used to investigate the bombing last February of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.         In 1983, Ms. Lawton headed an intelligence panel that called for tighter security provisions, but the provisions have yet to be approved. She also represented the department at many Congressional hearings, opposing legislative intrusion into the Government's control of intelligence security and proposals to require polygraph tests for security clearances.         After graduating first in her class at the Georgetown Law Center in 1960, she began her career as a lawyer in the Office of Legal Counsel. She became a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in 1972 and was instrumental in drafting legislation that led to the Freedom of Information Act.         After leaving the department in 1979 to become general counsel of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and then an administrative law officer in the White House, Ms. Lawton returned in 1982 to assume responsibility for intelligence policy.         In 1986, the Central Intelligence Agency awarded her its Agency Seal Medallion for her work on behalf of the intelligence agencies.         She is survived by a sister, Cathy Kenna of Sparta, N.J.       
         Genevieve Sanchez Klein, a former member of the New York State Board of Regents and an outspoken critic of sex education and busing to integrate schools, died on Monday at her home in Daytona, Fla. She was 79.         The cause was cancer of the brain and lungs, said Howard Hurwitz, a friend.         Ms. Klein was appointed to the regents board by the New York State Assembly in 1974, after working for nearly 30 years as a physical education instructor and administrator in New York City public schools.         She was chairwoman of the physical education department at Jamaica High School in Queens from the early 1960's until 1973, when she retired from the school system. Before that, she had taught at Bayside High School in Queens. Denied Re-Election         She was working an assistant professor of health at Lehman College of the City University of New York when she was appointed as the second woman ever to serve on the Board of Regents, which supervises all education in the state.         During her three-year term, she frequently voted in the minority to oppose measures on forced busing of children to further integration of schools. She also voted against a set of guidelines to help school districts select textbooks that dealt with sex or included profanity, saying the rules did not protect the right of parents to object to such material.         She sought re-election to a full seven-year term on the board in 1977, but she was defeated by a vote of 108 to 99 by the Assembly, then controlled by Democrats.         After leaving the board, she was active in the anti-abortion movement and lectured on policy for public schools. She was also active in the Family Defense Council, a group based in Queens that campaigned against curriculum changes advocated by former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. She moved to Daytona in 1990.         Ms. Klein graduated from New York University in 1936 and received a master's degree in education from Colorado State College of Education in 1937.         She is survived by two sons, John F., of Orange Park, Fla., and James V., of Bellmont, Calif; a sister, Muriel Zeigler, of Malverne, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980
