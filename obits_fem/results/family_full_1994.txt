         May Nora Shea, a volunteer worker and supporter of diverse causes, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai South Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was a respiratory ailment, her family said.         Mrs. Shea was a native of Brooklyn and attended Trinity College in Washington. In 1937 she married William A. Shea, a New York lawyer who became a partner in Shea & Gould, founded the Mets baseball team and for whom Shea Stadium is named. Mr. Shea died in 1991 after 54 years of marriage.

         Susan Lehman Cullman, a New York philanthropist who served as a Navy cryptographer in World War II, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 79 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cullman graduated from Horace Mann School in 1932, then attended Vassar College for two years and graduated from New York University in 1962. During the war, she worked in the office of Adm. Thomas A. Hart as a decoder of Japanese messages. For many years, she edited the Cipher Exchange for Cryptogram Magazine.         Mrs. Cullman was the grandniece of the late Herbert H.

         Lynne Murray Johnson, the wife of Belton Kleberg Johnson, an heir to the King Ranch in Kingsville, Tex., died on Sunday at her home in San Antonio. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said Janette Ganster, a spokeswoman for the Johnson family.         Mrs. Johnson was born in Narromine, Australia, and moved to Mexico, where she was married to Ricardo Penafiel, an industrialist, who is deceased. She moved to San Antonio in the mid-1980's and married Mr. Johnson in 1990.         She is survived by her husband; her mother, Sadie Murray, and her brother, Paul Murray, both of Newport Beach, Australia.       
         Ruth Pruyn Field, a director of the Field Foundation who was active in civic causes in New York, died on Tuesday at her home in Beaufort, S.C. Mrs. Field, who was 86, also kept a home in Southport, Conn.         The cause was an aneurysm, her family said.         Mrs. Field was the widow of Marshall Field 3d, the publisher and philanthropist, who died in 1956. During their marriage, they both became involved in civic affairs. For many years, her principal interest lay in the Field Family Foundation, which contributed millions to charities promoting child welfare and improved race relations.         A native of Manhattan, Mrs. Field was also a past director of the Citizens Committee for Children in New York City, and the United Nations Association U.S.A. In addition, she was associated with the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Foundation, the Carnegie Hall Corporation, Sarah Lawrence College -- of which she was an honorary trustee -- the Wiltwyck School, the Advisory Committee for the Dalton Schools and the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.         Mrs. Field is survived by a son, Robert L. Phipps of Ridgeland, S.C.; a daughter, Fiona F. Kay, a resident of Alicante province in eastern Spain, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Joers Firestone, a philanthropist and civic leader in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died at her home there on Dec. 28. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said Bob Troyer, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Firestone was born in New York and graduated from Miss Porter's School. She had lived in Bryn Mawr since the late 1940's and was active in many civic and social organizations. She served with the Red Cross in World War II.         She was the widow of Roger S. Firestone, an industrialist who was the fifth son of Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Roger Firestone died in 1970 at 57.         Mrs. Firestone is survived by a son, John D., of Washington; three daughters, Gay F. Wray and Susan F. Semegen of Paradise Valley, Ariz., and Cinda F. Fox of New York; a brother, Peter Joers of Hot Springs, Ark., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Erica Glaser Wallach, who spent five years in Communist prisons at the height of the cold war on espionage charges that the Soviet authorities later said were false, died on Dec. 22 in Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton, Va. She was 71.         She died of cancer, said Renee Glaser, a cousin.         In 1950, Mrs. Wallach was arrested in what was then East Berlin, where she had gone to seek information about Noel H. and Herta Field, an American couple who had reared Mrs. Wallach and who had been arrested in Prague. The arrests focused worldwide attention on Soviet rule in Eastern Europe.         At the time of her arrest, Mrs. Wallach was married to Robert R. Wallach, a captain in the United States Army, and was living with him and their two children in Paris. Death Sentence Commuted         Mrs. Wallach was held in East Berlin, then in Moscow, where she was tried for espionage, found guilty and given a death sentence that was later commuted to 15 years in prison. In 1954 the Fields were released from prison in Hungary. At the same time, Mr. Field's brother, Hermann, who had been held in Czechoslokavia on espionage charges, was also released.         Mrs. Wallach was released from a Siberian labor camp in 1955 when the Soviet authorities declared that she was innocent of the charges against her. They never explained their change of mind.         Ms. Glaser said Mrs. Wallach had been trapped in a series of intrigues complicated by the fact that she had once worked for the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, and later had briefly been a member of the Communist Party.         "The Soviets thought she was an American spy, while the Western authorities believed she was working for the Communists, and she was caught in the middle of conflicting political forces in postwar Europe," Ms. Glaser said.         After rejoining her family in Warrenton, Mrs. Wallach taught French and Latin at the Highland School for 18 years.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of Burke, Va., and a daughter, Madeleine W. de Heller of Bougy-Villars, Switzerland.       
         Emily Taft Douglas, a former United States Representative from Illinois, died on Friday at a nursing home in White Plains. She was 94 and had lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., since moving from Washington in 1986.         Mrs. Douglas was the widow of former Senator Paul H. Douglas, who represented Illinois from 1949 to 1966. But having served in the House from 1945 to 1947, she was the first American woman to precede a husband to Congress. Both were Democrats.         In the House, Mrs. Douglas became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and campaigned for the fledgling United Nations. She traveled in war-ravaged Europe and backed the relief efforts of the United Nations.         She introduced legislation for bookmobiles to bring library services to rural America, and such a bill eventually passed after her husband's election as the Hill-Douglas Act. Marched for Civil Rights         Mrs. Douglas was elected in 1944 after a campaign against isolationism and went to Washington as Representative-at-Large, representing Illinois as a whole. By 1946, the political climate had changed and her support of the Truman Administration's policies sank her bid for re-election.         During her husband's 18 years on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Douglas was an advocate of civil rights and marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Alabama. She was a representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other United Nations conferences. A Unitarian, she was also a moderator of the American Unitarian Association.         Mrs. Douglas was the author of "Appleseed Farm" (1948), a children's book; "Remember the Ladies" (1966), the story of women who helped shape America, and "Margaret Sanger" (1970), about the pioneer in family planning.         A native of Chicago, she was the daughter of Lorado Taft, the sculptor, and Ada Bartless Taft. After graduating from the University of Chicago, she studied acting.         Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, yesterday called the Douglases good partners and said, "Together, Emily and Paul Douglas contributed immensely to Illinois and the nation."         Paul Douglas died in 1976. Mrs. Douglas is survived by a daughter, Dr. Jean Taft Douglas Bandler of Manhattan, and two grandsons.         Correction:  February 3, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Emily Taft Douglas, a former Democratic Representive from Illinois, misstated the middle name of her mother, who died before her. She was Ada Bartlett Taft.       
         Hilda Simms, an actress best known for her starring role on Broadway in "Anna Lucasta," died on Sunday in Buffalo at the home of her sister Evelyn Sharp. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer of the pancreas, her sister said.         "Anna Lucasta" and Ms. Simms's performance in the title role created a stir when the play, written by Philip Yordan and produced by the American Negro Theater, moved from Harlem to Broadway in 1944. For the first time, American playgoers saw an all-black cast acting in a drama that did not deal with racial issues. Ms. Simms played a middle-class woman who falls into prostitution and tries to fight her way back to respectability. The Road to Broadway         Ms. Simms, whose original surname was Moses, was born in Minneapolis.  She was one of nine children and studied teaching at the University of Minnesota until lack of money forced her to leave.         In 1943, Ms. Simms moved to New York. She acted in radio dramas and joined the American Negro Theater, where she was in charge of sound effects, props and publicity.         After appearing as a Southern ingenue in "Three's a Family," she was cast in "Anna Lucasta," a play written for white actors. Although most of the cast members were amateurs, the play received strong reviews and moved to Broadway. In 1947 Ms. Simms went with the play when it moved to London. While in Britain, she married the American actor Richard Angerolla. (Her first marriage, to William Simms in 1941, ended in divorce.)         Under the name Julie Riccardo, she also sang in Paris nightclubs before returning to the United States in 1953 to make the film "The Joe Louis Story." Her other film role was in "The Black Widow" (1954).         She also appeared in "The Cool World" (1960), "Tambourines to Glory" (1963) and a revival of "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1970) in New York theaters. On television, she was in the series "The Nurses."         As the director of the creative arts program of the New York State division of human rights in the 60's, she focused attention on discrimination and the lack of roles for black actors in film and television. After earning a master's degree in education from City College, she worked for drug treatment programs in New York.         In addition to her sister Evelyn, she is survived by her husband, of Los Angeles; two brothers, Richard Ricco of Minneapolis and Emil Moses Jr. of Tucson, Ariz., and two other sisters, Laura Thompson of New Orleans and Rose Napue of Minneapolis.       
         Madelin Thayer Gilpatric, a volunteer for almost five decades for several nonprofit organizations in New York City and California, died last Thursday at New York Hospital. She was in her 80's.         The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, according to her family.         Mrs. Gilpatric was a founder and past vice president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of New York City. She also served on the board of the California Institute of Arts in Valencia for 36 years and of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City for 17 years.         In addition, she worked with the Lighthouse for the Blind, the American Cancer Society, the Institute for Religion and Psychology and the International Press Institute.         Mrs. Gilpatric, a graduate of Syracuse University, was the widow of Arthur Kudner, whose advertising agency bore his name. Her marriage to Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy Administration, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two brothers, Albert Thayer of Baldwin, L.I., and John Thayer of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Arthur Kudner of Grasonville, Md.; a daughter, Karyl McKay of Alanson, Mich., and six grandchildren.       
         Maria St. Just, an actress and longtime friend of Tennessee Williams, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was in her late 60's or early 70's, her family said.         The cause was heart failure brought on by severe rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter Natasha Grenfell.         Lady St. Just was born in Petrograd but was taken by her mother to London when she was an infant. Her father, a doctor, remained in the Soviet Union and was later executed. She studied ballet as a young girl, but a leg operation when she was 14 put an end to her plans for a dancing career.         She won a scholarship to study at the Old Vic, after which she joined John Gielgud's company.         In 1948, before the company embarked on a foreign tour, she attended a party given by Mr. Gielgud in honor of Williams. A lifelong friendship with the playwright ensued. Lady St. Just was a co-executor of Williams's estate, and in 1990 she published "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982" (Alfred A. Knopf).         She appeared in the film "Room With a View" (1985) and in "Maurice" (1987), which was filmed at her estate near Salisbury.         In 1956 she married Peter Grenfell, the son of a British partner of J. P. Morgan. In 1973 Grenfell became a peer. He died in 1984.         In addition to her daughter Natasha, of London, she is survived by another daughter, Pulcheria, of Orleans, France, and two granddaughters.       
         Marjorie Keller Sitney, an independent film maker whose works have been shown at museums, festivals and film institutes around the world, died on Thursday in Winter Haven, Fla. She was 43 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.         The cause has not been determined, said her family, whom she was visiting.         Ms. Keller, married to the film scholar P. Adams Sitney but known by her maiden name, began exhibiting films in 1969. Among them are "Misconception" (1977), "Daughters of Chaos" (1980) and "Herein" (1992). She has had one-woman shows at the Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives in New York City. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the New York Film Makers' Cooperative.         Ms. Keller was a teacher and lecturer at the University of Rhode Island, the San Francisco Art Institute and other institutions. Her book "The Untutored Eye: Childhood in the Films of Jean Cocteau, Joseph Cornell and Stan Brakhage," was published in 1985.         In addition to her husband and her parents, Clarence and Nellie Keller, she is survived by twin daughters, Augusta Nell and Miranda Hope; a stepson, Blake; a stepdaughter, Skye; four sisters, Jacquelyn Gilbert and Barbara Wilkens, both of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; Patricia Button of Peeksill, N.Y., and Sarah Ann Filippini of Reston, Va., and two brothers, Clarence Christian Keller Jr. of Golden, Colo., and Stephen Lee Keller of Newark, Ohio.       
         Margaret Lane, the Dowager Countess of Huntingdon, a British author whose works included books about Peter Rabbit's creator, Beatrix Potter, died last Monday in Southampton, England. She was 86 and lived outside Southampton.         Miss Lane's two biographies of Miss Potter were the basis of "The Tale of Beatrix Potter," a two-part BBC dramatization shown on "Masterpiece Theater" on WNET in 1984 that was praised as a simple yet intense story with just the right touches of unflinching reserve.         Miss Lane's two books, "The Tale of Beatrix Potter: a Biography" (1946, Warne and Viking Penguin) and "The Magic Years of Beatrix Potter" (1978), were praised last week in the London newspaper The Independent as enriched by Miss Lane's own "exquisite sympathy with animals."         When "The Tale of Beatrix Potter" was published in the United States, it was lauded for its deep understanding of Miss Potter, who helped Miss Lane with the book, and for its vivid depiction of Miss Potter walking the hills and moors, gathering material for stories and pictures.         Miss Lane's 1975 book "Samuel Johnson and his World" has been called one of the very best modern works on Johnson. Her 1953 book about the writer Charlotte Bronte and members of her family, "The Bronte Story," won praise as an outstanding literary biography. And her 1965 novel "A Night at Sea" was lauded for its poignancy and narrative suspense.         Her other books -- she wrote more than two dozen, all told -- included "A Calabash of Diamonds" (1961), a personal account of an African safari; "Purely for Pleasure" (1967), a collection of essays, and "The Day of the Feast" (1968), a novel. She also wrote children's books.         The daughter of a journalist, Miss Lane studied at St. Hugh's College of Oxford University, worked as a reporter for some years and went on to become a critic as well as an author.         Her 1934 marriage to Bryan Wallace, son of the writer Edgar Wallace, was dissolved in 1939. In 1944 she was married to the 15th Earl of Huntingdon, a mural painter, and he died in 1990. They had two daughters.       
         Ida Parkinson Bruce, a ballet dancer who performed in this country in the 1920's, died on Sunday at the Pine Run Health Center in Doylestown, Pa. She was 93 and lived in Greenwich, Conn., and Palm Beach, Fla., before she moved to Doylestown in 1984.         She had a long illness, her family said.         She trained in her native England as a classical dancer and came to this country after World War I with Beatrice Lilly and Charlot's Theatrical Revue. She performed with that company and others across the United States.         In the late 1930's, she married Leslie Combs Bruce, a Wall Street financier. He died in 1989.         She is survived by three sons, Peter Harrison of Radnor, Pa., Charles Harrison of Pittsburgh and Douglas A. Bruce of Greenwich; a daughter, Elizabeth Morgan of Princeton, N.J.; a stepson, Leslie Combs Bruce 3d of San Diego; a stepdaughter, Julia Bruce Coyle of Greenwich; 17 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; 8 step-grandchildren, and 8 step-great-grandchildren.       
         Grace Roosevelt McMillan, a photographer who was the eldest grandchild of President Theodore Roosevelt, died on Tuesday at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. She was 82 and lived in Baltimore.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Born Grace Green Roosevelt in San Francisco, she graduated from the Sorbonne in Paris and became an accomplished freelance photographer. She was a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. During World War II she managed the large McMillan family farm in Maryland while her husband served in the Navy in the Pacific.         She was the only daughter of Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., a soldier, author and publisher, who died in the cross-Channel assault on Omaha Beach in 1944. A highly decorated officer and former Governor of Puerto Rico, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.         Mrs. McMillan is survived by her husband of 60 years, William, a retired architect; a daughter, Eleanor McMillan of Bethesda, Md.; a son, William Jr., of Baltimore; a brother, Theodore Roosevelt 3d of Mount Desert, Me., and three granddaughters.       
         Willie Mae Ford Smith, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Wednesday at the Tower Village Nursing Home in St. Louis. She was 89.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and her recording producer.         Mother Smith, as she was widely known, was one of the first singers to perform in the blues-influenced gospel style created by Thomas A. Dorsey in the 1920's and 30's. Her deep contralto and flamboyant vocal flights made her a leading performer of the 1930's and 40's, and she was a major influence on singers like Mahalia Jackson.         Willie Mae Ford was born in Rolling Fork, Miss., 1 of 14 children in a musical family. She moved to St. Louis at the age of 12, and sang with family members in the Ford Sisters. In 1927, she married James Peter Smith and began a career as a soloist.         She started working with Dorsey's National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in the early 1930's, and she became the director of the convention's Soloist's Bureau, evaluating and training gospel singers until the late 1980's. During the 1930's and 40's, she constantly toured the Midwest with her adopted daughter, Bertha, as accompanist. But while her style and showmanship were widely imitated, she did not make her first recording until 1950. She later recorded albums for the Nashboro, Savoy and Spirit Feel labels.         In 1972 she began to receive national recognition after an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. She appeared in the 1981 gospel documentary film "Say Amen, Somebody," and received a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. She continued to perform regularly at the Lively Stone Apostolic Church in St. Louis until the early 1990's.         She is survived by her sisters Emma, Geneva and Georgie; a daughter, Jacqueline; a son, William; four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, all of St. Louis.       
         Dorette Kruse Fleischmann, a civic leader and socialite in New York and Cincinnati, died yesterday at the Racquet Club in Chicago. She was 88.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Joan Tobin.         She and her husband, Julius Fleischmann, whose family made its fortune through yeast, were benefactors of many cultural and civic groups, including the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Opera and the Council on Foreign Affairs.         Mrs. Fleischmann graduated from Smith College in 1927.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Charles Fleischmann 3d of Cincinnati; another daughter, Dorette Fleischmann of The Plains, Va.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick.         Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.         Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.         Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins. Youth in Hollywood and London         Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."         After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.         Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.         She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.       
         Elsa Victoria Lorne Harvey, chief executive of Lorne-Harvey Publications in Larchmont, N.Y., died on Tuesday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 62 and lived in Larchmont.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Harvey, known as Vicki, grew up in New York City, the daughter of Swedish immigrants. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of City College.         Earlier in her career she worked as advertising director of Harvey World Famous Comics Inc., which had been founded by her future husband, Alfred Harvey. The company dealt with such titles as Blondie, Dick Tracy and Casper, the Friendly Ghost.         Lorne-Harvey Publications was formed in 1988 to re-issue some of her husband's earliest characters. These included the Black Cat. Company officials said a Black Cat motion picture is being prepared for production in Los Angeles by Motion PIcture Corporation of America.         Mrs. Harvey is survived by her husband; four sons, Alan, of Larchmont, Russel, of Manhattan, Adam, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Eric, of Larchmont; a stepdaughter, Shulamis Bush of Brooklyn; a sister, Ruth Korten of Winter Park, Fla.; a brother, Eric Lorne Sr. of Inverness, Fla., and three stepgrandchildren.       
         Francine Strickler-Greenspan, a former president of the Saxon Textile Corporation in Manhattan's TriBeCa area, died yesterday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was a brain tumor, her family said.         A graduate of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Strickler-Greenspan spent over 25 years with Saxon Textile, a firm founded by her parents, and became one of the first women to reach a top-level position in her industry. The company dyes and finishes twills, poplins and nylons for manufacturers. She served as its president from 1980 until her illness.         She is survived by her husband, Julian Greenspan; two daughters, Gail W. Strickler and Debbye Strickler, both of Manhattan, and a son, Dr. Howard Strickler of Washington.       
         Mai Zetterling, the Swedish actress who went on to a career as one of Europe's busiest female film directors, died on Tuesday in London. She was 68 and had homes in London and in Banne, France.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, Joyce Edwards.         Ms. Zetterling was directing the film "The Woman Who Cleaned the World," which she had written, when she died.         Mai Elisabeth Zetterling was born in Vasteras, Sweden, to a working-class family. She left school barely literate, according to her 1985 autobiography, "All Those Tomorrows."         After working in a drug store and a mail-order company, she tried acting and was invited to join the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her stage and screen debuts when she was 17. Breakthrough in 'Torment'         Her sensitive portrayal of a simple girl victimized by a sadistic professor in "Torment" (released in the United States in 1947), created a sensation and is now considered a landmark of the Swedish cinema. The film, directed by Alf Sjoberg and written by Ingmar Bergman, was released under the title "Frenzy" in England and made her an international star.         She also appeared in "Frieda" (1947), "Desperate Moment" (1953), "Knock on Wood" with Danny Kaye (1954), "A Prize of Gold" with Richard Widmark (1955), "Abandon Ship!" with Tyrone Power (1957), "Only Two Can Play" with Peter Sellers (1961), "The Vine Bridge" (1965), "The Witches" (1990) and "Hidden Agenda" (1990).         In the 1960's and 1970's she was one of the few women who found regular work as a director. Her first effort, "The War Game" (1963), a short documentary, won a first prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Many of her subsequent films dealt explicitly with female sexuality and focused on the role of women in society.         Among her directorial credits are "Loving Couples" (1964), "Night Games" (1966), "Doctor Glas" (1968), "The Girls" (1969), "Vincent the Dutchman" (1975), "Lady Policeman" (1979), "Of Seals and Men" (1979) "Scrubbers" (1983) and "Amorosa" (1986).         In later years she continued acting, co-starring with Anjelica Huston in Nicholas Roeg's 1990 film "The Witches."         Ms. Zetterling also wrote children's books, short stories and novels, one of which, "Night Games," she adapted and directed for the screen.         Her two marriages, to Tutte Lemkow, a Norwegian dancer, and the novelist David Hughes, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son and a daughter from her first marriage.       
         Raquel Adonaylo, a soprano who was on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, died on Tuesday at her home in Rosemont, Pa. She was 67.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Rony Rogoff, a family friend.         An accomplished pianist, Miss Adonaylo gave recitals and appeared with orchestras in her native Uruguay before devoting herself to her singing career. She studied voice in France in the early 1950's and later performed in recitals, in chamber concerts and as a soloist with orchestras. She sang many major roles in operas produced by Uruguay's Symphony Orchestra.         In 1960, she was invited to perform the premiere of Ginastera's "Cantata para America Magica" in Washington, a work she later recorded for Columbia Records. In 1963 she moved from Uruguay to Israel, where she sang with the Israel Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta and other conductors. She was also a regular participant at the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont and toured with Musicians From Marlboro. In 1975 she moved to the United States and joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute, where she taught until 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Jacko Peniazek; a daughter, Ana, and two sons, Pablo and Eduard, all of Rosemont.       
         Sayra Fischer Lebenthal, a Wall Street legend who was a co-founder in 1925 of the investment-banking firm of Lebenthal & Company and remained active in it for 67 years, died on Thursday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lebenthal was a newlywed when she and her husband, Louis S. Lebenthal, set up shop in a tiny office with second-hand furniture and no rugs. They sought their niche as bond traders and found it.         Bonds had been around since Colonial times, when they were used to finance militias, but in 1925 they were still considered an investment for millionaires. The new firm spotted an opening that had been missed by others: they looked for odd lots of small-denomination bonds from estates and other neglected sources and offered them to relatively modest savers.         The company thrived, continuing to do so after the death of Louis Lebenthal in 1951. Mrs. Lebenthal, grieving, decided to stay in business. She specialized in tax-exempt municipal bonds for small investors, and watched the market for them soar.         For years, she put in full workweeks checking the day's municipal offerings and dealing with clients by telephone until, at 92, a fall put her in failing health. She had already begun to delegate management control in thge 1980's and disposed of her majority holding in the firm about four years ago.         A native of Keyport, N.J., she graduated from Syracuse University Law School and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1923. Set to practice law, she married Mr. Lebenthal in 1925 and he persuaded her to go into a partnership as bond traders.         Mrs. Lebenthal was remarried in 1956 to I. Arnold Ross, a lawyer and former State Assemblyman. He died in 1981. She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Lebenthal Bissinger of Manhattan; a son, Jim Lebenthal, the firm's chairman and spokesman, also of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Gordon G. Wallace, a sociologist and expert on women's reproductive health, died on Thursday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. She was 75.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Patricia Sears, a spokeswoman for Population Action International, a research group in Washington.         Since 1980 Dr. Wallace had been the director of the African women's health project at Population Action International and was an authority on female genital mutilation.         She was also a member of the boards of family planning, environmental and civic organizations. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and in 1942 received a doctorate in sociology from Yale University.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Robert W. Wallace of Washington, and three sons, Randall, of Manhattan, Scott, of Washington, and Bruce, of Tinicum Township, Pa.       
         Elinor Rice Hays, a biographer and novelist, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 92 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was complications from a stroke she suffered several months ago, Prof. Harvey J. Goldschmid, a family friend, said.         A native of Manhattan, Mrs. Hays was a 1923 graduate of Barnard College. She published several successful novels under her maiden name. Her first one, "The Best Butter" (1938), a light novel, became a best seller. It was followed by "Action in Havana" (1940) and "Mirror, Mirror" (1946).         She later turned to biography. "Morning Star: A Biography of Lucy Stone, 1818-1893" (1961) portrayed the suffragette leader and bitter rival of Susan B. Anthony as head of the American Woman Suffrage Association. It remains in print. "Those Extraordinary Blackwells" (1967) was the story of a family of 19th-century reformers in England, including Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to become a fully accredited physician there.         Mrs. Hays also contributed to magazines, including The New Yorker, Seventeen and Glamour.         Mrs. Hays was married to Paul R. Hays in 1949. Mr. Hays, a judge of the United States Circuit Court, died in 1980. She is survived by a niece, Jacqueline Wrubel Savits of Rockville, Md., and a nephew, Paul R. Wrubel of Half Moon Bay, Calif.       
         Margery Beukema Leonard, who was a civic leader and charity volunteer in Seattle, died on Monday in Fort Belvoir, Va., at the Fairfax Retirement Community's health care center. She was 77 and had moved to Fort Belvoir in 1989 after 24 years in Seattle.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Leonard was born in Laredo, Tex., and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1937. She was a volunteer worker for the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association.         She is survived by her husband, Charles F. Leonard Jr., a retired major general; three sons, Michael, of Washington, Col. Henry A., of Fort Riley, Kan., and Prof. Herman B., of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Margaret L. Starbird of Tacoma, Wash.; a sister, Alice B. Miller of Fort Belvoir, 13 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Lynn Solotaroff, a translator from Russian and a teacher, died on Monday at the Jewish Home & Hospital in New York. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer and emphysema, her family said.         Mrs. Solotaroff was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from the University of Michigan and studied Russian as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and Columbia University. At Columbia she became a visiting scholar at the Russian Institute -- now Harriman Institute -- and worked as its director of publications from 1977 to 1985.         Among the books she translated was Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyitch" (1981). She also contributed to Avraham Yarmolinsky's translation of "Letters of Anton Chekhov" (1973), and most recently was working on her own edition and translation of Chekhov's stories.         For the last several years she also taught English as a second language at City College and Touro College.         Mrs. Solotaroff is survived by two sons, Paul, of Boston, and Ivan, of Manhattan; and two sisters, Bernice Silverstein of River Edge, N.J., and Sydelle Corwin of Potomac, Md. Her marriage to Ted Solotaroff ended in divorce.       
         Dr. Edith Porada, a Columbia University art historian and archeologist, died on Thursday in Honolulu, where she was staying with her sister. She was 81 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She suffered a brief illness, said Sidney Babcock, a family spokesman in New York.         At her death, Dr. Porada was Arthur Lehman professor emeritus of art history and archeology at Columbia and honorary curator of seals and tablets at the Pierpoint Morgan Library. She joined the Columbia faculty in 1958 and was named a senior lecturer when she reached emeritus status 10 years ago.         She also remained active at the Morgan Library where she held regular graduate seminars as recently as last December. Columbia University established an Edith Porada professorship of ancient Near Eastern art history and archeology in 1983 with a $1 million gift from an anonymous donor.         A native of Vienna, Dr. Porada received a doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1935 and arrived in this country three years later. Before Columbia, she held positions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Queens College Art Department.         One of the world's leading authorities on ancient cylinder seals, she organized and directed Columbia's excavations on the Phlamoudhi plain near the Mediterranean in northeastern Cyprus in the early 1970's. Digging on a remote hill, the explorers found a sanctuary of the Hellenistic period and evidence of close commercial ties between Cyprus and the Greek islands in the late Bronze Age, about 1500 B.C.         Dr. Porada is survived by her sister, Hildegard Randolph.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Dr. Kathryn Frederick Clarenbach, a founding member and the first chairwoman of the National Organization for Women, died on Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 73.         The cause was complications from emphysema, her family said.         Dr. Clarenbach, known as Kay, was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, where she earned her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in that subject. She taught in Indiana, New York and Michigan before returning to Madison to teach at the University of Wisconsin and Edgewood College. She retired in 1988.         A native of Sparta, Wis., she worked for many years on the university's program of continuing education for women. For 13 years, she headed Wisconsin's Commission on the Status of Women, helping to shape changes in the laws on sexual assault, divorce and marital property.         On the national level, she was an organizer of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1966, she was a founder of NOW and led it with Betty Friedan, the organization's first president, until 1970.         Dr. Clarenbach is survived by two daughters, Sara Clarenbach of Madison, and Janet Mallon of Oswego, N.Y.; a son, David, of Madison, and one grandson.       
         Judith Schwartz, a designer of commercial and residential interiors in New York, died last Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Schwartz was active in community affairs as a trustee of the Park East Synagogue and a board member of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation. She established a Judith Schwartz scholarship fund at the Rabbi Arthur Schneier Park East Day School and served as a representative of the Women's International Zionist Organization to the United Nations.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated from Finch College, trained at New York School of Interior Design and received a degree in decorative arts at Parsons School of Design. She headed Better Home Furnishing Company from 1965 to 1981, when she established J.R.S. Interiors Inc., her current firm in Manhattan.         Mrs. Schwartz is survived by her husband of 30 years, Stanley; two daughters, Blair and Kim; her mother, Blanche Rosenzweig Levine of Bal Harbour, Fla.; a sister, Carol Nussbaum of Charleston, S.C., and a brother, Lawrence Rosenzweig of Manhattan and Bal Harbour.       
         Alice Herrington, the founder and longtime president of Friends of Animals, one of the country's best known animal-protection societies, died on Tuesday at DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. Ms. Herrington, a former resident of Manhattan and Little Silver, N.J., was 75 and lived in Lithonia, Ga.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         She founded the nonprofit organization in Manhattan in 1957 and retired as its president at the end of 1986. It now has headquarters in Darien, Conn., and counts 150,000 contributing members nationwide.         When she started Friends of Animals, its purpose was to protect cats and dogs. To that end it offered low-cost spaying and neutering services to cut down the number of strays across the country. The organization eventually built its own clinic for this in Neptune, N.J.         Under her leadership the society widened its activities to preserve animals in general, including wildlife, marine mammals and zoo animals. Ms. Herrington pursued her cause in letters to the editor, advertisements, Op-Ed articles, lectures and public testimony. Panel for Humane Legislation         Her targets included the killing of seals and their pups for fur; leg-hold traps for catching raccoons for their coats; hunters who paid thousands of dollars to shoot polar bears from the air; rodeos in which electric rods, bucking straps and steel spurs are used on broncos and bulls, and cruel uses of animals for experiments, research and testing.         She also started and directed a Committee for Humane Legislation to require that animals be rendered unconscious and insensible to pain before slaughter. That campaign in the 1960's aroused controversy because it was aimed at the shackling and hoisting method used by some kosher slaughterers.         Her disapproval of fur coats led to her arrest for disorderly conduct in 1979, when she took part in a protest outside Gracie Mansion. The occasion was a dinner given by Mayor Edward I. Koch for a group of furriers in town for a convention.         "Hunting is all part of the macho world," she once told an interviewer.  "You bring up your boys and suggest that to be a man like their father they should kill everything that moves, right?"         Ms. Herrington, a Wisconsin native, graduated from the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a daughter, Jennifer C. Schmid of Lawrenceville, Ga., and a sister, Rachel E. Brodeaux of Harlingen, Tex.       
         Elissa Ichiyasu, a graphic designer, died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on April 13. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, her family said.         A native of Chicago, Ms. Ichiyasu was a graduate of Columbia University and studied design at Pratt Institute. At her death she was a book designer for Harry N. Abrams Inc., an art-book publisher. She joined the company in January 1987 after working as an art director for Random House.         A show of her work is scheduled for the fall at the American Institute of Graphic Arts on Fifth Avenue.         Ms. Ichiyasu is survived by her husband, Michael Clancey; her father, Harry T. Ichiyasu, and a brother, Alan, both of Chicago.       
         Dr. Barbara Ann Liskin, a specialist in psychiatry for adolescents and young adults who was long associated with Columbia University, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 41 and lived in Ridgefield, N.J, where she had a private practice.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Until last fall, Dr. Liskin was director of Mental Health Services at Barnard College, an assistant professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and an assistant attending physician at Presbyterian Hospital. She previously served as director of Young Adult Psychiatry at Columbia.         A native of Englewood, N.J., she was a cum laude graduate of Smith College. She received her medical degree at Columbia, where she also received a master's degree in nutrition.         Dr. Liskin is survived by her husband, Dr. Vincent Bonagura; twin daughters Elizabeth and Rebecca; her parents, Anita and Louis Liskin of Englewood; two brothers, David, of Carmel, Calif., and Max, of Nashville, and two sisters, Diana Chapman of Tokyo and Alisa Clausen of Aabenraa, Jutland, Denmark.       
         Betty Furness, who went from minor acting roles to reknown as a television saleswoman and then became a formidable consumer advocate, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y.         The cause was stomach cancer, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         With the cheekbones of a model and the directness of a New England schoolmarm, Miss Furness was one of the true pioneers in television consumer journalism. In her heyday with WNBC-TV in New York, she regularly broadcast the names of errant businesses and shoddy products. She pointed television cameras at stores where New Yorkers had been cheated, and lectured the proprietors. She reported on hamburger that was too fat, on warranties that were too lean, on gadgets that were too temperamental and on business ethics that she saw as seriously flawed. She even scolded Macy's. Park Avenue Upbringing         Miss Furness essentially created a place for consumer advocacy on local television. She also spent a great deal of time off the screen promoting the cause of consumer justice. She was on the board of Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, from 1969 until she retired for health reasons in 1993, and she worked for Common Cause. She also was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs and was head of the New York State Consumer Protection Board in 1970 and '71. She was Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973.         Miss Furness, who had surgery for stomach cancer in 1990, was eased out of the "Today" show on NBC in 1992 after 16 years with the program. "This was their idea, not mine," she said dryly as she departed.         Miss Furness, whose original name was Elizabeth Mary Furness, was born on Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City, the daughter of George Choate Furness, an executive with what was then called Union Carbon and Carbide, and Florence Sturtevant Furness. The Furness family was well off and young Betty was raised on Park Avenue and sent to the Bennett School in Dutchess County, N.Y. In 1932, before graduating, she dropped out to become an actress.         It was the Depression, and her father had advised her to learn "something useful." She got summer jobs with the John Robert Powers Modeling Agency, but to her father's dismay earned only $80 in two summers of work. But she was blonde and trim, and Mr. Powers noticed her. He liked the way she used her voice and her gray-green eyes, and he arranged for her to take a screen test at RKO.         The only acting she had done was in school theatricals, but just a year after she left the Bennett School, RKO was touting her as a bright new talent. She had secondary roles in 35 films in Hollywood and later called them all appalling except "Swing Time," which starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and "Magnificent Obsession," both produced in the mid-1930's. She left the screen in 1937 and moved to the stage. With few exceptions -- the stock and road productions of "Golden Boy," "My Sister Eileen" and "Doughgirls" -- the career that had started with promise seemed to be going nowhere. Early TV Participant         In 1948, with commercial television just starting, Miss Furness landed a job with the DuMont Television Network, which signed her to do a 15-minute show called "Fashions, Coming and Becoming."         A year later, somebody at Westinghouse saw her in a "Studio One" drama and offered her a job as the company's representative on television. For more than 11 years Miss Furness was a staple on evening television, frequently standing in front of refrigerators and waxing eloquent about their performance.         In 1952, 1956 and 1960, Miss Furness did the Westinghouse commercials during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and developed a strong interest in politics. She worked for Abraham Ribicoff in Connecticut when he made his first successful race for the United States Senate in 1962. After meeting Lady Bird Johnson and Muriel Humphrey, she also made recruiting trips for Head Start and Vista, the Volunteers in Service to America. Left Rockefeller Job         In 1962, she was the hostess of a five-minute radio show called "A Woman's World," in which she talked about food, clothes, child rearing, family relationships, teen-agers and the aged. Late in 1962, she worked on an ABC-TV show called "Answering Service." The show was nominated for an Emmy Award, but ABC dropped her all the same.         Miss Furness abruptly quit as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's consumer affairs adviser in 1971, charging that the New York State Legislature did not take her recommendations seriously enough. She ran New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973. After that she worked briefly for McCall's magazine as a contributing editor and wrote a column for consumers.         Despite the number and diversity of her activities, she was never able to completely shake off her image as a product saleswoman. "I feel I'm a very serious person who wants to do things," she once said, "but people keep talking about refrigerators. I'm tired of telling the story about the refrigerator door that didn't stick, and I'm bored with the image."         In 1937 Miss Furness married Johnny Green, the composer and conductor, with whom she had a daughter, Barbara. The couple divorced in 1943. In 1945, she married Hugh B. Ernst, a radio announcer, who died in 1950. She married Mr. Midgley, a CBS News producer, in 1967.         In addition to her husband and her daughter, she is survived by three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Lois R. Murphy, an expert on environmental law and a partner in the New York law firm of Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was an acute respiratory incident, her family said.         She was a graduate of Pace University Law School, where she was editor in chief of the Environmental Law Review. She later served as assistant regional counsel of the New York Environmental Protection Agency. She joined Cahill, Gordon as an associate in 1988 and became a partner this January.         She is survived by her husband, Eugene Zuriff; her daughter, Jennifer Reisman of Atlanta; two stepsons, Laurence Zuriff of Washington and Bryan Zuriff of Los Angeles, and a sister, Judith, who lives in Florida.       
         Luba Potamkin, a broadcasting spokeswoman in the 1970's for her family's Cadillac auto dealerships on the East Coast, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 73.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Victor Potamkin.         Three years after her husband founded Potamkin Cadillac in 1972, Mrs. Potamkin and other members of her family appeared in television commercials that featured the line: "If this nameplate isn't on the back of your car, you probably paid too much."         The ebullient commercials, which were also broadcast by Potamkin dealerships on television stations in Pennsylvania and Florida, were noticed. Mr. Potamkin said his forceful merchandising in New York helped his sales.         Mrs. Potamkin, the former Luba Chalken, was born in Philadelphia. She was married to Victor for 52 years and for a large part of that time was content to be a wife and mother to her two sons.  Fighting Against Alzheimer's         She said of her career as a Cadillac spokeswoman on television, which she amplified to include health and fashion tips, that she never studied a script in advance. She told an interviewer in 1977, "To me, it's easy because it's my business and I'm thrilled to say, 'Buy a Cadillac.' "         Her son Alan recalled yesterday that the ad campaign was hatched by his father, who convinced his wife, who was at first reluctant, to do it.         The Potamkin family relinquished the dealership in 1987, selling the assets and leasing the company's Manhattan real estate to General Motors.  For several years the dealership fell into decline under new operators with a more muted television campaign.         Two years ago the Potamkin family resumed operations under the name Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet.         Mrs. Potamkin then became a symbol of the fight against Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed as having in the late 1970's. She and her husband made major donations to research into the disease, and in 1987 the Potamkin family created the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer Research, an annual award of $100,000. They were also active in sponsoring fund-raising events for medical research.         In addition to her husband, who maintains homes in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, she is survived by two sons, Robert, of Philadelphia and Alan, of Miami; a sister, Florence Jans of Miami; a brother, Marvin Chaiken of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
         Evan Burger Donaldson, president of the board of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children in New York, a nonprofit adoption service, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. Mrs. Donaldson, who lived in Manhattan, was 60.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said her husband, William H. Donaldson.         Mrs. Donaldson was also involved with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the New York Women's Association and the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy. She graduated from Vassar College.         She is survived by her husband, who is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, a daughter, Kimberly Donaldson-Plym, and a son, Matthew, all of New York.       
         Lil Picard, an artist and critic whose activities included painting, collage, film and performance as well as a stint as a designer of women's hats, died on Tuesday at her home. She was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of natural causes, said Jon Hendricks, a friend.         Ms. Picard was born Lilli Elizabeth Benedict in Landau, Germany, in 1899. After graduating from high school in Strasbourg, now in France, she studied art and literature in Berlin. She remained in Berlin, where she worked as a journalist and was friendly with members of the Berlin Dada group, including Richard Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, Emmy Hennings and Hugo Ball. In 1937 she moved to New York City and worked for a while as a hat designer, opening a millinery boutique at Bloomingdale's in 1942.         Ms. Picard began painting in 1939 and by the late 1940's was exhibiting paintings and collages in the 10th Street galleries. By 1960 she was making reliefs and tablets that often had an autobiographical, feminist focus. In the 1960's and 70's she became known for interactive performances and environments, which often occurred under the auspices of the New York Avant-Garde Festival. Her 1967 performance, "Construction-Destruction-Construction," at the Judson Church Gallery, was filmed by Andy Warhol.  One-Person Shows         Ms. Picard's first one-person show was at the David Anderson Gallery in 1960. In 1976 she had simultaneous exhibitions at Goethe House, the Ronald Feldman Gallery and the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York, and, in 1978, a retrospective at the Neue Berliner Kunstverein in Berlin.         Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Picard wrote on art for Interview and the East Village Other and was New York art correspondent for Kunstform International and Die Welt.         Ms. Picard's first marriage, to Fritz Picard, an antiquarian bookseller, ended in divorce in the late 1920's. In 1935 she married Hans Odell, a banker, who died in the late 1970's.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Julia Andrews Bissell, a patron of the arts and moving force in the restoration of the historic Kenmore mansion and museum in Fredericksburg, Va., died on Sunday at the Medical College of Georgia Hospital in Augusta. She was 87 and had homes in Chadds Ford, Pa., and Aiken, S.C.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Bissell, of the duPont family of Wilmington, Del., was also associated with the Winterthur Museum and Gardens near Wilmington. She was a past president and longtime member of the board of the Delaware Art Museum and a trustee of the Friends of American Art at Yale University.         Her patronage of Kenmore, a pre-Revolutionary Georgian mansion and one of the country's foremost house museums, spanned more than half a century. It was the home of Fielding Lewis, whose wife, Betty, was George Washington's only sister.         Kenmore, a rambling mansion, is noted for its interiors and period furnishings that are based on inventories taken in 1782 before the sale of the original contents. Over the years, Mrs. Bissell served as chairman of the collections and garden committees, chairman of the board of regents and, twice, as president of the board.         According to Vernon Edenfield, director of Kenmore, "through her gifts the collections were enriched and through her vast knowledge the museum grew and thrived."         In addition to her support for historic preservation, Mrs. Bissell was a noted horticulturist and expert in camellias, for which she won prizes at gardening competitions. Her winter home in Aiken, S.C. -- built in 1905 by her parents, James N. and Julia Sophie duPont Andrews -- is surrounded by woodland gardens.         Mrs. Bissell's husband, Alfred E., died in 1975. She is survived by three daughters, Julia B. Leisenring of Berwyn, Pa., Antonia B. Laird of Chadds Ford and Susan B. Parker of Smith's Parish, Bermuda; a sister, Anne A. Black of Keswick, Va.; 15 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Sister Ellen Lawlor, president of the Mercycare Corporation, which is operated by the Religious Sisters of Mercy, died on Monday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. Sister Lawlor, who lived in Albany, was 70.         The cause was cancer, said an announcement by her order.         Sister Lawlor was a member of the Albany Regional Community of the Religious Sisters of Mercy of the Americas for 48 years. She was president of St. Peter's Hospital for 23 years and president of the Mercycare Corporation since its inception in 1985.         She was the hospital's chief executive during the institution's greatest period of growth, which included the addition of an addiction recovery center, a hospice, family health centers and home health care outreach operations. Sister Lawlor was also instrumental in the creation of the Eastern Mercy Health System of 13 hospitals and nursing homes from Maine to Florida.         Before her involvement in health care, Sister Lawlor was a teacher and administrator at Catholic schools in Albany and Troy. She was a graduate of the College of St. Rose and received a master's degree in business administration from Xavier University in Cincinnati.         She is survived by one sibling, Sister Anne Lawlor, who is also a member of the Religious Sisters of Mercy in Albany, and a sister-in-law, Mary Lawlor of Des Plaines, Ill.       
         Jolene R. Marion, a New York lawyer who played a prominent role in the animal-rights movement, died on Sunday at the Queens home of a friend, Marilyn Mason. She was 53 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         At her death, she was an adjunct professor at the Pace University School of Law. She also continued to represent clients.         A native of Brooklyn, Ms. Marion began her animal-rescue work while an undergraduate at Queens College in 1970. She graduated from Seton Hall Law School in 1976 and became an insistent voice among advocates of animal-rights laws to ban leghold traps and other cruel practices.         She was associated with a number of organizations, including the Animal Legal Defense Fund and Legal Action for Animals. Much of her work was pro bono, with clients ranging from individual pet owners to humane organizations.         She is survived by her sister, Helena Pittman of Huntington, L.I.       
         Sondra B. Gair, a veteran broadcast journalist best known for her public-affairs talk show on Chicago radio, died on Wednesday in Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Chicago.         She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Gair was the executive producer of an hourlong program of world news and public affairs on WBEZ-FM, the National Public Radio affiliate in Chicago. Airing weekdays since 1986, "Midday with Sondra Gair" was conceived by her as a way to cover breaking news as she interviewed political leaders and journalists and encouraged callers to give their views.         Her topics ranged as widely as her selection of guests. She interviewed correspondents, policy experts and government leaders by telephone. She was respected for her fairness, for letting all sides have their say.         "She had a particular gift of intimacy with her listeners," said Carole Nolan, general manager of WBEZ and a longtime friend. "Sondra called the world, from the king of Greece to cabdrivers."         "Midday with Sondra Gair" went off the air in mid-March. In tribute, WBEZ fell silent for an hour yesterday after a brief eulogy by Ms. Nolan.         Sondra Gair was born in Cicero, Ill., and grew up in Chicago. She studied speech, acting and journalism at Northwestern University, which proclaimed her "Alumna of the Year" in 1992.         She began her radio career in the 1940's, appearing regularly in soap operas, dramas and comedy shows. But her interest in news reporting eventually made her to turn to broadcast journalism with on-site reports on the arts, politics and mores of England, China, the Netherlands, Mexico and Israel.         She joined WBEZ in 1975 and conducted various interview shows before beginning the midday program for which she was best known.         Ms. Gair is survived by a daughter, Patricia Sweeney of Kingston upon Thames, England; two sons, Judd Rose of Manhattan and Roger Rose of Los Angeles; her mother, Rose Gair of Chicago; a brother, Seymour Gair of suburban Chicago, and three grandchildren.       
         Harriet Gans, a photographer who showed her work in New York galleries and museums, died on Wednesday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Gans was a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and held a master's in psychology from Columbia University. At her death she was a professor of photography at Pace University.         She had solo exhibitions at the Julie Saul and Pindar Galleries in New York. She contributed studies of flowers to the In Bloom Traveling Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1990.         She was a regular contributor to magazines and The New York Times.         She is survived by her husband, Walter Gans; two sons, David of Scarsdale and Erik of Cambridge, Mass., and her mother, Mildred Goldhagen of Deerfield Beach, Fla.       
         Lois G. Forer, an author, a retired Philadelphia judge and a lifelong advocate for the young, the elderly and the poor, died on Monday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. A Philadelphia resident, she was 80.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         Judge Forer, an authority on criminal justice, spent 32 years practicing law and 16 years on the bench. Her books on the law received critical acclaim nationally.         She also headed a poverty law office for children, sat on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union and represented poor people in constitutional cases. As a private lawyer, she worked for wealthy clients and corporations, and as a judge she tried both criminal and civil cases. Benchmark Cases         From 1955 to 1966, she served Pennsylvania as Deputy Attorney General and played a key role in two benchmark cases. One of them ended the whites-only policy that the founder of Girard College had written into his will. The other opened the celebrated art collection of the tax-exempt Barnes Foundation to the public.         She became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia in 1971 and retired as a senior judge in 1987.         Lois Goldstein Forer was born in Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University in 1935. She worked briefly as a reporter and then as a union organizer. Dissatisfied, she returned to Northwestern for a law degree and spent several years in public service in Washington before moving to Philadelphia as a law clerk in Federal Court.         After her stint as Deputy Attorney General in 1966, she organized the Office for Juveniles at Community Legal Services and headed it for nearly two years.         Judge Forer received national attention with her first book, "No One Will Lissen: How Our Legal System Brutalizes the Youthful Poor" (1970). In it, she argued that the humane ideal to treat juveniles differently had been mangled in practice. For the most part, she wrote, juveniles falling into the system are poor, nonwhite and defenseless.         Her "Criminals and Victims: A Trial Judge Reflects on Crime and Punishment" (1980) tried to make sense of seeking to mete out justice in an environment of abstract theories of the way things are supposed to be. A judge, she asserted, finds little in the way of either practical guidance or spiritual comfort from abstractions.) Critical Views on Justice         "Money and Justice: Who Owns the Courts?" (1984) describes a system that costs too much and takes too long and often results in "substantial injustice." "A Chilling Effect: The Mounting Threat of Libel and Invasion of Privacy Actions to the First Amendment" (1987) argued for definitions of what is libelous and what is newsworthy. Federal legislation to that end would help rid the First Amendment of the ballast a litigious society has heaped on it, she contended.         Since her fourth-stage lymphoma was diagnosed eight months ago, Judge Forer finished two more books. One, "What Every Woman Should Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money," is scheduled for publication by MacMillan later this year.         Her highly topical last book, "The Rage to Punish: The Unintended Consequences of Mandatory Sentencing," is on W. W. Norton's list for next month.         Judge Forer is survived by her husband, Morris L. Forer; two sons, Stuart, of Warwick, R.I., and John, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Hope Forer Ross of Manhattan; a sister, Marion Schott of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and two grandsons.         Correction:  May 14, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Wednesday about Lois G. Forer, author and retired Philadelphia judge, referred incorrectly to the publication of her book "What Every Woman Needs to Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money." The publication, by Macmillan, is not due later this year; it occurred in February.       
         Elizabeth Birdsall Burdick, the founding director of the International Theater Institute Library in New York, died last Friday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         She had a heart attack in her home, her family said.         A native of Haddonville, N.J., Mrs. Burdick graduated from Wellesley College and the Yale Drama School. She began her career as a production secretary on Broadway.         In 1969, she founded and organized the library for the institute and served as its archivist and curator until her retirement in 1988. The library holds resource materials from 146 countries and about 13,000 foreign play scripts.         Mrs. Burdick is survived by her husband, John; two sons, Owen of Jersey City and Richard of Manhattan; her brother, Robert Birdsall of Haddonfield, and two grandchildren.       
         Rita Webb Smith, a community advocate whose work to rid a neighborhood of drug trafficking gained her national attention, died last Saturday at her home in Harlem. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A lifelong resident of West 143d Street, Mrs. Smith was a social worker and counselor for many years at Harlem Hospital, the Children's Aid Society and, most recently, the Visiting Nurse Service.         Starting with the organization of a preservation group for her street, she helped the police in her precinct to clear a drug-infested neighborhood. Her preservation group was largely credited with the restoration of a 10-block area in Harlem between 138th and 144th Streets.         Her efforts received the attention of national television shows and she recounted her experiences in a book written with Tony Chapelle, "The Woman Who Took Back Her Street" (New Horizon, 1990). It describes her life and her efforts to keep drug dealers and addicts from dominating her surroundings. Making a Difference         Mrs. Smith founded her own agency, the Family Systems for Living Center, to provide individual counseling, classes, referrals and other social services. She also started M.A.N.A. -- Make A Neighborhood Again -- to keep up the restored area; and Project Living With AIDS, which provides counseling for AIDS patients.         Mrs. Smith graduated from Fordham University College at Lincoln Center and Fordham's Graduate School of Social Service. The university made her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1984 for showing that "even one citizen can make a difference." Her work also drew praise from Mayor Koch and President Reagan.         She is survived by seven daughters and sons: Judy, David, Gladys, Peter, Abena and Ayana, all of Harlem, and Mark, a resident of Spring Valley, N.Y. Also surviving is a sister, Pearl Edwards, of St. John's, Antigua.       
         Dr. Janet G. Woititz, a best-selling author, lecturer and counselor to the troubled offspring of alcoholics, died last Thursday at her home in Roseland, N.J. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Woititz's "Adult Children of Alcoholics" offered insights into typical patterns in the families of alcoholics, like lack of self-esteem and difficulty relating to people.         The trade paperback turned into something of a publishing phenomenon. Issued by Health Communications Inc. in 1983, the book won a grass-roots following and made best-seller lists around the country in 1986 and stayed on them for about a year.         An expanded edition appeared in 1990. The book was translated into six foreign languages; the English version alone has sold 1.8 million copies.         Another of her books, "Struggle for Intimacy" (1985), also reached best-seller lists, and has sold 900,000 copies. Doctorate from Rutgers         Dr. Woititz was born in Great Neck, L.I., and graduated from Antioch College. She received an M.A. from Montclair State College, where she became an adjunct professor. Her doctorate in education was granted by Rutgers University in 1976. She taught during the summer at the Rutgers Center for Alcoholic Studies.         She was the founder and president of the Institute for Counseling and Training of West Caldwell, N.J. The institute provides therapeutic counseling for people with family problems, overeating habits and other disorders.         Dr. Woititz's other books include "Healthy Parenting: An Empowering Guide for Adult Children" (1992), "Lifeskills for Adult Children Workbook" (1991), "Healing Your Sexual Self" (1989), "The Self-Sabotage Syndrome: Adult Children in the Workplace" (1989), "Home Away From Home" (1987) and "Marriage on the Rocks" (1986), all in print. She also contributed to academic journals and lectured in this country and abroad.         Dr. Woititz is survived by two sons, David, of West Orange, N.J., and Daniel, of Roseland; a daughter, Lisa Taub of Allentown, N.J.; two grandchildren, and her companion, Bernard Zweben.       
         Elizabeth Nitze Paepcke, who played a central role in transforming Aspen, Colo., from a largely abandoned 19th-century mining town into a winter resort, died on Wednesday at her home in Aspen. She was 91.         She died of complications from a head injury she suffered in a fall last weekend, her family said.         Mrs. Paepcke (pronounced PEP-keh) collaborated with -- and often inspired -- her husband, Walter, a Chicago industrialist, in the development of what was nearly a ghost town by the 1940's. Mr. Paepcke bought about half the town, then proceeded to rebuild it.         The Paepckes helped open the International Design Conference in Aspen, the Aspen Music Festival and the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. Mrs. Paepcke also founded the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies. Goethe Festival in 1949         Modern Aspen was put on the cultural map in 1949 when Mr. Paepcke engaged the Budapest String Quartet for a concert to celebrate his wife's birthday. This led to the Goethe Bicentennial Festival, also in 1949, with Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician and medical missionary in Africa, making his only visit to the United States to address the festival at Mrs. Paepcke's suggestion.         "In most ways Aspen is Elizabeth Paepcke," said David McLaughlin, president of the Aspen Institute, which holds seminars for leaders from various fields in the United States and overseas. "She and Walter created the institutions that gave vision and vitality to the community."         Mrs. Paepcke was born in Baltimore and as a young woman worked as an interior designer in Chicago. She first saw Aspen while on a skiing vacation in 1938, when it had no amenities like ski runs or lifts.         Once a rich silver-mining town with a population of 15,000, Aspen was largely dilapidated in the 1930's, but its natural setting and faded charm caused her to return in 1946 with her husband.         Aspen, in west-central Colorado just west of the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains, now has a year-round population of about 5,000. In recent years, Mrs. Paepcke expressed some disenchantment with the direction Aspen's "renaissance" had taken, with its emphasis on wealth and celebrity and its proliferation of boutiques and ski resorts.         Mr. Paepcke, who headed the Container Corporation of America, died in 1960 at the age of 63.         Mrs. Paepcke is survived by three daughters, Anina Hamilton of Sussex, England, Paula Zurcher of Woodside, Calif., and Antonia DuBrul of Manhattan; a brother, Paul H. Nitze of Washington, the longtime United States arms negotiator who is now retired; eight grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Frances Corey, a fashion executive whose career of six decades began before the era of the flappers and took in space-age fabrics developed for astronauts, died on Thursday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, said Keven Bellows of Los Angeles, a family friend.         Ms. Corey's working life began at the age of 19 when she opened a bookstore in the Annex of the Marshall Field department store in Chicago. She subsequently became director of fashion and advertising for Bloomingdale's in New York.         Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, she was named sales-promotion and advertising manager of the May Company. She returned to New York in 1953 to join R. H. Macy & Company as an executive vice president -- the first woman to rise to that executive level at Macy's.         Ms. Corey moved back to California in 1960 to head the West Coast office of Grey Advertising. Over the years, she also served as senior vice president of Catalina, a sportswear company based in Los Angeles, and as a merchandising and marketing consultant for Bullock's department stores.         The space age entered her career when she was engaged as a consultant by a center at the University of Southern California that evaluated products developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. She advised the center about the commercial potential of the products and, with her husband, George Corey, founded Environmental Concepts Products to market them.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was associated with the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, lecturing and meeting weekly with students for career counseling. At a luncheon held in 1982 in a hall named after her, the institute honored her for her contributions.         In 1956, Fortune magazine ranked her among the top businesswomen in the United States, and she won the National Retail Merchants Gold Medal for retailing twice.         Ms. Corey is survived by a daughter, Mary Corey, and a granddaughter, both of Beverly Hills. Her husband died last year.       
         K. T. Stevens, a theater, film and television actress and a theatrical-union official, died on June 13 at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was lung cancer, said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.         Ms. Stevens, whose original name was Gloria Wood, was born in Hollywood. Her father was the film director Sam Wood. She began acting in plays and films as a child, using the stage name Katherine Stevens. After starring in the radio soap opera "Mr. Pepper's Family" and taking ingenue roles on the stage, she made her Broadway debut in "The Land Is Bright" in 1941. She also appeared on Broadway in "Nine Girls" (1943) and "Laura" (1947).         In the 1940's and 50's Ms. Stevens played leading roles in such films as "Address Unknown" (1944), "Port of New York," (1949), "Harriet Craig" (1950) and "Vice Squad" (1953). More recently, she appeared in "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" (1969) and "Pets" (1974).         Her television credits include appearances on "I Love Lucy," "The Rifleman," "The Patty Duke Show" "Mannix," "Days of Our Lives" and "General Hospital." For more than five years she played Vanessa on "The Young and the Restless."         Ms. Stevens served on local and national boards of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists from 1978 until her death. She was president of the union's Los Angeles local from 1986 to 1989.         Her marriage to the film actor Hugh Marlowe ended in divorce in 1967.

         Marie Janis Emery, who directed school programs countrywide for exceptional and gifted American Indian children before she retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs last month, died on Tuesday at her home in Centreville, Va. She was 64.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Emery, an Oglala Sioux, spent 37 years in public service. She joined the bureau, a division of the Interior Department, in 1979 and most recently headed the branch that allocates money for exceptional pupils attending Indian schools.         She was born on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the Badlands of South Dakota and received her undergraduate education at Bacone College in Muskogee, Okla. She studied education at Black Hills State College in Spearfish, S.D., graduating with honors, and took graduate courses at universities in the Midwest.         In 1950, Mrs. Emery became the first member of the Oglala Sioux tribe to teach elementary school among the Oglalas. She taught at Indian schools in South Dakota and Montana until 1970, when she was recruited as an administrator of educational programs for what was then the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The programs she oversaw broke new ground in bilingual classroom instruction.         Transferred to Washington as an education specialist in 1974, she administered bilingual and other programs designed for Indian children. This led to her move to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1979. At the time of her retirement last month she was the acting chief of the Branch of Exceptional Education, an office set up to benefit both disabled and especially talented children.         Mrs. Emery is survived by her husband of 40 years, Charles E.; three daughters, Roxane G. Holmes and Jamie N. Emery, both of Centreville, and Robin E. Loring of Virginia Beach, Va.; three sons, Charles R., of Fayetteville, N.C., Randy B., of Centreville, and Ronald H., of Stafford, Va.; a brother, Sylvestor Janis of Kyle, S.D., and eight grandchildren.       
         Phyllis J. Shorenstein, a founder of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, died on Wednesday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Shorenstein had a heart ailment and died after a long illness, doctors said.         The wife of Walter Shorenstein, a national real estate developer, Mrs. Shorenstein was also a substantial contributor to local charities and universities.         Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco, in a tribute, said that Mrs. Shorenstein and her husband had contributed much to the city's cultural, social and civic life and had "consistently helped make this city a better place for all of us."         Art, particularly Asian art, was an enduring interest in Mrs. Shorenstein's life. She joined with other San Franciscans to create the Asian Art Museum, which opened in Golden Gate Park in 1966. She served as a board member for many years and was one of the museum's 27 commissioners at her death. Gallery Named for Family         She last visited the museum in May, when it opened an exhibition and named one of its four galleries of Japanese art in honor of the Shorenstein family. Although she was particularly devoted to Japanese and Chinese art, her tastes also extended to Western works. Her personal collection included both European and American art.         Mrs. Shorenstein made frequent visits abroad in search of additions to the museum's collection, accompanied by Rand Castile, the museum's director. "She began at the Asian Art Museum at its beginning, and she was with us every step of the way," Mr. Castile said yesterday. In the last 20 years, the Shorenstein family has donated works from China, Japan, India, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey.         With her family, Mrs. Shorenstein established the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. The center was named in honor of her daughter, a journalist and radio news producer who died of cancer in 1986.         Mrs. Shorenstein was born Phyllis Finley in Wellington, Kan., and attended Lone Mountain College in San Francisco.         She was a volunteer ambulance driver at Travis Air Force Base when she met Walter Shorenstein, who was stationed there during World War II.         Mr. Shorenstein became a leading commercial real estate developer and a prominent contributor to Democratic Party causes. She was not active in politics, but the Shorensteins frequently entertained political dignitaries, including Presidents Johnson, Carter and Clinton.         She is survived by her husband of 49 years; two children, Carole Shorenstein-Hays and Douglas Shorenstein, both of San Francisco, and six grandchildren.       
         Miriam Louise Barber Judd, a former trustee of Mount Holyoke College and a member of the Y.W.C.A. board, died on Thursday at the Collington Life Care Community in Mitchellville, Md. She was 89.         The cause was sepsis, a type of blood poisoning, her family said.         She was born in India and was the daughter of missionaries. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke in South Hadley, Mass., she taught school in India, then returned to the United States and received a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College.         In 1932 she married Dr. Walter H. Judd and moved with him to China, where he was a Congregational medical missionary. She taught high school there until the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 drove the family from China.         In 1942 Dr. Judd, a Republican, was elected to Congress from Minnesota and rose to prominence as a crusader against Japanese military expansionism and Chinese Communism; he retired from Congress in the 1960's.         During her time in Washington, Mrs. Judd, as a board member of the Young Women's Christian Association, championed the regional merger of racially segregated branches into the National Capital Area Y.W.C.A., whose 50,000 members made it the nation's largest at the time.         She also worked extensively for Mount Holyoke, and was awarded the Alumnae Medal of Honor in 1975.         Dr. Judd died in February at the age of 95. She is survived by three daughters, Mary Louise Carpenter of Minneapolis, Carolyn Judd of Los Angeles and Eleanor Quinn of Hartford, seven grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.         One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.         Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979). Role in War on Poverty         She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.         A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.         Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.         She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .       
         Dr. Florence Shishko Schwartz, a retired professor of social work at the Hunter College School of Social Work, died on Wednesday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. She was 73 and had homes in Greenport, N.Y., and Greenwich.         The cause was complications from cardiac arrest two weeks after heart surgery, said her daughter, Deborah Schwartz Rapaport.         Dr. Schwartz was on her school's faculty for 33 years, rising from instructor to full professor and retiring in 1991.         She was instrumental in having the subject of voluntarism added to the school's curriculum and was an editor of The Journal of Volunteer Administration.

         Josephine Moy Hong, active in Chinese-American affairs and Republican Party politics, died on Sunday in Flushing Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Jamaica Estates, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Hong was born in Boston but spent much of her childhood in southern China, where her father moved when she was 8 years old to help develop the mining industry.         She returned to the United States in 1917 and studied economics and psychology at the University of Chicago and New York University. In 1923 she married Louis Fong Sui Hong, who was instrumental in expanding operations in Asia for the National City Bank of New York. The family went to live at Shanghai's International Settlement, an enclave of foreigners guarded by Western forces, when the Japan invaded China in 1937. Mrs. Hong tended to the wounded and sick while under bombardments.         Back in the United States in 1939, she organized a group of Chinese volunteers to raise funds for war refugees in New York. After Pearl Harbor, she served as a director of the National Board of the American Women's Voluntary Service and as chairman of its Chinese unit in New York.         In the decades since, she held leading positions in the Chinese Women's Benevolent Association, the Institute of Chinese Culture, the Chinese Cultural Renaissance Society and the Asian American Assembly, among others.         She turned to Republican Party politics in the 1960's and was vice president of the New York State Republican Heritage Groups Council.         She was inducted as a Life Member of the Republican Party in 1979. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan named her to his Peace Corps Advisory Council.         Mrs. Hong is survived by three sons; Alfred of Jamaica Estates, Robert of Syosset, L.I., and Morris of Fresh Meadows, Queens; a daughter, Virginia Wei of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Moy of Chicago; a sister, Mae Wu of Berkeley, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Jane Elizabeth Richmond, a writer with a special interest in films and television, died on Monday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 57 and had homes in Pawcatuck, Conn., and Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Richmond, a native of Westerly, R.I., was a graduate of Barnard College and worked in advertising before turning to editing and writing. As an editor for Partisan Review, she was associated with the Beat writers. She also served as a literary assistant to Mary McCarthy.

She also wrote for television and adapted several short plays from the repertory of the Grand Guignol Theater of Paris for presentation in the United States.         Ms. Richmond is survived by her father, Richard, and a brother, Barry, both of Stonington, Conn.       
         Jeannette Walters, a soprano, teacher and vocal coach, died on June 1 at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens. She was 52.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         An exponent of contemporary music, Miss Walters appeared regularly with the Theater Chamber Players in Washington and the Continuum ensemble in New York City. She also performed at the Colorado Springs Opera, with Sarah Caldwell's company in Boston, and with the Mostly Mozart Festival.

         The Rev. Beatrice Blair, associate priest at St. George's Episcopal Church on East 16th Street, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in the East Village.         The cause was a heart attack, her husband, John Robbins, said.         Her ordination in 1978 put her among the first female priests in the Episcopal Church. She had served at St. George's for the last four years, after assignments at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. Scion of Blair House Family         A native of Boston, Ms. Blair was raised in Washington, a scion of the family that gave Blair House to the United States Government, which turned it into a residence for dignitaries visiting Washington as guests of the White House. She attended Bryn Mawr College but graduated from the Manhattan branch of Empire State College, and trained for the priesthood at the General Theological Seminary, in Manhattan.         Before moving to New York from Rochester, she was a president of the Monroe County League of Planned Parenthood and the founding president of Eleanor's List, a group formed to raise funds for female candidates who support abortion rights. In the early 1970's, she was also executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.         More recently, she was a leader in the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights.         Besides her husband, Ms. Blair is survived by a daughter and three sons from a previous marriage: Elizabeth Hillard of Pleasant Hill, Calif., Harper Sibley Jr. of Portland, Me., Blair Sibley of Miami, and Durbin Sibley of Corpus Christi, Tex.; three sisters, Judy Green of Cincinnati, Betsy Douglas of Missoula, Mont., and Edith Blair of Alexandria, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Irma Shorell, a skin-care specialist and retired cosmetics executive, died on Monday in her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Shorell got her start in the industry by working for Estee Lauder when Ms. Lauder was still a small entrepreneur. She also modeled and acted.         When Ms. Shorell entered her 30's and began to notice signs of aging in her own complexion, her father, Dr. I. David Shorell, who was a well-known surgeon, prescribed a special postoperative skin formula of his own invention.         In 1961 Ms. Shorell formed a business with a $1,500 investment and Dr. Shorell's cream -- marketed under the name Contour/35 -- as its first product. The company, Irma Shorell Inc., eventually added a cleanser, sun blocks and other skin-care items in a full line of products for women and men. She sold the company in 1985 to Alfin Fragrances Inc. of New York.         A column bearing Ms. Shorell's byline was published weekly as an advertisement in Women's Wear Daily until the 1980's.       
         Alexandra Troubetzkoy Malcom, a Russian princess and an artist who exhibited in this country and in Europe, died on Friday at Cabrini Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         She had been in declining health for some time, said her daughter, Alexandra Rose.         Ms. Troubetzkoy, who used her maiden name professionally, was born in St. Petersburg into the grand nobility of Czarist Russia. A princess herself, she was a grandniece of Prince Paul Troubetzkoy, the sculptor. The family left Russia in 1919, after the October Revolution, and she was educated in France and England.         During the 1930's and 1940's she lived in Italy with her husband, Vittorio Pietrasanta. After his death, she followed her parents to the United States.         She started studying drawing and watercolors at the age of 10. In New York, she trained at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design. She also attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and studied fine arts at Oxford University.         She had her first exhibition in 1955 in New York. Her watercolor landscapes became part of the collections of museums and private buyers.         Her second husband, Donald C. Malcom, died in 1971.         Besides her daughter, a resident of Manhattan, Ms. Troubetzkoy is survived by two sisters, Mary Shurtleff of Nyack, N.Y., and Countess Brun de St. Hippolyte of Paris, and two granddaughters.       
         Ann McGarry Buchwald, wife of the columnist Art Buchwald and an author and former literary agent, died on Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 74.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         In the 1970's Mrs. Buchwald was a Washington partner of Irving Lazar, one of Hollywood's top literary and talent agents. But in 1974, after Mr. Lazar agreed to try to sell the memoirs of former President Richard M. Nixon, Mrs. Buchwald ended her partnership, citing a conflict of principle because her husband had written many satirical columns about Watergate and Mr. Nixon.         Besides her autobiography, "Seems Like Yesterday," Mrs. Buchwald was the co-author of "White Gloves and Party Manners" (Robert B. Luce, 1965) and "Stand Up, Shake Hands, Say 'How Do You Do' " (Robert B. Luce, 1969).         Mrs. Buchwald, who was born in Warren, Pa., was also a fashion coordinator for Neiman-Marcus in Dallas, and later was a publicity director for Pierre Balmain in Paris. In 1950, while still in Paris, she opened a public relations firm. She met Mr. Buchwald there the same year, and they married in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Connie Marks of Culpeper, Va., and Jennifer Buchwald of Boston; a son, Joel, of Denver; three grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers.       
         Frances Riker Duncombe, a writer long active in Westchester community affairs, died on June 27 at Brandywine Nursing Home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. A resident of Cross River, N.Y., she was 93.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Born in Bernardsville, N.J., Mrs. Duncombe was educated at Miss Porter's School, Bryn Mawr College and the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts.         Between 1939 and 1967, she published seven children's books, including "Hoo DeWitt" (1941), "High Hurdles" (1941), "Eeemi, the Story of a Clown" (1946) and "The Quetzal Feather" (1968).         In later years, she was the author of "Summer of the Burning" (1976) and contributed to "Katonah: A History of a New York Village and Its People," published by the Katonah Improvement Society in 1961.         In 1975, she donated 48 acres to the Mount Holly Nature Preserve. She was active in the Katonah Women's Civic Club, the Bedford Historical Society and the League of Women's Voters of Bedford-Lewisboro.         Her husband, Herbert S. Jr., a lawyer, died in 1982 after 57 years of marriage.         Mrs. Dunscombe is survived by two sons, Herbert S. 3d, of Veneta, Ore., and David C., of White Salmon, Wash.; a daughter, Cynthia D. Bell of Oroville, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Anna Meyer, who took part in civic affairs and charitable causes for many years, died on Sunday in North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 74 and a Glen Cove resident.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Meyer, a native of Providence, R.I., was a trustee emeritus of Connecticut College in New London, her alma mater. She served Govs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Malcolm Wilson as a member of the New York State Board of Social Welfare.

         Dorothy Hodgkin, a British scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1964, died on Friday in her home at Shipston-on-Stour, in Warwickshire in central England. She was 84.         She died after suffering a stroke, her family said.         Professor Hodgkin was the chancellor of Bristol University from 1970 until her retirement in 1988, and also taught at Oxford.         She was the third woman to win the Nobel chemistry award. The first two were Marie Curie, in 1911, and her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie, in 1935.         Professor Hodgkin had used X-rays to probe into the inner architecture of key biochemical compounds, elucidating their structures and providing essential aid for those seeking to understand how and why these compounds work in living organisms.         Over the years, she was the author of a variety of scientific writings on the X-ray crystallographic analysis of structures of molecules, including penicillin, vitamin B12 and insulin.         The Times of London, in looking back over her career, observed on Saturday, "She will always be remembered for her discovery of the structure of penicillin, of the antipernicious anemia factor vitamin B12 and of the diabetic hormone, insulin."         The Swedish Academy of Science, in announcing Professor Hodgkin's prize, praised her "exceptional skill, in which chemical knowledge, intuition, imagination and perseverance have been conspicuous."         In 1965, Queen Elizabeth II made Professor Hodgkin the first woman since Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), the founder of modern nursing, to become a member of the Order of Merit, Britain's most respected royal order. It is limited at any time to 24 members, who have excelled in science, art, letters or the armed services. Years before, in 1947, Professor Hodgkin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for her analysis of penicillin.         In 1960 she became Royal Society Wolfson Research Professor at Oxford, and she retired from that chair in 1977. She held other titles at Oxford in earlier decades, and was a fellow of that university's Somerville College from 1936 to 1977. Among her undergraduate students at Oxford was Margaret Thatcher, who went into politics, not chemistry, to become a long-serving Prime Minister.         In addition, Professor Hodgkin was a member or fellow of numerous learned bodies in Britain, the United States and other countries. And she was a founding member of Pugwash, the international organization of scientists who tried to improve communication between scientists on the Iron Curtain's two sides during the cold war. Pugwash was established in 1957, in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, to study problems linked to the development of weapons of mass destruction.         Professor Hodgkin was born Dorothy Mary Crowfoot in Cairo, where her father worked for the Egyptian Government. She went on to a school in England -- the Sir John Leman School in Beccles, in Suffolk -- and to study chemistry at Oxford and then at Cambridge, in an era when few British women pursued university-level studies in science.         She married Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, an eminent Africanist and Arabist, in 1937; he died in 1982.         Her survivors include two sons and a daughter.       
         Mary C. McDonald, a retired assistant director of continuing education for the New York City schools, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Centre, L.I. She was 83.         The cause was chronic kidney failure, her family said.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. McDonald graduated from Hunter College and Columbia University Teachers College. She took a job as a substitute teacher during the Depression, then in the mid-1930's became the Department of Parks director of recreation for Queens.         She returned to the Board of Education in 1948 and specialized in adult literacy and English as a second language. She was also a consultant to the State Division of Higher Education, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Governments of Egypt and Greece. She retired from the school system in 1971.         Mrs. McDonald is survived by a son, Dr. Brian F. of Rockville Centre; a sister, Anna Gordon of Bayside, Queens, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 34 years, F. Joseph McDonald, died in 1983.       
         Alice Childress, an actress and a writer of plays and novels, including "A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich," died on Sunday at Astoria General Hospital in Queens. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Nathan Woodard.         In 1973, in a review of "A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich" in The New York Times, the playwright Ed Bullins wrote: "There are too few books that convince us that reading is one of the supreme gifts of being human. Alice Childress, in her short, brilliant study of a 13-year-old black heroin user, achieves this feat in a masterly way."         In the mid-1970's, the book was at the center of a controversy when a Long Island school district banned it and works by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Langston Hughes and others on the grounds that they contained obscenities and other material considered offensive. Ms. Childress adapted her novel for a 1978 film that starred Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield.         Among her other books were "Rainbow Jordan," "Those Other People," "When the Rattlesnake Sounds," "Let's Hear It for the Queen," "Like One of the Family" and "A Short Walk." 'Wedding Band'         One of her plays was "Wedding Band," an interracial love story set in Charleston, S.C., at the time of World War I. Ms. Childress wrote the play in 1965 but was unable to find a New York producer until the New York Shakespeare Festival presented it in 1972. In a review of a 1979 production of the play, Richard Eder wrote in The Times that the ideas in "Wedding Band" were "like wildflowers growing in their own ground; not, as in works of less art, like cut flowers sorted and offered by the dozen at a florist shop." ABC later produced the play for television, but eight of the network's affiliates declined to carry the show because of its theme and earthy dialogue.         Her other plays included "Florence," "Gold Through the Trees," "Just a Little Simple," "Trouble in Mind," "String" and "Mojo." With Mr. Woodard, she wrote musicals including "Young Martin Luther King," "Sea Island Song," "Gullah" and "Moms (A Praise Play for a Black Comedienne)," about Jackie (Moms) Mabley.         Ms. Childress was born in Charleston on Oct. 12, 1916. Before she turned to writing, she was an actress with the American Negro Theater, and acted in the original company of "Anna Lucasta." At the time of her death, she was working on a novel for young adults about her African great-grandmother, a slave until the age of 12, and her Scotch-Irish great-grandmother.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a granddaughter, Marilyn Alice Lee of Brooklyn.       
         Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on Sunday at her summer home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 78.         Dr. Coser, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of kidney failure, her family said.         She taught at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987, after which she moved to Cambridge. At her death she was an adjunct professor of sociology at Boston College, specializing in the family and medical sociology.         She was born in Berlin and reared in Belgium; she came to the United States in 1939. She started studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research but switched to sociology at Columbia University, where she earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert K. Merton. Taught Sociology at Harvard         Dr. Coser began her teaching career as an instructor at Wellesley College. In 1959 she began teaching at the Harvard University Medical School as an assistant professor of sociology in the department of psychiatry, and later became an associate professor. She also taught at Northeastern University in Boston.         She was the author of "Life in the Ward" (1962) and was involved as a contributor to or editor of "Sociological Studies of Health and Sickness" (1960), "Studies in the Hospital" (1963) and "The Family, Its Structure and Functions" (revised in 1974).         Her recent writing includes "Training in Ambiguity: Learning Through Doing in a Mental Hospital" (1979), "In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy" (1991) and "Laughter Among Colleagues" (1993). All three books remain in print.         Dr. Coser is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Lewis A. Coser, also a sociologist; a daughter, Dr. Ellen C. Perrin of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Steven M. of Melrose, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Donna Kay Price, a Westchester County real estate executive and former director of the Lighthouse for the Blind of New York and Westchester, died on Saturday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Waccabuc, N.Y.         Mrs. Price died of head injuries suffered in a fall at her home, her family said.         Mrs. Price, who was blind, was a longtime fund-raiser for the Seeing Eye Inc. in Morristown, N.J., which trains guide dogs for the blind. She was a past member of the board of the Lighthouse Inc. of New York and its Westchester division.         "She was a devoted supporter of services to people with visual impairments in the Hudson Valley," said Judith Millman, the organization's regional director in White Plains. Started in Advertising         Born in Terre Haute, Ind., Mrs. Price was a Phi Beta Kappa history graduate of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. She worked briefly in advertising before making her career in real estate. She was associated for 33 years with Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate of Bronxville, N.Y., most recently as a vice president and manager of the Katonah, N.Y., and Bedford, N.Y., offices.         In an interview three years ago, Mrs. Price said she was a diabetic and lost her sight completely over a period of two years, beginning about 1973.         "In the 1970's, they didn't know what to do with diabetes and eyesight problems," she said. "Now they have a pretty good chance of saving the eyesight with lasers."         She said she turned to the Lighthouse when her sight began to fail and remained associated with them ever since.         Mrs. Price is survived by her husband, Kenneth W., of Waccabuc; a daughter, Darcy Lee Price of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Timothy of Port Jervis, N.Y.; and a sister, Barbara Lee Crowder of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Edwina d'Erlanger, the widow of Baron Leo d'Erlanger, died Aug. 18 in a hospital in Geneva, where she had lived since 1975. She was 87.         The cause of death was a stroke, according to her sister, Mary Whelan Prue Warburg.         Mrs. d'Erlanger, who modeled and was a professional dancer in Europe in her youth, became a well-known hostess in London during her marriage to the baron, whose title was German but whose family had lived in England since the 19th century.         The former Edwina Prue was born in New York City but spent most of her childhood on a ranch in New Mexico. At 17, she returned to New York with her family and worked for Clare Boothe Luce as a junior editor at Vanity Fair magazine.         Later, she was chosen to model for the haute-couture house of Jean Patou in Paris. She stayed on in Europe to perform as a ballroom dancer under the name Edwina Saint Clair.         On her return to New York, she was the understudy for June Walker in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," leaving to be married to Baron d'Erlanger in 1929. The couple divided their time between London and Tunis.         She was married for more than 50 years to the Baron, who died 10 years ago.         She is survived by a son, Rodolphe, of London; a daughter, Tess d'Erlanger, of Oxford, England; three grandsons, and her sister, of Wilton, Conn..         She was buried in Geneva.       
         Nomi Mitty, an actress who appeared on stage and in films and television, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Mitty began her career as a child, appearing on Broadway with Shirley Booth in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" in 1951. She played Gertrude Berg's daughter on the popular radio show "The Goldbergs" and toured with Mercedes McCambridge in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and with Edward Everett Horton in "Harvey."         Her television credits included guest appearances on "Hill Street Blues," "Picket Fences," "Knot's Landing" and "L.A. Law." Among her films were "Serpico" and "Melvyn and Howard."         She is survived by her husband, Robert Kaylor; a son, Ross; two stepdaughters, Robin and Sarah, and three brothers and a sister.       
         Christine Lynn Potts, a Russian affairs expert on the staff of the National Security Council at the White House, died on Thursday at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 36.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Miss Potts, who was from Zanesville, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree in political science from Smith College and, in 1982, a master's degree in Russian studies from the University of Michigan. She began her career at the Brookings Institution as a research assistant on Soviet energy and economics.         She then spent two years at the Kennan Institute in Washington and went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1987. She joined the staff of the National Security Council in 1992, specializing in Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs. At the security council she was the principal policy assistant on the economies of the republics of the former Soviet Union.         Miss Potts also served as the executive secretary of a commission established by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia to foster economic and technological cooperation between the two nations. In that capacity, she helped to arrange the panel's first meeting last September.         She is survived by her parents, Robert and Jean Potts of Callawassie Island, S.C.; and two brothers, Mark, of Bozeman, Mont., and Jeff, of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Valerie Worth Bahlke, a poet and novelist for young readers, died on Sunday at her home in Clinton, N.Y. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bahlke, who wrote under her maiden name, Valerie Worth, had many interests, from astronomy to gardening to meditation, which became the subject matter she wove into her poetry. She sought to present ordinary things in a fresh way.         She was most widely known for her "small poems" for children, composed in simple free verse. The poet and teacher Myra Cohn Livingston wrote of Ms. Worth's work in The New York Times Book Review in 1988, "The treasures Ms. Worth offers do not lie in some distant, golden land but in the everyday world." For example, of a safety pin, Ms. Worth wrote:         Closed, it sleeps         On its side         Quietly,         The silver         Image         Of some         Small fish;         Opened, it snaps         Its tail out         Like a thin         Shrimp, and looks         At the sharp         Point with a         Surprised eye.         In 1991, the National Council of Teachers of English honored her with its Poetry Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children, given for a body of work.         It was only one of many such citations she garnered over the years. Since the 1950's, her poems have been included in numerous anthologies. She also wrote fiction for adults and young people. 'Small Poems' by the Volume         She was born in Philadelphia and lived in Swarthmore, Pa., Tampa, Fla., and Bangalore, India, when her father, a biologist at Swarthmore College, was asked to go to India to study malaria. She graduated from Swarthmore in 1955.         After settling in Clinton, she joined an informal writing group at Kirkland College and met Natalie Babbitt, an author and illustrator who then furnished the black-and-white drawings for her work, starting with "Small Poems" in 1972. Three more volumes followed, in 1976, 1978 and 1985, and all four appeared in a single paperback in 1987.         Her other books included "The Crone's Book of Words" (1971) and "The Crone's Book of Wisdom" (1988); "Curlicues: The Fortunes of Two Pug Dogs" (1980), and two novels for young adults, "Gypsy Gold" (1983) and "Fox Hill" (1986).         Another book of her verses for children, "At Christmastime," was published two years ago. Much of her work remains in print, and at her death she had completed two more such collections of all-new poems. They are scheduled for publication by HarperCollins in 1995 and 1996.         She is survived by her husband, George W. Bahlke; a son, Conrad D., of Hoboken, N.J.; two daughters, Catherine B. Hornstein of Brooklyn and Margaret B. Diskin of West Chester, Pa.; two brothers, Michael Worth of Swarthmore and Douglas Worth of Newton, Mass., and a granddaughter.       
         Miriam K. Carliner, a Federal specialist on poverty and sexual bias in education, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 73.         The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.         A native of Bad Kreuznach, Germany, Mrs. Carliner migrated to the United States as a teen-ager and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1942 from George Washington University.         She dealt with problems of disadvantaged students in the District of Columbia school system and directed a study by the League of Women Voters that examined the allocation of resources among the schools of neighborhoods in the District in 1965.         In 1964 and 1965, she coordinated a conference for 27,000 people involved in Head Start, the early-education program for disadvantaged children.         As a senior program officer in the United States Office of Education, she oversaw demonstration projects aimed at the disadvantaged.         In 1980, Mrs. Carliner was appointed to direct the Woman's Action Program of the Department of Health and Human Services. She reported on sex discrimination in the department and assessed programs affecting women.         After she left the Government in 1985, she became a mediator for the District of Columbia's Superior Court and sat on the District's Civilian Complaint Review Board.         Mrs. Carliner is survived by her husband of 50 years, David; a son, Geoffrey, of West Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Deborah Carliner of Washington; a brother, Karl Kalter of Munich, and four grandchildren.       
         Jessie Sumner, an Illinois Republican who was the first woman elected to a county judgeship in her state and a conservative member of Congress from 1939 to 1947, died on Wednesday in Iroquois Memorial Hospital in Watseka, Ill. She was 96 and lived in nearby Milford.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Donna Rae Mann, Miss Sumner's assistant.         At her death, Miss Sumner was the president of Sumner National Bank, in Sheldon, Ill., which was founded by her father, Aaron Taylor Sumner. She took the post in 1966.         Miss Sumner was born on a farm in Iroquois County, Ill., grew up in that county and graduated from Smith College in 1920. She studied law at the University of Chicago and at Oxford and Columbia Universities. She worked as a lawyer in Chicago, New York and Milford.         In 1937, she became a judge in Iroquois County before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1938. She held the view, shared by many in her district in east-central Illinois, that the United States should not get involved in the war that was brewing in Europe.         After being elected to the House, she became nationally known as a foe of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and of his New Deal program and other policies. "What do I think of President Roosevelt?" she once asked, and then said she had come "to bury Caesar, not to praise him."         After World War II began in Europe in 1939, she found herself in a minority in Congress in voting against expanding the Navy. She was also among more than 100 representatives who voted, only months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, against extending the draft for a year.         After the United States entered the war in 1941, she criticized the country's allies, the conduct of the war, and Roosevelt Administration measures on the home front. She gained attention for her opposition to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which cared for refugees in Europe after the war, saying that if it was humanitarian, "so is keeping a gigolo."         Miss Sumner decided not to run for re-election in 1946. She then resumed practicing law in Milford and helped manage her family's insurance company, grain elevators and farms, in addition to the bank.         Survivors include a nephew, three nieces, six great-nephews and a great-niece.       
         Sheila Campbell Williamson, the founding director of the Community Foundation of New Jersey in Morristown, died on Sunday at her home in Short Hills, N.J. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Williamson, who continued to work until earlier this month, helped set up the foundation in 1980 and became a leader of the community-foundation movement in the United States. Such organizations collect endowed funds from individuals, businesses or private foundations to benefit innovative projects in a specific area.         Mrs. Williamson became the executive director of what began as the Essex County Community Foundation in 1980. Starting with little more than a borrowed desk and a phone, she nurtured the foundation into an organization with assets of about $11.5 million and distributions of more than $6 million.         Its donors include such corporate giants as Johnson & Johnson and the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Boys Chorus, the New Jersey Symphony, AIDS education, neighborhood initiatives, civic improvements and various social services have been among the beneficiaries. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is a trustee and former president but the foundation operates with little fanfare,         Mrs. Williamson was active in many local organizations, including the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, the Association for Children in New Jersey and the Orange Orphan Society. She was a member of the Planning Board of Millburn and Short Hills.         Mrs. Williamson was a native of Glasgow. She graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., and received a master's degree in city and regional planning from Rutgers University. In the 1950's, she was a securities analyst for Bear, Stearns, one of the first women to be employed in that capacity on Wall Street.         Mrs. Williamson is survived by her husband, James G., and two daughters, Anne W. Holman of Short Hills and Christina Williamson of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Margaret Olds Strahl, a retired New York psychiatrist and analyst known for her research on the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, died on Monday at the William Hill Health Care Center in Easton, Md. She was 77.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Dr. Strahl was born in New York City, received her medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine in 1943 and completed her training in psychoanalysis at Columbia University in 1948. She was an associate in psychiatry at Columbia until 1966.         From 1968 to 1991, she worked at the New York Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center, while also keeping a private practice as a psychoanalyst, preparative psychotherapist and diagnostic consultant.         In the 1980's, she also worked for the Veterans Administration, specializing in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders among Vietnam veterans.         She was the author, co-author or editor of several volumes, including "Masked Schizophrenia: Diagnosis and a Unified Method of Treatment" (1980), "Differential Diagnosis in Clinical Psychiatry" (1972) and "The Complete Psychiatrist: The Achievements of Paul H. Hoch, M.D." (1968). An environmentalist, she donated a 400-acre family farm to the Chesapeake Audubon Society for an educational center in Easton.         Her husband, William E., died in 1974.         She is survived by two sons, Eric R., of Prescott, Ariz., and Dr. Stuart D., of Easton, and two granddaughters.       
         Barbara Fassbinder, one of the first health care professionals to be infected with the AIDS virus while on the job, died on Tuesday at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. She was 40 and lived in Monona, Iowa.         The cause was complications from AIDS, the hospital said.         Mrs. Fassbinder was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1986 while helping treat a patient in the emergency room of Memorial Hospital in Prairie du Chien, Wis.         While she was pressing gauze on a needle puncture, the patient's blood apparently mingled with her blood through small cuts on her hand from gardening, she said in 1990. The young man died, and an autopsy showed he had AIDS. But it was not until January 1987, when she tried to make a blood donation, that she discovered she had been infected.         She and her family kept the infection a secret until she decided to speak out in 1990. "My biggest fear was how the community would react to me and my kids and my husband," she said at a news conference in Iowa City in which she told her story in the hope that it would warn other health-care workers. The 1,500 people of Monona, a farming community in northeastern Iowa, gave her family "nothing but support," she said at the time.         Dr. Michael Osterholm, an AIDS expert and epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health who became a friend of her family, said she "helped bridge the gap between the worlds of the health care provider and the AIDS patient in need of competent and compassionate care like no one else could."         Mrs. Fassbinder traveled extensively, talking to people about AIDS and how to prevent infection by H.I.V., Dr. Osterholm said. She testified about AIDS before Congress, and in 1992 she was recognized by the Surgeon General and the Department of Health and Human Services for her work.         A native of Marion, Ohio, she also served on the National Health Care Reform Committee set up by Hillary Rodham Clinton and was a member of the Iowa State Commission on AIDS, Dr. Osterholm said.         She is survived by her husband, David; two daughters, Eva and Emily, and a son, Joel, all of Monona; her parents, James and Ethel Herring, of Marion, Iowa; three sisters, Kathryn Fassbinder, of Elgin, Iowa, Mary Walston of Kewaunee, Wis., and Susan Valleire of Rock Island, Ill.; four brothers, J. Stephen Herring of Idaho Falls, Idaho, Edward Herring, of Rockford, Ill., Mark Herring, of Manitowoc, Wis., and John Herring of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a grandmother, Martha McElroy of Creston, Iowa.       
         Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.         The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.         Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.         Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.         Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.       
         Barbara Drew Hoffstot, an architectural and community preservationist, died on Sept. 18 at her Pittsburgh home. She was 75 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla.; New Waterford, Ohio, and County Galway, Ireland.         She died after a long illness, The Palm Beach, Fla., Post reported.         At her death, Mrs. Hoffstot was a vice president of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach and vice chairwoman of the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, two groups that she helped found. She had served as co-chairwoman of Palm Beach's first Landmarks Preservation Commission and had drafted landmarks preservation legislation for that city. She was a former trustee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.         Her writings included the book "Landmark Architecture of Palm Beach," which was published in 1974 and has been twice revised.         Mrs. Hoffstot, whose family has spent winters in Palm Beach for three generations, was born Barbara S. Drew in Pittsburgh, graduated from the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., and attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, Henry Phipps Hoffstot Jr.; a daughter, Thayer of Westlake Village, Calif.; a son, Henry Phipps 3d of Ligonier, Pa., and New York, and four grandchildren.       
         Joy Ungerleider-Mayerson, a former director of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her son Andrew Ungerleider.         At her death, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was president of the Dorot Foundation, whose interests include biblical archeology and Jewish education. She was also the chairman of the Albright Institute for archeological research in Jerusalem and served on the boards of other cultural and educational institutions. She was the director of the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 92d Street, from 1972 to 1980, after being a curator there from 1967 to 1969.         In 1971, criticized for neglect of its Judaica collection and facing a substantial deficit, the museum's board decided that the institution should devote itself to "a commitment to the Jewish community." The museum was shut during that year, and Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson has been praised as having subsequently rescued it from its doldrums. She shifted the museum's focus from art to Jewish culture, instituting a strong education program and creating popular exhibitions on the subject of Israel and biblical archeology.         As a philanthropist, Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson was instrumental in providing support, through family foundations, for the New York Public Library. She was the author of one book, "Jewish Folk Art from the Biblical Period to Modern Times" (1986) and the co-author of another, "The Museums of Israel" (Abrams, 1989).         Mrs. Ungerleider-Mayerson, who was born in Lawrence, L.I., received a B.A. from New York University in 1942 and a master's degree in Hebrew Studies from New York University in 1971. She was married to Samuel Ungerleider in 1945; he died in 1972.         In addition to her sons Andrew, of Los Angeles, and Peter, of Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Dr. Steven Ungerleider of Eugene, Ore.; three daughters, Jeane Ungerleider-Springer of Boston, Miriam Mayerson-Michael of Manhattan and Clare Benac-Mayerson of Paris; two sisters, Celeste G. Bartos of Manhattan and Miriam G. Wallach of Scarsdale, N.Y., and seven grandchildren       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.  THEATER  Hamlet (1934)  King Lear (1940)  Portrait of a Madonna (1946)  A Streetcar Named Desire (1947)  The Fourposter (1951)  Five Finger Exercise (1959)  The Gin Game (1977)  The Glass Menagerie (1983)  The Petition (1986)  FILM  The Seventh Cross (1944)  Forever Amber (1947)  September Affair (1950)  The Desert Fox (1951)  The Light in the Forest (1958)  The Birds (1963)  Butley (1974)  Still of the Night (1982)  The World According to Garp (1982)  The Bostonians (1984)  Cocoon (1985)  Driving Miss Daisy (1989)  Fried Green Tomatoes (1991)  TELEVISION  Foxfire (1987)  The Story Lady (1991)  To Dance With the White Dog (1993)         Correction:  September 14, 1994, Wednesday         A picture caption on Monday with the obituary of Jessica Tandy referred incorrectly in some editions to her appearance in the film "Driving Miss Daisy." The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Ruth K. Friedlich, a writer whose articles were published in several magazines, including Reader's Digest and Better Homes and Gardens, and who helped write some of the earliest television commercials, died on Wednesday at the Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Conn.         Mrs. Friedlich, who was 97, lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was complications after a fall and surgery, her family said.         She is survived by a daughter, Kate Witkin, of Harrison, N.Y.; two sons, Dr. Allan Friedlich of Belmont, Mass., and Bruce Friedlich of New York, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Merrinelle Sullivan, a past president and longtime officer of the National Council of Women of the United States, died on Sunday in her Manhattan home. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said Robert Sonderskov, a family friend.         At her death, Mrs. Sullivan represented the International Council of Women, an umbrella organization for 78 national councils worldwide, to the United Nations Family Committee.         She had been executive director of the National Council in New York for 18 years before being elected president. As such, she oversaw its activities in New York and Washington in 1988, when both the national and international groups, which lobby for women's causes, observed their 100th anniversaries.         Although her cancer was diagnosed seven years ago, Mrs. Sullivan led an active life, working with women's groups and other organizations. She attended meetings in Indonesia, Cairo and Paris within the last year.         She also continued to work for the Manhattan League, Helen Keller Services for the Blind, Nightingale-Bamford School Volunteers and Mount Sinai Hospital.         Born Merrinelle Rice in Little Rock, Ark., she attended Stephens College in Missouri. Before her marriage in 1961, she managed a hotel in Cape May, N.J., and worked for a New York advertising agency.         She is survived by her husband, Robert A., and two daughters, Amanda, of Manhattan and Susan, a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.       
         Marcia Lawrence, who retired in January after 25 years as the director of communications for Planned Parenthood of New York City, died on Thursday at her home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         Beginning in 1968, Ms. Lawrence served as the chief writer for the organization, producing training manuals, public-service advertising and other written materials.         Her duties included informing the public about birth control and where to find services. In 1969, she wrote a comprehensive publication on family planning, "Yes, You Can," which the city bought in bulk for general distribution when New York State rewrote its abortion law the next year. It covered information on contraception, sterilization, adoption and abortion.         In 1971, Ms. Lawrence wrote a consumer guide, "Birth Control: All the Methods That Work and the Ones That Don't," which was sold to agencies nationwide. She edited a book-length guide to legal abortion services based on Planned Parenthood services in New York. It appeared in 1973, the year the Supreme Court legalized abortion.         Ms. Lawrence also created a campaign that persuaded the Yellow Pages to mention birth-control and abortion services in her agency's display ads. Starting in the mid-1970's, she composed the texts for full-page advocacy advertisements published in national newspapers. In 1984, she successfully campaigned for an increase in state appropriations for contraceptive services and consumer education on that subject.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Barnard College. She was a vestry member of the Episcopal Church of St. Luke-in-the-Fields in Greenwich Village. She was also a trustee of St. Luke's School.         Ms. Lawrence, who used her maiden name, is survived by a daughter, Alison Collins of Kew Gardens, Queens, and a son, Charles Collins of Forest Hills, Queens.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Gertrude Russek Nemerov, whose family founded and ran the Russeks Fifth Avenue department store in Manhattan and whose children won fame in the world of arts and letters, died on Tuesday in Albuquerque, N.M. She was 93.         Mrs. Nemerov's son, the poet Howard Nemerov, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1978 and served as Poet Laureate of the United States from 1988 to 1990. He died in 1991. One of her daughters was the photographer Diane Arbus, who died in 1971.         She is survived by another daughter, Renee Nemerov Sparkia of Albuquerque, six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Helene Thurman Martin Heinemann, a retired geriatric social worker, died on Thursday at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 88 and lived in New Canaan and Washington, Conn., before moving to Crosslands in 1977.         Her death followed a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Heinemann, a native of Harrisburg, Pa., graduated from Wellesley College and the New York School of Social Work.         She is survived by a son, H. Erich Heinemann of Great Neck, L.I., chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, investment bankers; a daughter, Marianne Russo of Oxford, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.; a brother, Frederick Martin of Orono, Me.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandson.         Her husband, Hans Heinemann, an investment banker, died in 1967.       
         Mildred Natwick, a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric, whimsical and spunky characters in plays, films and television for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Miss Natwick, a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner, was a familiar figure on the Broadway stage, where she appeared in some 40 productions. Among other roles, she played an idiosyncratic secretary in George Bernard Shaw's "Candida," an extroverted medium in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and a shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors."         The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson, in his review of the Anouilh play in 1957, characterized her performance as "protean" and one that "rides the whirlwind with a great sweep of venomous extravagance."         Miss Natwick's comic brilliance in Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park" prompted Walter Kerr to acclaim her in 1963 as "the most hilarious woman in the Western hemisphere." She further confirmed her versatility in 1970 in Harold Pinter's "Landscape" and in 1971 when, at the age of 62, she made her debut in a singing role in a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical, "70, Girls, 70," as the disarming leader of a circle of elderly people seeking self-esteem by stealing furs.         Among Miss Natwick's films were four directed by John Ford. She appeared as a prostitute in "The Long Voyage Home," a doomed mother in "The Three Godfathers," a hard-bitten Army wife in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and a sly widow in "The Quiet Man."         In a 1990 interview, she praised Ford as a masterly director who needed just a few words to inspire actors and give them the right clue or insight for a scene. In contrast, she said, Alfred Hitchcock, in directing the comedy "The Trouble With Harry," told her and the other actors precisely what he wanted.         Miss Natwick concentrated her career on Broadway, saying she had always preferred plays to movies because "on the stage, you're in control for two hours, while in a film, you do bits and pieces, usually out of sequence."         She received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work in the 1967 film version of "Barefoot in the Park." She also received several Tony and Emmy nominations and was awarded an Emmy for "The Snoop Sisters," a 1973-74 television series in which she and Helen Hayes played successful mystery writers who were obsessed with solving real crimes.         In an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, she said her main criterion for creating a role was to make a character as inseparable from herself as possible. Nearly everything, she remarked, "is hit or miss for a while, until it all comes together." She said her advice to young performers was: "Act every time you get a chance. At least in the beginning, go wherever acting is."         Miss Natwick, who was called Milly by friends and associates, was born in Baltimore on June 19, 1905, to Joseph Natwick, a businessman, and the former Mildred Marion Dawes. She graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and also from Bennett Junior College in Dutchess County, N.Y., where she majored in drama.         She began performing at the age of 21 with the Vagabonds, a nonprofessional group in Baltimore. She soon joined the celebrated University Players on Cape Cod, trading lines with such other young performers as Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Joshua Logan. She made her Broadway debut in the melodrama "Carry Nation" in 1932.         Among her films were "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945), "The Late George Apley" (1947), "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950), "The Court Jester" (1956), "If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium" (1967), "Daisy Miller" (1974) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988)         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  November 8, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary on Oct. 26 about the actress Mildred Natwick referred incorrectly to her debut in a singing role in a musical. It was in "Stars in Your Eyes" in 1939, not in "70, Girls, 70" in 1971.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Shirley Chernela, a former administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in Manhattan and the first woman to be president of the National Association of Temple Administrators, died Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Janet Chernela Mount, her daughter.         Ms. Chernela became the administrator of Temple Shaaray Tefila in 1972 and held the job for 20 years. She was president of the national administrators' group from 1982 to 1985. In 1991, she was elected an honorary trustee.         She was the first woman to be certified a Fellow in Temple Administration in a program set up by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the National Association of Temple Administrators.         In the early 1950's, her family joined with three others to found a congregation, Temple Emanuel in Great Neck, L.I., of which she served as administrator. She then became director of personnel and building services at the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, where she remained until joining Temple Shaaray Tefila.         In addition to Ms. Chernela Mount, she is survived by another daughter, Susan Chernilo, and a son, Abbey Chernela, both of New York; a sister, Diane Graf of Southbury, Conn., and a brother, Paul Moss of Hewlett, L.I.       
         Ruth Blumka, a prominent New York dealer in medieval and Renaissance art and a donor of artworks to museums around the country, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her son, Anthony Blumka.         Among the works donated to the Metropolitan Museum by Mrs. Blumka and her husband, Leopold, were a 15th-century silver tabernacle produced for the Monastery of St. Peter at Salzburg and a rare enameled devotional cradle made in the Netherlands in the 15th century.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Blumka donated other objects, including, in 1991, a German 15th-century tapestry from the altar of a Nuremberg church.         "It's a great loss," Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said yesterday. "Ruth Blumka was really an art dealer of the old school with a tremendous knowledge of the works of art she handled and an extremely good eye. And she placed a number of great objects, both through sale and gift in the Metropolitan Museum and elsewhere."         The Blumkas also made gifts of art objects and antiques to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Gallery in Washington, the Minneapolis Museum of Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Louvre in Paris. She was a member of the National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America and a participant in the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show each year since its founding in 1989.         Mrs. Blumka, whose name was originally Ruth Zickel, was born and reared in Munich, the daughter of Nadja and Frederic Zickel, dealers in German Expressionist art. She came to New York in 1939, and in 1942 began to work for Mr. Blumka at his East 57th Street gallery.         Mr. Blumka introduced her to medieval and Renaissance art, the field in which his family had specialized in Vienna for several generations. She remained at the gallery after their marriage a decade later. The gallery is now at 101 East 81st Street.         The Blumkas counted among their clients Robert Lehman, Belle and Jack Linsky, Marjorie Merriweather Post and Anne Johnson when she was the wife of Henry Ford 2d.         In addition to her son, a New York art dealer, she is survived by three grandchildren, Kimberly and Justin Nasatir and Amanda Goldberg, and a brother, John Zickel of Carmichael, Calif.       
         Joan Kahn, a book editor whose imprint was a hallmark of suspense stories for many years, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Miss Kahn edited hundreds of suspense novels and her imprint, "A Joan Kahn Book," represented excellence for discriminating mystery lovers. She started the Harper Novels of Suspense during her 34-year career at Harper & Row, and also edited books for Ticknor & Fields, Dutton and St. Martin's Press, from which she retired in 1989.         Through the years, she signed such writers as Dorothy L. Sayers, Dick Francis, Patricia Highsmith, Michael Gilbert, Julian Symons and John Creasey. After Tony Hillerman showed the manuscript of his first novel to his agent at the time, the agent advised him to stick to nonfiction. But it caught the eye of Miss Kahn, then at Harper & Row, which published the book in 1970 as "The Blessing Way."         "She wouldn't discuss the book with me until I had finished it to my satisfaction, then it was open season," Mr. Hillerman recalled yesterday. "But if we disagreed, she'd let me win the argument. She taught me a great deal about writing and was a wonderful woman."         Miss Kahn was born on April 13, 1914, in New York City and attended the Horace Mann School, the Yale School of Art, Barnard College and the Art Students League. She began her career at Harper Brothers in 1946, editing books about history, art, theater and travel, in addition to suspense novels. She wrote two novels -- "To Meet Miss Long" (1943) and "Open House" (1946) -- and four children's books, and edited 11 mystery anthologies.         In 1985, she received the Ellery Queen Award from the Mystery Writers of America for lifetime service to the industry. On her retirement, she received a special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the association for her distinguished career in the publishing of mystery fiction.         She is survived by a sister, Olivia, of Manhattan, and three nephews, Ely J. Kahn 3d of Cohasset, Mass.; Joseph P. Kahn of Sudbury, Mass., and Hamilton R. Kahn of Wellfleet, Mass.       
         Iris Adrian, an actress who played the brassy blonde in scores of films from the 1930's and 40's, died on Sept. 17 at her home in Hollywood. She was 81.         The cause was complications from injuries in the Northridge, Calif., earthquake in January, said her friend Lester Glassner.         Many of Miss Adrian's roles were variations on one character: the gum-chewing, wisecracking blonde who showed up as a waitress, a nightclub floozy or gangster's moll. Among the nearly 150 films she made were "Rumba," her first full-length movie in 1935; "The Road to Zanzibar" (1941), the second of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's "Road" movies; "His Butler's Sister" (1943), with Deanna Durbin, and "The Woman in the Window," a 1944 thriller with Edward G. Robinson.         Iris Adrian Hosletter was born in Los Angeles, and began her career as a dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931, two years after winning a beauty contest. In the 1950's, as movie roles dwindled, she began making television commercials. But her film career picked up in the late 1960's with roles in films such as "The Odd Couple," The Love Bug," "The Apple Dumpling Gang" and "Herbie Goes Bananas." She also appeared in many television shows, including "Get Smart" and "The Ted Knight Show."         No immediate family members survive.       
         Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, died yesterday in Northwest General Hospital in Tucson, Ariz. She was 84.         The cause was an aortic aneurysm, her family said.         Beginning in 1957 with "Calico Captive," Mrs. Speare wrote a string of novels that soon became familiar to thousands of American schoolchildren. Two of her early works, "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" (1958) and "The Bronze Bow" (1961), were awarded the Newbery Medal by the American Library Association.         Among her other novels were "Life in Colonial America" (1964) and "The Prospering" (1967).         Mrs. Speare's last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983), also won the Newbery Medal, as well as the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.         In 1989, Mrs. Speare was awarded the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for her "distinguished, enduring contribution to children's literature." The award cited her "vitality and energy, grace of writing, historical accuracy, and tremendous feeling for place and character."         Her novels have continued to be required reading in classrooms across the country. Her subjects ranged from a boy heroically trying to drive the Romans from Israel to another boy's efforts to survive alone in the wilderness of colonial Maine.         "I have chosen to write historical novels, chiefly, I think, because I enjoy sharing with young people my own ever-fresh astonishment at finding that men and women and boys and girls who lived through the great events of the past were exactly like ourselves, and that they faced every day the same choices, large and small, which daily confront us," she wrote in the New York Times Book Review in 1961.         Mrs. Speare was born in 1908 and reared in Melrose, Mass. She attended Smith College and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Boston University.         She wrote a number of magazine articles and two one-act plays before winning her first award in 1957 with the publication of "Calico Captive," the story of a young woman in 1794 who was carried away to Canada after an Indian raid.         Mrs. Speare is survived by her husband, Alden, and a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Carey of Shaker Heights, Ohio.         Correction:  November 18, 1994, Friday         An obituary on Wednesday about Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, misidentified an award received by her last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983). It was a Newbery Honor Medal from the American Library Association, not a Newbery Medal. The association awarded its top honor, the Newbery Medal, to two of Mrs. Speare's other books.       
         Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a lawyer who helped reshape the American juvenile justice system, died on Wednesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. She was 91 and lived in nearby Scottsdale.         She had suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis argued a landmark 1967 case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that juveniles charged with criminal offenses were entitled to the same procedural protections in juvenile courts that adults enjoyed in the criminal courts.         The case, In re Gault, dated from 1964, when a 15-year-old boy in Globe, Ariz., was accused of making a lewd telephone call to a woman in his neighborhood. Adjudged a delinquent, he faced detention in a reformatory until he turned 21, punishment that was coincidentally far greater than a similarly charged adult, enjoying greater courtroom protections, would have faced.         Mrs. Lewis took the case after the family of the boy, Gerald Gault, had virtually exhausted its appeals. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Arizona affiliate underwrote the effort, but Mrs. Lewis paid her way to Washington and her expenses there. She later said she had been drawn to the case because "I have raised three healthy sons, and I wanted to give something back."         In its 7-to-2 decision in Gerald's favor, the Supreme Court held that he was entitled to the constitutional safeguards that he had been denied: the right to legal counsel, the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to remain silent.         "Neither the 14th Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults only," Justice Abe Fortas wrote for the majority. "Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court."         Mrs. Lewis was born in the Bronx, received her law degree from St. Lawrence Law School (now Brooklyn Law School) and became one of the few women to be admitted to the New York bar in the early 1920's. She practiced in New York for 33 years and was working in the city's juvenile justice system when her husband, Maxwell Lewis, died in 1957.         She then moved to Arizona, where she took the bar examination with just one other woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, who in 1981 became the first woman on the Supreme Court. Mrs. Lewis continued to practice until two years ago.         She is survived by her three sons, Dr. David Lewis of Linkoping, Sweden, Frank Lewis of Phoenix, and Peter Lewis of Baltimore; a sister, Ernestine D. Hanwell of Atlanta; a brother, Paul Dietrich of Ridge, L.I.; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 8, 1994, Thursday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Nov. 19 about Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a former lawyer, misstated her role in a 1967 Supreme Court case that established that juveniles have essentially the same Constitutional safeguards in criminal proceedings as adults. Mrs. Lewis was co-counsel; Prof. Norman Dorsen of New York University Law School presented oral arguments on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.       
         Evelyn Anderson, believed to be the last surviving member of the troupe that danced with Josephine Baker in "La Revue Negre" in Paris in the 1920's, died on Oct. 29 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, her family said.         Miss Anderson was 18 and had worked as a dancer in several shows produced by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake when she was recruited to join a revue, as yet unnamed, going to Paris.         The troupe was formed by a wealthy Chicago woman, Caroline Dudley, who had backed other shows featuring black artists. The star of the revue was to have been a singer and dancer named Maude de Forest. Miss Baker came to the fore when an artist named Paul Colin featured her in a now-famous poster for the show, which the French producers decided to call "La Revue Negre." The show became an instant success and made Miss Baker an international star.         The revue was scheduled to go to Berlin and Moscow after the Paris engagement, but when Miss Baker broke her contract and went to the Folies Bergere, the company broke up. Miss Anderson was among those who chose to remain in Europe, and for the next 15 years she performed in revues and night clubs on the Continent.         When World War II broke out, she was working in the Netherlands, dancing in a cabaret in The Hague, according to Jean-Claude Baker's book about his adoptive mother, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart." When the Germans conquered the Netherlands, they deported her, her partner Harry Watkins and several of her friends.         They were interned first in the Netherlands and later moved to a camp in Germany. In 1943, they were released in a prisoner exchange and made their way back to the United States. In 1944, Miss Anderson married Robert Robbins, an orchestra leader in the Philadelphia area.         She is survived by two brothers, John and Thomas Anderson.       
         Norma Donaldson, whose sensuality and throaty voice entertained Broadway audiences, moviegoers and television viewers, died on Tuesday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Hollywood Hills.         The cause was cancer, said her cousin, Lovely Hill Billups of Washington.         Ms. Donaldson, born in Harlem, became a nightclub singer, touring with Harry Belafonte early in her career. On the concert stage she appeared with performers including Lena Horne, Billy Daniels and Lionel Hampton.         Her most acclaimed appearance on Broadway came in 1976, when she took the girlishly nasal comedy lead of Miss Adelaide, the forever-unmarried show girl, in an all-black revival of Frank Loesser's "Guys and Dolls." Robert Guillaume played Nathan Detroit.         On Broadway she also starred as Missy in "Purlie" and as Evie in "No Place to Be Somebody," both opposite Mr. Guillaume. She was Clara in "The Great White Hope" in Washington and, as a replacement, on Broadway with Yaphet Kotto. She also performed in "The Sunshine Boys," "Bubbling Brown Sugar" and "Kiss Me Kate," among others.         In the movies, she was seen most recently in John Singleton's "Poetic Justice." Other appearances included roles in Robert Townsend's "Five Heart Beats," Sylvester Stallone's "Staying Alive" and Colin Higgins's "Nine to Five."         At her death Ms. Donaldson had the recurring role of Lilliebelle Barber on the CBS daytime series "The Young and the Restless." She appeared in prime-time dramas, as well as in guest roles in the series "All in the Family," "Archie Bunker's Place," "The Jeffersons," "General Hospital" and "Farrell for the People."         In addition to Ms. Billups, Ms. Donaldson is survived by her godmother, Longines Lewis of Mobile, Ala.; and two nieces, Jill B. Beltrans of Yorktown, N.Y., and Jina Billups of Manhattan.       
         Ruth Fizdale, who helped to make modern social work a profession, died on Sunday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86 and a resident of Patterson, N.Y.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke, according to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where she was an adjunct professor emeritus in community medicine.         Miss Fizdale made her mark during 19 years as executive director of the Arthur Lehman Counseling Service in Manhattan. At the service, which is defunct, she developed a fee-for-service system for use by private agencies. The purpose was to lift the welfare aura of charity from them.         Lehman Counseling was created for clients who could afford a reasonable fee. It also paid reasonable salaries, thus bolstering the professional image of its social workers.         Miss Fizdale chronicled the agency's first decade and a half in "Social Agency Structures and Accountability" (Burdick, 1974). The work became a casebook for graduate schools, social agencies and private practitioners as it set standards for social-work services on a fee basis for middle- and upper-income clients.         A month ago, the Columbia University School of Social Work established a Helen Rehr and Ruth Fizdale Professorship of Health and Mental Health. New York State recognized her as Social Worker of the Year in 1970, and a few years ago, the National Association of Social Work set up its Ruth Fizdale Fund in Social Welfare Studies in her honor.         She was long associated with the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and its Department of Community Medicine. She was also an adjunct professor at the Hunter School of Social Work.         Miss Fizdale graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a master's at the Smith College School of Social Work and an advanced-study certificate from the University of Pennsylvania. She was a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers and its Competence Certification Board.         During World War II, she led a Veterans Administration program to restructure its staff and student training. She then served as a psychiatric caseworker at the Jewish Family Service's Mandel Clinic in Brooklyn and with the New York Association for New Americans.       
         Dr. Judith Krieger Gardner, a child psychologist, teacher and researcher at Brandeis University, died of an aneurysm on Saturday at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. She was 51 and lived in Belmont and West Tisbury, Mass.         She fell ill three weeks ago on a trek in Nepal with friends, her family said.         Dr. Gardner was an associate research professor at the Heller Graduate School of Advanced Studies and Social Welfare at Brandeis; she was acting director of the school two years ago.         She also taught a course on the history of child rearing at Harvard University and lectured at Boston University.         Born in Philadelphia, she graduated magna cum laude from the Connecticut College for Women in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard in 1971.         Dr. Gardner was a former research associate at Children's Hospital in Boston and a staff psychologist at the Judge Baker Center in Boston.         She was co-editor with Howard Gardner, her former husband, of many books, including the multivolume series "Classics in Psychology" and "Classics in Child Psychology" published by Ayer.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her daughter, Kerith, of Manhattan; two sons, Jay and Andrew of Belmont, and her parents, Sylvia and Bernard Krieger of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Elizabeth (Biddie) Kramer, a philanthropist who spent most of her life raising millions of dollars for the nation of Israel, died on Monday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1949, Mrs. Kramer and her husband, Benjamin Abrams, the founder and chairman of the Emerson Radio Corporation, visited Israel. At a meeting with Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Finance Minister Eliezer Kaplan , Mr. Abrams suggested issuing bonds to help finance the new nation.         As a result of that conversation, the Israel Bond Campaign was born.  From its inception and for years after Mr. Abrams's death in 1967, Mrs. Kramer remained deeply involved in the campaign, serving at various times as a co-chairwoman, honoree and fund-raiser. Mark Ruben, executive director for Israel Bonds of the Greater Palm Beaches, credited her with raising tens of millions of dollars for Israel.         Mrs. Kramer was also involved in various educational projects, serving as a member of the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and as vice president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University, which bestowed on her the Scopus Award and an honorary doctorate of philosophy in 1984.         She was also the first recipient of the Israel Bond Association's Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial Award for her philanthropic efforts.         A member of Long Island University's board, Mrs. Kramer was a founder of the Benjamin and Elizabeth Abrams Communication Center at the university. She also served on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and as chairwoman of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Appeal in New York City and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Kramer, who survived two other husbands, leaves three daughters, Marjorie Hyman, Geraldine Kory and Cynthia Bernstein, all of New York City; six grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Adda Bozeman Barkhuus, a writer and scholar of international relations at Sarah Lawrence College, died last Saturday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 85.         The cause was complications from a stroke, her family said.         She was professor emeritus of history and international relations at Sarah Lawrence, where she taught from 1947 to 1977. Many of her students went on to careers in the Foreign Service.         Professor Bozeman, as she was known professionally, was the author of many articles and papers as well as influential scholarly books. These include "Politics and Culture in International History: From the Ancient Near East to the Opening of the Modern Age," "Strategic Intelligence & Statecraft: Selected Essays," "Conflict in Africa: Concepts & Realities" and "Regional Conflicts Around Geneva," all of which remain in print.         She was a member of the editorial boards of ORBIS, a Journal of World Affairs; Asian Affairs, an American Review, and the Review for Comparative Study of Civilization.         She was born Adda von Bruemmer into a Baltic German family in Geistershof, Latvia, and graduated from l'Ecole Libre des Sciences Politique in Paris. She studied law in England to become a lawyer at the Middle Temple Inn of Court in London. She practiced with an international firm in Berlin, The Hague and London before moving to the United States in the late 1930's.         She received a doctorate in law at Southern Methodist University and did postgraduate studies at the Hoover Institute of Stanford University before being appointed an associate professor of history at Augustana College in Rockville, Ill. She started as a full professor at Sarah Lawrence in 1947.         Professor Bozeman is survived by her husband of 44 years, Dr. Arne Barkhuus; a daughter, Anya B. Taylor of South Nyack, N.Y.; a brother, Bodo von Bruemmer of Colares, Portugal, and two grandsons.       
         Lilia Skala, a stage and screen actress best known for her portrayal of the headstrong Mother Superior in the 1963 film "Lilies of the Field," died on Sunday at her home in Bay Shore, L.I. She was in her 90's, but her exact date of birth was unknown, her family said.         Miss Skala's performance in "Lilies of the Field," which also starred Sidney Poitier, earned her an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe Award. She appeared in numerous other movies, including "Call Me Madam" with Ethel Merman (both in roles they had in the original Broadway stage version), "Ship of Fools," "Roseland," "Flashdance," "Heartland" and "House of Games." Her last screen appearance was in the 1991 film "Men of Respect."         She was born in Vienna around the turn of the century and graduated from the University of Dresden with a degree in architecture. She was the first female member of the Austrian Association of Engineers and Architects and helped design several buildings in Vienna. But her love for the theater gradually took precedence over architecture. She joined the Max Reinhardt Repertory Theater and eventually became an Austrian stage and screen star.         In 1939, fleeing Hitler, her family immigrated to the United States where her acting career came to a temporary halt until she landed the part of a Swiss housekeeper in the 1941 Broadway production "Letters to Lucerne." Soon, offers of other roles began coming in. She was seen in many Broadway and Off Broadway productions, including "With a Silk Thread," "Arms and the Man," "The Survivors" and a 1986 musical version of "The Shop on Main Street" at the Jewish Repertory Theater.         She also sang the role of Mrs. Peachum in the New York City Opera's 1965 production of "The Threepenny Opera," and appeared on television in shows like "The Goldbergs," "Kraft Theater," "I Remember Mama" and "Search for Tomorrow."         She is survived by two sons, Martin, of Darien, Conn., and Peter, of London; and five grandchildren, Elizabeth, Emily, Justin, Katri and Christopher.       
         Frances T. Freeman Jalet-Cruz, a legal-aid lawyer who fought for more humane conditions in the Texas prison system, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Manor in Trumbull, Conn. She was 84.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jalet (pronounced ja-LAY) was trained in international law but spent much of her career defending prisoners and the indigent. In Texas, newspapers came to label her "St. Frances of Houston" and "Portia of the Poor."         She arrived in the state in 1967 fresh from a course in poverty law at the University of Pennsylvania -- 57 years old and a white-haired mother of five grown children. Supported by a fellowship, she joined the Legal Aid and Defender Society of Travis County in Austin to defend the poor.         A newspaper article about her prompted a Mexican-American inmate and jailhouse lawyer named Fred Arispe Cruz to call her for assistance in appealing his robbery conviction. Hearing of inmates' complaints about what she considered harsh and often illegal treatment from the Texas Department of Corrections, she mounted a campaign on behalf of the prisoners.         She was in the thick of a stormy debate and bitter, costly litigation in the state's prison system in the 1960's and 1970's. She also caused a sensation in 1972 when, at the age of 61, she married Mr. Cruz, 32, after his release from prison. The marriage lasted six years.         The attention eventually led to a broader movement focusing on prison reform, and in the 1980's the Federal courts ordered sweeping changes in prisons statewide.         Her exploits and battle were chronicled in "Texas Prisons: The Walls Came Tumbling Down," by Steve J. Martin and Sheldon Ekland-Olson (Texas Monthly Press, 1987). The book's dedication cited "her unwavering belief in the rule of law."         She was born in Boston and graduated from Radcliffe College before earning advanced degrees at Columbia University Law School, Teachers College and Georgetown Law Center. She worked for the American Association of University Women and in various legal positions in Washington before moving to Texas.         Mrs. Jalet is survived by a son, Tuckerman S. Jalet of Westport, Conn.; four daughters, Jacqueline J. Gordon of Greenwich, Conn., Vanessa Jalet-Stanescu of Manhattan, Roberta J. Kurland of State College, Pa., and Frances Jalet-Miller of Queens, and eight grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Moton Hubbard, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1964 to 1970, making her the top-ranking black woman in the Johnson Administration at the time, died on Sunday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 82.         Ms. Hubbard, who retired in 1970 at the onset of Cushing's disease, an adrenal disorder, died of congestive heart failure, said Marc L. Alper of Rockview, Md., a family friend.         In her State Department post, she worked at developing programs intended to eliminate discrimination against black soldiers during the Vietnam War. She also oversaw the department's public services and news offices.         During World War II, she worked for the Federal Security Agency, helping to organize arrangements for war workers and was a race and human relations consultant. She joined the State Department in 1963 as a coordinator of women's activities.         The daughter of a pioneer in the civil rights movement, Dr. Robert Russa Moton, she grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute, where her father had succeeded its founder, Booker T. Washington, as president. She was educated at Boston University.         Her husband, Maceo W. Hubbard, a Justice Department official, died in 1991. She is survived by two sisters, Catherine Patterson of Exeter, N.H., and Jennie Moton Taylor of Indianapolis.       
         Jean Ickelheimer Stralem, a New York philanthropist and art collector, died on Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 86 and lived on the Upper East Side.         She suffered a long illness, said Lillian Groueff, her former sister-in-law.         Mrs. Stralem, who was born into the Lehman investment banking family, devoted much of her life to the blind and to children with multiple handicaps. One of her principal beneficiaries was the Lighthouse, with which she had a 56-year relationship.         She became a member in 1938, was elected to the board in 1948 and was made vice president in 1973. She also served as vice chairman and continued as an active board member until her death. In the 1950's, she was instrumental in finding community locations for Lighthouse nursery schools.         She began to press for a comprehensive child-development center as early as 1964, and with expansion and renovations at the Lighthouse in 1994, a Jean Stralem Child Development Center was dedicated on her birthday in October.         She often participated in fund-raising benefits, particulary for the American Theater Wing. She was a former board member and officer of the Theater Wing. Other beneficiaries of her philanthropy included Lenox Hill Hospital.         Her private collection included works by Picasso, Matisse, Degas and Renoir, as well as rare first-edition children's books and miniature furniture. Her grandfather, Philip Lehman, was the original owner of the Lehman Art Collection that is now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Her husband, Donald Stralem, a New York banker, died in 1976.         Mrs. Stralem is survived by a daughter, Lynn Stralem of Carmel, Calif.; two granddaughters and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 24, 1994, Saturday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about Jean Ickelheimer Stralem, a New York philanthropist and art collector, misstated her relationship with the American Theater Wing. Mrs. Stralem, who died on Tuesday, was a current and active officer and board member -- not a former one -- at her death.       
         Julie Haydon, the actress who created the role of the fragile Laura Wingfield in the original production of "The Glass Menagerie," died on Saturday in La Crosse, Wis. She was 84.         The cause was abdominal cancer, said Patricia Angelin, the executor of the estate of George Jean Nathan. Miss Haydon was the widow of Nathan, the drama critic.         When "The Glass Menagerie" opened on Broadway in 1945, it immediately established Tennessee Williams's reputation and represented an important return to the theater for Laurette Taylor, who played Amanda Wingfield, a fictional representation of the playwright's mother. Though overshadowed by Miss Taylor, Miss Haydon, as the young girl who cherished her collection of glass figurines, shared in the praise. In his review in The New York Times, Lewis Nichols wrote that she brought "a shy helplessness, a desire to be liked" to a role that was based on Williams's sister.         Miss Haydon was born in Oak Park, Ill. When she was 19, she toured with Minnie Maddern Fiske in "Mrs. Bumpstead Leigh." Two years later, she played Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" at the Hollywood Playhouse. Among her films were "Age of Innocence" (with Irene Dunne), "The Scoundrel" (with Noel Coward) and "A Family Affair," the first in the Andy Hardy series. While appearing on the stage in California in "Autumn Crocus" (with Frances Lederer) she met Nathan.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in Philip Barry's "Bright Star," which closed after seven performances. Several subsequent plays were successes, including Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow and Substance," in which she played a saintly maid, and William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Time of Your Life," in which she created the role of the prostitute Kitty Duval.         Also in the cast of "The Time of Your Life" were Gene Kelly and Eddie Dowling. Later she appeared in Saroyan's "Sweeney in the Trees" and "Hello, Out There," opposite Dowling. Reviewing "Hello, Out There," Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times that together they gave "a lyrical performance of great enchantment."         Dowling was the director as well as a star of "The Glass Menagerie" (in the role based on the author). After that historic production, Miss Haydon acted in several other Broadway plays, including Ferenc Molnar's "Miracle in the Mountains." Her performance in "The Glass Menagerie" remained the high point of her career.         She married Nathan in 1955. After his death in 1958, she made guest appearances in various plays often in community theaters and on college campuses. She also lectured in programs drawn from her husband's many books. In 1962 she left New York and returned to the Midwest. For 10 years she was actress in residence at the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minn.         She played the mother in revivals of "The Glass Menagerie," and in 1980, still petite with a cameo face, she returned to the New York theater to do the role off Broadway, opposite Ms. Angelin as the daughter.         She is survived by her sister, Miriam Donaldson Ziegler of Los Angeles.       
         Kathleen P. Mahon, a lawyer who represented Federal law-enforcement officers, died yesterday at her home in Syosset, L.I. She was 49.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She graduated from Hofstra University and its law school, and was a partner in the firm of Mahon & Berger in Garden City, L.I. For the last 12 years she was general counsel to the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a volunteer organization.         With her partner, Lawrence Berger, she provided legal defense for thousands of law-enforcement officers and investigators facing criminal, civil or administrative charges.         She and her firm helped establish standards to protect officers from harassment, and to shield women, black and Hispanic officers from discrimination within their agencies. She also helped to shape policies on promotion and the dismissal and disciplining of Federal officers.         Ms. Mahon is survived by two daughters, Rebecca and Shana, and two sons, Joshua and Michael, all of Syosset; her father, John Mahon of Amityville, L.I.; and her brothers, Kerry Mahon of Selden, L.I., and Jack Mahon of Naples, Fla.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.
