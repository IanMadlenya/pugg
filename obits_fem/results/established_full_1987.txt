Caroline Gruss, who with her husband donated millions of dollars to educational institutions in this country and in Israel, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan after a long illness. She was 76.  Mrs. Gruss was born in Poland, where she received a law degree and studied classical languages at the University of Lvov. She and her husband, Joseph S. Gruss, an investment banker, came to the United States as refugees in 1939. Other family members stayed behind and became victims of the Nazis.         In later years, Mrs. Gruss frequently said she felt an obligation to perpetuate the Jewish faith by Jewish education, beginning with the very young. With her husband or alone, she made frequent visits to schools. Preferred to Give Quietly         Although they preferred to make their philanthropic gifts quietly, the donations by the Grusses are said to have totaled many millions of dollars.         In 1978, the couple persuaded the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the United Jewish Appeal to join them in establishing the Fund for Jewish Education. The two Jewish groups and the Grusses each contributed $1.5 million yearly to the fund.         The resources were used to improve Jewish education, to increase the capacity of Jewish religious schools to expand enrollment and to provide better benefits to attract highly qualified instructors.         The couple also established the Caroline and Joseph S. Gruss Center in Jerusalem, which serves as Yeshiva University's campus in Jerusalem.         Beside her husband, Mrs. Gruss is survived by a son, Martin D., a daughter, Dr. Evelyn Lipper, a pediatrician and the wife of former Deputy Mayor Kenneth Lipper, all of New York City, and six grandchildren.         A funeral is to be held today at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, at 5 East 62d Street, at 11 A.M. Mrs. Gruss will be buried in Jerusalem after a service Sunday at the Gruss Center.

Elizabeth Kray, a friend and patron of poets for more than 30 years, died of cancer Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         ''With her unique mixture of idealism and common sense,'' said the poet Stanley Kunitz, ''she was the moving spirit behind most of the programs and activities that have made New York the poetry capital of the United States and an international poetry center.''         As executive director of the Academy of American Poets, a position she held from 1963 to 1981, Miss Kray originated in 1966 the Poets-in-the-Schools program, bringing many important poets to schools in New York City, Detroit and Pittsburgh.         She also established literary-historical walking tours under the auspices of the academy in Greenwich Village, Central Park, Harlem, SoHo and elsewhere. In the early 1970's, New York City donated the services of a Staten Island ferry so that patrons of a Walt Whitman walking tour could travel from lower Manhattan to Brooklyn as New Yorkers had traveled in Whitman's day. A Founder of Poets House         After retiring from the academy, Miss Kray, together with Mr. Kunitz, founded Poets House, a meeting place for poets. Many of the books in its library were donated by poets, and Miss Kray donated her entire library, including many rare and inscribed editions.         Miss Kray, who was born Aug. 17, 1916, in Cleveland, graduated from the University of Washington in 1938. After working as a teacher and a resettlement worker for displaced persons, in 1954 she became director of the Poetry Center, YM-YWHA, now known as the 92d Street Y. There she developed tours for poets, obtained a grant from the Bollingen Foundation to commission poets to translate foreign language poetry and arranged the first reading tours of a number of foreign poets. While running the Y's program, Miss Kray also acted as a personal agent for W. H. Auden, E. E. Cummings, Marianne Moore, Edith Sitwell and Stephen Spender.         Miss Kray is the author of ''Four Literary-Historical Walking Tours'' and ''Chelsea 1904-1913: John Sloan's Neighborhood and Neighbors.''         She is survived by her husband, Vladimir Ussachevsky, also of Manhattan, who is now composer in residence at the University of Utah, and a brother, Richard Kray, of Grosse Pointe, Mich. Funeral services will be held at 11 A.M. tomorrow at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street.

''Everybody is so much more sophisticated, and so-called opinion makers are embarrassed by an old-fashioned love story, while young novelists want to write about their identity problems in an impersonal world,'' she said in an interview in The New York Times. ''Times and values have changed, but I still think many women would be happy with an old-fashioned love story.''         Miss Lindley is survived by a brother, Robert Strunsky of Kingston, N.J.; a son, Dr. Charles Lindley of Boston; a stepson, Denver Lindley of Erwinna, Pa., and a grandson.

        Anna Maximilian Potok, a co-founder of Maximilian Furs, whose luxurious styles won her an international audience, died of heart failure yesterday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 89 years old.         Anna Maximilian Potok, a co-founder of Maximilian Furs, whose luxurious styles won her an international audience, died of heart failure yesterday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 89 years old.         Her clients included Nancy Reagan, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Claude Pompidou, Diana Ross and Sophia Loren.         Mrs. Potok was known for her use of sumptuous furs, especially sable, chinchilla, mink, broadtail and ermine. She developed a technique for working sable so the skins looked fatter and more opulent than those used by other furriers. She also liked combinations of furs, like broadtail with mink or sable. Born in Warsaw         She was born in Warsaw, where she studied art until the age of 19, when her father died. She then joined her brother, Maximilian Apfelbaum, in his fur salon. They were the third generation of their family in the fur business.         In 1939 the family fled Poland just before the German invasion and established a fur salon in New York City soon after. It has been at 20 West 57th Street since 1942.         Among her first customers were Helena Rubinstein, the cosmetics executive, and the Duchess of Windsor, for whom she designed the first fur suit. It was in Russian broadtail.         Mrs. Potok is also credited with making floor-length fur coats popular for evening wear. Known as a technician in fur, she used mink with the hair brushed upward so that it resembled sable, and she specialized in dyeing furs unnatural colors, like yellow.         She also made spotted mink coats that looked like leopard and some with feather markings. Maximilian received Coty Awards in 1948 and l965 for making fur fashionable. In Control of Business         With the death in 1953 of her brother, who had changed his name legally to Michael Maximilian, she assumed control of the business. She also adopted Maximilian as her middle name. Her husband, Leon, an engineer, died in 1965.         Fifteen years ago Mrs. Potok sold Maximilian to the Arthur Bartfeld Group, dealers in fur skins, with headquarters in London. But she continued as a consultant until six months ago, advising clients on their choice of furs, including some whose mothers and grandmothers had been her clients in Warsaw.         ''She kept her customers' loyalty because she was a perfectionist,'' said Leonad Hankin, senior adviser to Maximilian. ''Sometimes they came in with a sable coat that was 15 years old, and it looked as if it were bought yesterday.''         A memorial service is planned for Mrs. Potok's birthday, June 4, when she would have been 90 years old.         Her son, Andrew, of Plainfield, Vt., and two grandchildren survive.

She also wrote 13 books, including, ''A New Woman,'' and ''Living With Cancer in New York.'' She founded a monthly newsletter for Japanse career women.         She was one of the first Japanese journalists to tackle the topic of cancer, and shocked some people with her forthright descriptions of how the disease had affected her life.         In one book, ''Cancer Can't Defeat Me,'' Miss Chiba criticized the Japanese medical establishment and condemned the Japanese public's general insensitivity to cancer patients. Writing Until the End         In a 1981 interview, Miss Chiba said, ''Now I know how I will die, writing something until the end.'' And friends said that she was worrying about deadlines until two days before her death.         All proceeds from the sale of her property will go toward a fund for journalists from developing nations in Asia.         Miss Chiba is survived by her mother and three sisters, Nobuko Matsuura, Fumiko Chiba and Haruko Chiba, all of Tokyo.
