         Jeanne Sauve, a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada in the 1980's, died on Tuesday in Montreal. She was 70.         Her death was announced by the office of the Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II. It did not give the cause of death.         A former television journalist and freelance columnist, Mrs. Sauve entered politics in 1972 by winning election as a Member of Parliament from a district outside Montreal now known as Laval-les-Rapides.         After two years as a back-bencher, she was named as a junior minister in the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, overseeing science and technology and eventually the environment and communications. A Difficult Passage         But it was as Speaker, the keeper of the rules and traditions in the lower house, that Mrs. Sauve broke barriers and gained a national reputation.         When she was named to the post in 1980, she was still best known as part of a political elite that had congregated in Montreal in the 1950's to discuss art and politics and nationalism.         One participant was Mr. Trudeau, then a law professor and editor; another was Rene Levesque, a radio commentator who would later became a secessionist and Premier of Quebec, and a major adversary of Mr. Trudeau.         Her appointment drew criticism. Not only was she the first woman to preside over a forum that is still overwhelmingly male, but she was viewed by the Conservative opposition as lacking established ties to the House and knowledge of its often baroque procedures.         In her first two years, Mrs. Sauve was severely tested by strategists from the opposition who barraged her with points of order and privilege. But eventually even her adversaries paid tribute to her firmness and fairness, and she remained Speaker until 1984. Finally Won Respect         When Mr. Trudeau named her to the largely ceremonial but highly respected position of Governor General, she was also the first woman in that post, where she served until 1990.         Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit in Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, on April 26, 1922. She was educated at the University of Ottawa and University of Paris.         In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman who also served as a minister to Mr. Trudeau; he died last year. She is survived by a son, Jean-Francois.         Correction:  January 29, 1993, Friday         An obituary headline yesterday about a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada misidentified her. She was Jeanne Sauve.       
         Laura Dubman Fratti, a child prodigy whose expertise as a classical pianist won her critical acclaim in the 1930's and 40's in San Francisco, New York and Paris, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         Her husband, Mario Fratti, a playwright and a professor of Italian at Hunter College, said she died after kidney failure. Mrs. Fratti had cancer.         She was born in San Francisco and gave her first concert there when she was 5. By her teens, she was praised for her skill. She studied privately with Arthur Rubinstein, among others.         In 1941, she appeared at Town Hall in New York. Newspapers predicted a bright future for her on the concert stage, but she turned to teaching and became a sought-after instructor of piano technique in the 1950's. She retired four years ago.         For a time, she worked for MGM Studios in Hollywood. Her playing was heard in the 1970 film "Love Story," among others. She also coached many actors, including Katharine Hepburn, teaching them how to appear to be playing the piano for movie close-ups.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Valentina Fratti, an actress who lives in New York, and a nephew, Paul Dubman of San Francisco. A memorial service will be held on Saturday 11 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue, Manhattan.       
         Mitzi Berger Hamovitch, an English professor who taught at Queens College for more than 30 years, died on Thursday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. She was 68 and lived in Great Neck.         She died after heart surgery, said her husband, William Hamovitch, a retired economics professor and provost at Queens College.         She was the editor of "The Hound & Horn Letters" (University of Georgia Press, 1982). The book was a collection of letters between the editor of the Hound & Horn, a literary magazine published between 1927 and 1934, and the magazine's writers.         Born in Montreal, she moved to Buffalo in 1946 with her husband and earned her master's degree in English at the University of Buffalo. In 1953, the couple began teaching at Queens College. In 1978, she earned her doctorate from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She retired in 1989.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Susan Hamovitch of Brooklyn, and a brother, Monty Berger of Montreal.       
         Jean Strachan Wilson, professor emeritus of history at Smith College, died Monday at Pennswood Village in Newtown, Pa. She was 89.         She died of heart failure, said Prof. Elizabeth von Klemperer of Smith.         A native of Duluth, Minn., Professor Wilson graduated from Smith in 1924 and earned a doctorate from the University of London in 1927. She joined the Smith faculty that year and taught there until her retirement in 1968.         Professor Wilson was an authority on 17th-century England. In 1963 she was appointed the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor of History. In 1969, after her retirement from Smith, she taught at the University of Iowa.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Diana Brewster Clark, an educator and an authority on dyslexia, died at her home in Manhattan on Sunday. She was 56.         Her daughter, Elise S. Pettus of Manhattan, said the cause of death was uterine cancer.         Dr. Clark was recognized for her research on remedial education for dyslexia. Her book, "Dyslexia; Theory and Practice of Remedial Instruction" (York Press, 1988), is a standard text on the subject.         In the preface to this work, Dr. Clark writes that despite considerable knowledge acquired over the last 50 years about the nature of dyslexia, a perception disorder that confuses images, it may be a long time before effective treatment is widely available. Instructional Methods         Noting that remedial practice "cannot afford to wait" for research, she presents a comprehensive study of existing instructional methods and programs for dyslexic students.         At the time of her death, Dr. Clark was an adjunct professor of education at Columbia University Teachers College and an active member of the Columbia Teachers College Alumni Council, of which she was moderator in 1988 and 1989. She was also a trustee of the New York City School Volunteers and a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society, the national advocacy group.         Dr. Clark, who was born in Manhattan, attended Vassar College and graduated from Barnard College in 1959. She received a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia in 1984. Taught at Marymount         As a learning disabilities specialist, Dr. Clark taught the teaching of reading to children and young adults at the Nightingale-Bamford School and at the Communications and Learning Center of Marymount Manhattan College.         Her latest work was a chapter on early reading and instruction in the book, "Learning About Learning Disabilities" (Academic Press, 1991).         She was a board member of the Shaker Museum and the Columbia County Land Conservancy, both in Chatham, N.Y.         Two marriages, to Thomas W. Pettus and to James M. Clark, ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter Elise, Dr. Clark is survived by a daughter, Ashley S. Pettus, and a son, Brewster W. Pettus, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Whitney Armstrong and Janet York of Manhattan, and a brother, Benjamin Brewster, also of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Roberta G. Simmons, a sociologist who conducted groundbreaking research into the emotional effects of organ transplants, died Monday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. She was 55 and lived in Pittsburgh.         She had breast cancer for 15 years, said Gabriella Stern, a family friend.         As a professor of sociology and psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Simmons was one of the first to study the psychological consequences of organ transplants for both donors and recipients. She found, for example, that a transplanted organ was considered a priceless gift by some recipients and a burdensome debt by others.         "She was really way ahead of her time," said Lin McGaw, manager of education at the United Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, which links donors with recipients. "Her work had a lot of sociological value about what donation means to the donor family and the recipient."         Dr. Norman B. Levy, a professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College in Valhalla, said Dr. Simmons's most important research focused on kidney transplants. "Her work essentially has shown that people who donate kidneys adapt better psychologically and sociologically than most people had thought they would," he said.         Dr. Simmons was born in Boston on Nov. 30, 1937. She attended Wellesley College and earned her doctorate in sociology at Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Richard L. Simmons; two daughters, Nicole Simmons of Bethesda, Md., and Janine Simmons of Los Angeles, and her father, Dr. Burton C. Grodberg of Saugus, Mass.       
         Dorothy Van Doren, author, editor and widow of the poet and critic Mark Van Doren, died on Sunday at the Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn., where she lived. She was 96.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son John, of Evanston, Ill.         Mrs. Van Doren was born in San Francisco, but grew up in New York City. She was a graduate of Barnard College.         She published four novels, including "Those First Affections" (1938), a highly praised effort to create the subjective world of a young girl.         Later, she turned to light-hearted autobiography. "The Country Wife" (1950) was an informal discourse on matrimony, parenthood and life as an amateur farmer in Connecticut. "The Professor and I" (1959) told of life with her husband the poet, and "Men, Women and Cats" (1960) reported further observations on family life.         She was for many years an editor on The Nation, and during World War II ran the English desk at the Office of War Information, which later became Voice of America.         Her husband died in 1972. In addition to her son John, she is survived by another son, Charles, of Cornwall, Conn., and Cortona, Italy, four grandchildren and one great-grandson.       
         Sally A. Provence, professor emeritus in the Child Study Center and the Pediatrics Department at Yale University, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 76 and lived at Branford.         The cause was cancer, said Dr. Albert J. Solnit, a longtime colleague.         For 35 years, Dr. Provence was director of the center's Child Development Unit. She retired in 1986. A pioneer in child development, both as a teacher and researcher, she documented young children's suffering and recovery from deprivation and trauma.         A founder and past president of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs, she received many honors, including the C. Anderson Aldrich Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics.         Born in Wills Point, Tex., she graduated from the Baylor University College of Medicine. Among her many publications, she is best known for her book "Working with Disadvantaged Parents and Their Children" (Yale University Press, 1983).         She is survived by her companion and co-worker, Audrey Naylor of Branford, and a sister, Ada Belle Banta of Wills Point.       
         Barbara Stoler Miller, chairwoman of the Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures Department at Barnard College, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said Beverly Solochek, spokeswoman for the college.         A member of the Barnard faculty since 1968, she was the Samuel R. Milbank Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Culture. Professor Miller was best known for translations of Sanskrit literature, including "The Bhagavad-Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War" (Bantam Books and Columbia University Press, 1986).         She was also an adviser to Peter Brooks on "The Mahabharata," performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987 and broadcast on public television.         Her first marriage, to Dr. James Robert Miller, ended in divorce.         Surviving are her husband, Max Greenwood; a daughter, Gwenn Miller; her mother, Sarah Stoler of Stowe, Vt.; a brother, Will Stoler, of Montpelier, Vt., and her sister, Ann Stoler of Ann Arbor, Mich.       
         Dr. Alice Ettinger, who helped to bring new X-ray techniques to diagnose gastrointestinal illness to the United States and taught radiology for five decades at the Tufts University School of Medicine, died on April 14 at the Norwood Retirement and Nursing Home in Norwood, Mass. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her nephew, Michael Roemer.         Dr. Ettinger was a highly regarded teacher who developed the first radiology residency program at Tufts and practiced at the New England Medical Center in Boston for nearly 40 years.         Alice Ettinger was born in Berlin on Oct. 8, 1899, four years after Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered the X-ray. She received her medical degree from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany, in 1924 and went on to a residency at the Charite Hospital of Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. She received intensive training in radiology from Dr. Hans Heinrich Berg, a pioneer in X-rays of the stomach and intestines. A 1932 Trip Is Crucial         At the time, radiologists had a device, the fluoroscope, that used X-rays to cast an image of the bowel on a screen. But it did not leave a permanent record, and Dr. Berg designed and built a machine, the spot-film device, that captured the fluoroscopic image on film so it could be studied later.         When Tufts asked Dr. Berg for the new device, he sent Dr. Ettinger off in 1932 with the machine in her luggage. Her arrival helped to launch modern gastrointestinal radiology in this country.         She joined the faculty at Tufts that year and remained for the rest of her career. She became clinical professor of radiology in 1950 and was chairwoman of the radiology department from 1959 to 1965, when she became professor emeritus. In 1939 she was made roentgenologist-in-chief at the Boston Dispensary and the New England Medical Center Hospital, and in 1965 she became senior radiologist at the medical center.         She continued as a clinician and teacher at Tufts until 1970, when at age 71 she became a consultant and director of student teaching, overseeing the radiology teaching program at the medical school until 1985 and teaching an elective course. For at least 13 consecutive years, she received the faculty teaching award from the graduating class at Tufts.         Dr. Ettinger's efforts also led to one of the earliest formal training programs for X-ray technologists, at Northeastern University. Among the awards she received was the Gold Medal of the American College of Radiology.         In addition to Mr. Roemer, of Yonkers, she is survived by a niece, Marianne Shoopak of Sunnyvale, Calif.       
         Tess Cogen, a lawyer, psychotherapist and college professor, died on Thursday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 88.         The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         She taught family life and sex education at Pace University for nine years before becoming professor emeritus.         She was a consultant and co-author of a six-volume series on family life and sex education written for students in the fifth to ninth grades.         She was a member of the citywide advisory council of the New York City Board of Education and a member of its curriculum committee on sex education.         Born in Russia in 1904, Mrs. Cogen came to the United States in 1907. She earned a bachelor of laws degree from the Brooklyn Law School of St. Lawrence University in 1925. She practiced law in the late 1920's and early 1930's.         In 1959 Mrs. Cogen graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in psychology from Hunter College, where she was a Phi Beta Kapa. Two years later, she received a master's degree in psychology from Columbia University's Teachers College.         Surviving are her husband of 63 years, Charles Cogen; two sons, Joel, and Edward; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Lillian Batlin Garvey, a family physician who practiced on the Upper East Side for 47 years, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was bone marrow disease, her family said.         The physician, known professionally as Dr. Batlin, continued to see patients until illness overcame her in February. She also taught for many years as a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York Medical College and worked on the staff of Metropolitan Hospital Center and Beth Israel Hospital North.         A native of the city, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard College in 1934 at the age of 18 and earned a master's degree in philosophy at Columbia University a year later. She received her medical degree in 1939 from New York University College of Medicine and was an intern at Bellevue Hospital. She went into private practice in 1946.         Dr. Batlin was a charter member of the American Board of Family Practice, a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a fellow of the American College of Cardiology. She also served as a vice president of the board of governors of the New York University College of Medicine Alumni Association.         Dr. Batlin's husband, Dr. Thomas Quincy Garvey Jr., a neurosurgeon, died in 1972. She is survived by a daughter, Dr. Glenda Garvey of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Thomas Q. Garvey 3d of Potomac, Md., and a grandson.       
         Sylvia A. Boone, a scholar of African and women's art and the first black woman to be granted a tenured professorship at Yale University, died on Tuesday at her home on campus. She was 52.         The cause was heart failure, said a friend, Vera Wells.         Dr. Boone, a professor of art history and Afro-American studies, specialized in African art, female imagery, women's arts and masks.         In Yale's early years of coeducation in the 1970's, she taught a course on black women and served on the executive committee for the women's studies program. She also organized an early conference on black women and founded a black film festival.         Her writings include "Radiance from the Waters: Ideals of Feminine Beauty in Mende Art" (Yale, 1986) and "West African Travels: A Guide to Peoples and Places" (Random House, 1974). Her work won awards, fellowships and grants. She lectured internationally and was a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums.         Dr. Boone was a vice president and scholarship chairwoman of the Roothbert Fund, which aids students training for education careers. She also served on UNICEF's committee for selecting its annual fund-raising holiday greeting cards.         She was instrumental in organizing the 150th anniversary commemoration of the 1839 rebellion of 53 kidnapped Africans on the slave ship Amistad who were jailed in New Haven for mutiny but were eventually freed. She called the episode "a tale of triumph."         A native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Dr. Boone graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in social sciences at Columbia.         Next she studied at the University of Ghana, where she became friendly with visiting black Americans, including Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and W.E.B. Du Bois.         She started at Yale as a visiting lecturer in Afro-American studies in 1970. After earning master's and doctoral degrees in art history there, she joined the faculty in 1979 and was promoted to a tenured, full professor in 1988.         Her survivors include three brothers, J. Herbert, of Newport News, Va., Edgar S., of St. Petersburg, Fla., and John D., of Los Angeles.       
         Dr. Monica Healea, physics professor emeritus and former chairman of the physics department at Vassar College, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 93.         Dr. Healea, who was born in Uhrichsville, Ohio, was a resident of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., until nine years ago. She earned her B.A. and M.A. degrees at Bryn Mawr College and held a Ph.D. from Harvard University. She joined the Vassar faculty in 1933 and retired in 1962.         Dr. Healea published research papers on the interaction of beams of electrons with metal surfaces. During World War II, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she helped develop the magnetron into a power source for an aerial navigation system. Later, she worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory as it was being readied for work on nuclear physics.         After reaching emeritus status at Vassar, she spent several years at Harvard with a group studying the atomic physics of the upper atmosphere.         In retirement she became an artist who exhibited her abstract canvases in Dutchess County and in New York City.  In her 80's, she worked with acrylic paints to explore the interplay of color and design. She was a member of the Dutchess County Art Association and the Mill Street Loft, an arts-education center in Poughkeepsie.         Dr. Healea is survived by a sister, Edith Everett, and a niece, Mildred Barnett, both of Fresno, Calif.       
         Alice Green Fredman, professor emeritus of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and an authority on the 18th- and 19th-century novel, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 68 and lived in Carmel, N.Y.         Her husband, Irwin F. Fredman, said she had had a heart attack.         Dr. Fredman began teaching English at Columbia in 1953 and became a full professor in 1972, retiring in 1991. While most of her career was in the School of General Studies, she also directed graduate studies in the English department from the late 1970's.         She was the author of many articles and books, mainly on English novelists.  At her death, she was working on a critical biography of Mary Shelley.         Her best-known book, "Diderot and Sterne" (Columbia University Press, 1955) won the Clarke F. Ansley Award by Columbia and was reprinted in 1973 by Farrar, Strauss & Giroux. Other books include "Anthony Trollope," published in 1971 by Columbia University Press in its Modern Writers Series.         In 1962, she received a fellowship from The American Council of Learned Societies for postdoctoral research. Twice recently, she refused teaching awards, saying it would be better to encourage younger colleagues.         She was born in New York City. A graduate of Swarthmore College, she earned a master's degree from Smith College and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1953.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Lisa of Baltimore and Catherine of Manhattan, and a sister, Helen Neuburg of Princeton, N.J.       
         Mary Spencer Nay, a painter and retired art professor, died on Saturday at her home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was gastrointestinal illness, said her daughter Malu Nay Block of Provincetown.         Ms. Nay was born in Crestwood, Ky., and graduated from the University of Louisville with a master's degree. She began teaching art at the university in 1942 and was a professor of art education when she retired in 1979.         She settled in Provincetown, where she had spent summers since 1937. She was active in the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, the Heritage Museum, the Historical Association and the Visual Artists Cooperative.         Her paintings, mainly abstractions inspired by Provincetown and her travels in Mexico, hang in numerous museums and private collections. The J. B. Speed Art Museum in Louisville presented a retrospective of her work in 1976.         In addition to her daughter Malu, she is survived by another daughter, Fayette Block, also of Provincetown; a sister, Dorothy Nay Carter of Vine Grove, Ky.; a brother, Benjamin Franklin Nay of Bremerton, Wash., and two grandchildren.       
         Maria Tolstoy, a professor of Russian language and a granddaughter of the novelist Leo Tolstoy, died on Monday at home in Manhattan. She was 85.         She had a brief illness, said Cynthia Whittaker, a friend.         Ms. Tolstoy fled her native Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, resettled in Czechoslovakia, then left there in 1939 to escape the Nazis and World War II.         Arriving by ship in America in 1940, she said, "I believe, with my grandfather, that every person, every country, has a right to freedom." She helped Soviet and German emigres publish political material, worked on foreign broadcasts of Radio Liberty and assisted the United States Army.         Ms. Tolstoy, whose mother was Irish, was fluent in both English and Russian. Her parents met when her father visited Ireland to buy race horses. Active in Politics         She taught Russian at Cornell, Columbia and Indiana Universities, at the University of Michigan and at Hunter College. She retired from Hunter in 1980 but continued tutoring students the rest of her life.         Ms. Tolstoy was active in American politics as a Republican but also supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and was state co-chairwoman of Republicans for Cuomo.         She was also known for her published Russian poetry on the solitude of the emigre. With the recent fall of Communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, she expressed interest in a return visit to her native country but was too frail to make the trip.         Ms. Tolstoy left the Soviet Union in 1925 at the age of 17. She completed her studies for a doctorate in Slavic linguistics at Charles University in Prague, but the Nazis shut down the school before it granted the degree.         Her marriage to Vladimir Mansvetov ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Tatiana Benetkova of Prague, and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Alva C. Cooper, a pioneer in college career counseling and placement and an advocate for minorities and women, died on Friday in New Millford, N.J. She was 83.         Her nephew, John H. Taylor Jr., said she had a long illness.         Dr. Cooper was born in New York City and was a resident of Bayville, L.I.         While she was a professor at Hunter College in New York, she established one of the nation's first on-campus college placement offices. She also helped to found several professional organizations serving the personnel recruitment industry.         She was one of the founders of the Council on Career Development for Minorities and traveled extensively, establishing career offices at colleges and universities with mostly black enrollments and seeking job opportunites for minorities in corporate America.         In 1965, Dr. Cooper was appointed to a task force on the role of women in the military by Secretary of Defense Robert S. MacNamara. She was a member of a task force of 20 women who worked closely with President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in setting a policy for the recruitment of women into the American military and defining their roles.         Dr. Cooper retired from Hunter College as Professor Emeritus in 1976. Her husband, James Cooper, died in 1982.         Survivors include a sister, Rosemarie C. Taylor of River Edge, N.J.; two nieces, Valerie E. Herbstman of East Quogue, L.I., and Jeanne Alva Besley of Bayville, and a nephew, John H. Taylor Jr. of Lattington, L.I.       
         Margaret M. Bryant, an expert on grammar, linguistics, proverbs and folklore, died on Monday at a retirement center in Clemson, S.C. She was 92.

She taught for more than 40 years at Brooklyn College and served as chairwoman of its English department. She also taught at Columbia, Hunter College, the University of Vermont, the University of Colorado, the University of Utah, the University of Arkansas and the New School for Social Research.         Her survivors include a sister, Marie B. Jeter of Ware Shoals, S.C.       
         Muriel Clara Bradbrook, a leading British authority on Shakespeare who taught at Girton College at Cambridge University, died on June 11 in Cambridge. She was 84 and lived there.         Professor Bradbrook, who wrote as M. C. Bradbrook, was the first woman to become a professor of English at Cambridge. She held her professorship from 1965 to 1976 and was the Mistress of Girton from 1968 to 1976.         She was known for her conviction that Shakespeare's writing was "the product of the economic, social and theatrical pressures of his time," as The Independent described it in reporting her death on Saturday. Her views were set out in her books "The Rise of the Common Player" (1962) and "Shakespeare the Craftsman" (1969).         In the United States, Professor Bradbrook was in residence at the Folger Library, in Washington, and at the Huntington Library, in California, in 1958 and 1959; a visiting scholar at Kenyon College, in Ohio, in 1977, and an honorary member of the Modern Language Association of America.         Several of her other books are in print in the United States.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         R. Louise McManus, a leader in nursing education who spent 36 years on the faculty of Teachers College of Columbia University, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Natick, Mass. She was 97 and had lived in Manhattan before retiring to Massachusetts.         Her death came after a brief illness, the college reported.         On the faculty since 1925, Professor McManus served as director of the Division of Nursing Education at Teachers College from 1947 until her retirement in 1961. At the college she founded the Institute of Research and Service in Nursing Education.         Professor McManus was a native of North Smithfield, R.I.         She was a past chairman of the nursing council of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation. Teachers College named its Nursing Education Alumni Medal after her in 1964.         Professor McManus is survived by four daughters, Joan Lawrence of Natick, Madeline Frankenhauser of Falmouth, Mass., Catherine Myers of Wilmington, Del., and Anna McThaden of Seattle; 23 grandchildren, 37 great-grandchildren, and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Florence Turitz Bower, a music teacher for more than 60 years, who headed the voice department at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at home in Newton, Mass. She was 94 and had moved to Newton from New York City recently.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, Joseph, a professor in the Harvard School of Business Administration.         Mrs. Bower joined the faculty of the academy as a voice teacher in 1964, the year it was founded. She soon became chairwoman of the voice department, a position she held until retiring in 1991. Her students ranged from classical recitalists and opera singers to musical theater performers.         Before her work at the Academy, she was a member of the faculty of the Henry Street Settlement House and at the Dalcroze School of Music and taught many private pupils.         She began studying music at an early age and graduated in 1919 from the Institute of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         For the next eight years, she pursued music studies in Paris, Berlin and Florence, where her teachers included Egon Petri, Yvette Guilbert and Bertha Fiering Tapper. When osteoarthritis prevented a career as a pianist, she became an apprentice to a throat surgeon in Paris to study the mechanism of the singing voice.         Besides her son, Joseph L., survivors include a daughter, Ellen Feingold of Newton; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Vivian E. Browne, a professor of art at Rutgers University and a painter whose work linked abstraction to nature, died on July 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was bladder cancer, said her mother, Odessa Browne.         Ms. Browne joined the Rutgers faculty at Newark in 1970 as an instructor in the art and design department. She headed the department from 1975 to 1978, becoming a full professor in 1985. She taught contemporary black and Hispanic art, painting and other courses.         She was a founder of SoHo 20, a Broome Street gallery, established in 1973, that was one of the first women's art cooperatives in Manhattan. There she had several solo exhibitions, most recently in 1989, when she presented her oil and acrylic landscapes of towers and power lines superimposed on trees.         Her paintings are in many private, corporate and public collections.         Ms. Browne was born in Laurel, Fla. She graduated from Hunter College, earned a Master of Fine Arts degree, and studied for a time in Nigeria. Before joining Rutgers, she taught in high schools and colleges in New York and New Jersey.         She is survived, in addition to her mother, by two sisters, Lenice Pannell and Yvonne Allison, of Wheaton, Md.       
         Dr. Mildred Gordon, a cell biologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, Mount Sinai reported.         She was a pioneer in molecular biology as it helped illuminate the process of human reproduction, the hospital said.         Her research broke new ground on the elemental structures of human sperm and the endometrium, or inner lining, of the uterus, that can be detected only with an electron microscope.         Among other things, her work added to the knowledge of nuclear events in the endometrium at the time an embryo is implanted. She was frequently cited for her theories on the role of calcium in the function of the spermatocyte, a stage in the developing male sex cell. At Mount Sinai and City College         Dr. Gordon joined the faculty of the department of cell biology and anatomy at Mount Sinai in 1981 as a professorial lecturer, the title she held at her death. From 1978 until two years ago, she also was a medical professor at the School for Biomedical Education of the City University Medical School at City College and, until 1985, a member of the college's graduate faculty of biochemistry and biology.         Mildred Kobrin Gordon was born in Manhattan and was a biology graduate of City College, with an M.S. in zoology from Tulane University and a Ph.D. in anatomy from Yale University School of Medicine. She had various teaching and research jobs at Yale before joining the State University of New York in Buffalo as an associate professor of anatomical sciences in the mid-1970's.         A statement from City University yesterday said her studies there had furthered in vitro fertilization, adding: "She was always deeply concerned about minority issues, and provided strong suport for minority students, and was a longtime advocate for women in science and medicine."         Dr. Gordon, who was divorced, is survived by two sons, Marc, of Manhattan, and Dr. Jon W. of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a daughter, Sara, of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Maya Wallace of Woodland Hills, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Kathrine Koller, a Renaissance scholar who became the first woman to head a department at the University of Rochester, died on Aug. 17 at a Rochester nursing home. Dr. Koller, a resident of Rochester, was 91.         She had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Koller, a gifted speaker who joined the Rochester faculty in 1942, was chairman of the English department from 1946 to 1958. Beyond her expertise in 17th-century English literature, she was known for her belief in the need of a firm footing in the humanities for young people to help them learn self-discipline and integrity.         She was born in Hudson, N.Y., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wittenberg University and received a doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 1932. She taught high school English in Ohio and was an assistant professor at Bryn Mawr College before she went to Rochester.         There, she was named Joseph H. Gilmore Professor of English in 1948. Under her guidance, the English department nearly doubled its faculty to 20 members and instituted a Ph.D. program for future English teachers.         Her articles on Renaissance literature appeared in scholarly journals. She reached emeritus status in 1967.         In 1950, Dr. Koller married William Diez, professor of political science at Rochester. He died three years ago.       
         Louise Pierce Horwood, a retired public-health worker and civic leader, died on Thursday at a hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 102 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         Mrs. Horwood was active in organizations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied and where her husband, Murray, was a professor. She helped create M.I.T.'s first student residence for women in the late 1940's and was president of the Matrons Association, an organization of wives of faculty and administration members. She was also president of the Women's City Club of Boston.         Mrs. Horwood was born in Chicago and reared in Europe, studying in France and Switzerland. She trained in biology and public health at M.I.T. In Boston she worked in a tuberculosis clinic and on a survey of the worldwide influenza epidemic of 1918. She later worked for the Oklahoma State Tuberculosis and Public Health Association.         Her husband died in 1957.         Survivors include a son, Sargent P., of Hamilton; two daughters, Louise Alden Cohen of Cambridge and Charlotte P. Armstrong of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.         Correction:  August 13, 1993, Friday         An obituary on Wednesday about a retired public health worker who lived in Cambridge, Mass., gave her name incorrectly. She was Louise Peirce Horwood.       
         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Stella Kramrisch, an authority on Indian art, a teacher and a curator, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 97 and lived near Philadelphia.         Born in Mikulov, Austria, on May 29, 1896, Professor Kramrisch earned a doctorate of philosophy in Vienna in 1919. When she became the first professor of Indian art at the University of Calcutta in 1923 and published "Principles of Indian Art" in 1924, Professor Kramrisch laid the foundations for the systematic study of Indian art.         She personified that systematic study in the series of books that followed: "Indian Sculpture" (1932), "A Survey of Painting in the Deccan" (1937), "Indian Terracottas" (1939), "The Hindu Temple" (1946) and "Arts and Crafts of Travancore" (1948).         From 1932 to 1950 the professor co-edited the Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art. From 1937 to 1941 she lectured on Indian art at the Courtauld Institute in London. In 1950 she moved to the United States, where she was both professor of South Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania, and curator of Indian art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1964 she was appointed professor of Indian art at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.         Apart from teaching and writing, she was highly regarded as an exhibition organizer. Examples of her skill were "The Art of Nepal and Tibet" (1960), "Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village" (1968) and "Himalayan Art 700-1900" (1978), all at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.         She produced a show, "Manifestations of Siva," for the Philadelphia Museum in 1981. The professor's last exhibition was "Painted Delight," a show of Mogul paintings, also at the Philadelphia, in 1986.       
         Lillian de la Torre Bueno McCue, an author who specialized in historical mysteries both fictional and nonfictional, died Monday at a nursing home in Colorado Springs, Colo., where she lived. She was 91.         Her pen name was Lillian de la Torre, a part of her maiden name.         Miss de la Torre, a former president of the Mystery Writers of America, wrote for nearly half a century and was working on manuscripts at her death.         Describing herself as a histo-detector, she used scholarly research to delve into old crimes and scandals, especially those in 18th-century Britain and arrive at her own modern solutions.         She defined her work as "the solving of hitherto unexplained mysteries of bygone times" and said her digging was characterized by "a blind alley today, a feat of serendipity tomorrow."         In a related genre of work, she also took real people and events from history and weaved them into fictionalized mystery plots.         Miss de la Torre wrote numerous books, short stories for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, reviews for The New York Times Book Review, poetry and plays, including one produced in Alfred Hitchcock's television series.         Her first book, "Elizabeth Is Missing, or Truth Triumphant" (Knopf, 1945), rebutted 12 theories on the disappearance of a maidservant near the Tower of London in 1753, then offered Miss de la Torre's own answer.         A book review in The Times said she had combined "the scholarly patience of a candidate for a Ph.D." with "the ingenuity of a Nero Wolfe." Joseph Wood Krutch called the book "certainly the best and most ingenious account of the famous Elizabeth Canning mystery."         Another book in that vein was "Villainy Detected" (Appleton-Century, 1947), subtitled "a collection of the most sensational true crimes and most notorious real criminals that blotted the name of Britain in the years 1660 to 1800."         Her most popular fiction was a series of short stories she concocted about Samuel Johnson and James Boswell under the title "Dr. Sam: Johnson, Detector." She said she used "imagined episodes which recall old crimes and frauds, real personalities, places and situations for the nucleus of the plot."         The origin of her career was no mystery. As a girl, she became fascinated with detective stories in her father's library. "I was practically born a detective-story fan and hardly remember a time when I was not addicted," she once said.         But she had not intended to become a writer. It was not until midlife that she did so, when she began recording her speculation about how Johnson might have approached mysteries of his era.         Miss de la Torre was born in Manhattan. She graduated from New Rochelle College and earned master's degrees from Columbia and Harvard-Radcliffe, then taught high school English.         Miss de la Torre was married for 52 years to George McCue, an English professor at Colorado College who died in 1984.         She was a founding member of the Colorado Springs Chorale and sang in it as recently as 1991.         Surviving are a brother, Henry de la Torre Bueno of Oxnard, Calif., and a sister, Helen B. Barton of Tucson, Ariz.

         Ellen Joyce Alter, a Detroit civic leader and bankruptcy lawyer, died on Saturday at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Pontiac, Mich. She was 44.         Her family said the cause was a cerebral aneurysm.         Born in Cambridge, Mass., Mrs. Alter graduated from Brandeis University and the University of Michigan law school. She was an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit and a member of the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Welfare Federation of Metropolitan Detroit.         She was a partner in the law firm of Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer & Weiss, and specialized in the rights of creditors and debtors.         She is survived by her husband, Peter; a son, Daniel; a daughter, Jessica, and her parents.       
         Diana Vincent-Daviss, a professor of law and law librarian at Yale University Law School, died on Tuesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 50.         A spokeswoman for the university said she died of a cerebral aneurysm.         She was appointed law librarian at Yale in 1991 after serving in a similar capacity at New York University for eight years, during which she supervised the expansion of the law library, doubling its physical size.         She was known for her work on the preservation of library materials and was a consultant to more than a dozen law libraries, including libraries in Chile, which she assisted under a grant from the United States Agency for International Development.  Author of Handbooks         She was also involved in the promotion of international human rights and was recently named deputy director of the Orville H. Schell Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale. The center promotes research and assists lawyers and organizations concerned about preserving individual rights and freedoms and acts as a clearing house for information.         She was the author of many articles and handbooks, including a three-part research guide on human rights law that was published by New York University.         She was born in Birmingham, England. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in law at Cambridge and a master's degree in library science at Columbia University in 1972.         Her marriage to Stephen Elias ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Megan Elias of San Rafael, Calif., and two sisters, Elizabeth Christenfeld of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Lucy Vincent-Daviss of Evesham, England.       
         Dr. Daphne A. Roe, a dermatologist and nutrition expert, died on Wednesday at a community hospital in Ithaca, N.Y., after having been injured earlier in the day in an automobile accident near Trumansburg, N.Y. She was 70.         Dr. Roe was a professor emeritus of nutritional sciences at Cornell University. Her expertise ranged from the role of beta carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in protecting the human immune system from sunlight to nutritional deficiencies in the elderly to interactions between drugs and nutrients.         In the last 15 years she taught nutrition to graduate students from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa.         Awards in 1987         Dr. Roe was a fellow of the American Institute of Nutrition. Her honors included the American Medical Association's Joseph B. Goldberger Award in Clinical Nutrition in 1987, and, the same year, the Lederle Award of the American Institute of Nutrition, which described her as "a major contributor to the recognition of drug-induced nutritional deficiencies."         Her most recent research was in nutrition and aging, particularly the role of carotenoids, including beta carotene, in the protection of the immune systems of older people. She found that moderate doses of beta carotene can protect people from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light on the immune system. She also established a link between overexposure to sunlight and reduction of beta carotene in plasma. In Time, the Priesthood         Beta carotene is a nutrient that the human body converts to vitamin A; some researchers believe it plays a role in reducing the risk of cancer.         In 1984, she found that the recommended dietary allowance for riboflavin was insufficient for women who exercise, and proposed a doubling of that level.         Her books included "Drug-Induced Nutritional Deficiencies" (1976), "Alcohol and Diet," (1980), "Nutrition and the Skin" (1986) and "Geriatric Nutrition" (1992).         At the time of her death she was in divinity school, a candidate for the Episcopal priesthood.         Dr. Roe was born in London. She was graduated from the University of London in 1945, where she received her M.D. degree five years later. In 1963, she joined the Cornell faculty.         She is survived by two sons -- Adrian, of Pittsburgh, and David, of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Laura, of Hartford, and a grandson.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Barbara Taylor Schoen, an author and the founder and director of the writing program at the State University of New York at Purchase, died on Thursday at her Purchase home. She was 69.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Schoen, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Bryn Mawr College, cum laude, and Boston University, where she earned a master's degree in physics. While pursuing a doctorate in physics at Boston, she worked on isotope analysis as a technician in the Department of Biophysics of Harvard Medical School.         While raising four children, she began a writing career in the 1950's and saw her short stories first published in Seventeen magazine. Over the years, she also contributed articles on education, personal computers and other subjects to various periodicals.         She was the author of two well-received novels for young readers, "A Place and A Time" (1967) and "A Spark of Joy" (1969), both published by Crowell.         Mrs. Schoen (rhymes with phone) became a teacher-counselor in 1970 at the Cooperative College in Mount Vernon, which was later merged into the College of Letters and Sciences at SUNY-Purchase. At Purchase she became an assistant professor of language arts in 1973 and an associate professor five years later.         A tenured faculty member, she was teaching nine undergraduate courses covering various aspects of writing from poetry to essays to fiction and science. She had been director of the college's Writing Program since 1984. As such she developed a series of courses and a set of creative-writing classes for literature majors hoping to write professionally.         Mrs. Schoen is survived by her husband of 47 years, Donald R.; two sons, Robert of Southport, Conn., and John of Riverside, Conn.; two daughters, Claire Werner of Norwalk, Conn., and Susan Terray of Woods Hole, Mass.; her mother, Caroline Colgate Taylor of Manhattan; a sister, Alice Day of Canberra, Australia; a brother, Howard C. Taylor 3d of Jericho, Vt., and six grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A Boston resident, she was 78.         She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman & Sons funeral homes in Boston.         A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus. For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979. Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.         Born on a farm near Winchester, Va., she became fascinated with fungi that form in garden soil and get into the blood, brain and lungs of humans, where the fungi grow and cause trouble. She told an interviewer after the 1979 award that the fungi "are molds like the ones that grow on bread in the fridge or on damp shoes in the closet."         She trained at Ohio State University, American University, George Washington University and Duke University as well as on the job as a microbiologist. In 1948, she became chief of medical mycology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington.         She left in 1962 to become an associate professor of medical mycology at Harvard University's School of Public Health and advanced to full professor in 1970. Three years later she accepted an appointment as professor of medical sciences at Southern Illinois University and also served as department chairwoman from 1974 until her academic retirement in 1977.         She then worked on foreign-student exchanges for the American Society of Microbiology in what was then the Soviet Union for three years. More recently, she worked as a volunteer at Brigham & Women's Hospital and with battered women in the Boston area.         Professor Campbell is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Flint of Daytona Beach, Fla.       
         Dr. Harriet L. Hardy, a pioneer in occupational medicine and the first woman to become a full professor at Harvard Medical School, died on Wednesday in Boston. She was 87.         Dr. Hardy died from lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system, at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had worked since 1940, hospital officials said.         Dr. Hardy set out to become a country doctor but developed an early interest in toxicology and environmentally related illness. Her investigation of respiratory illness among factory workers in Lynn and Salem, Mass., in the mid-1940's led to the discovery that they had come down with berylliosis, an often fatal disease caused by exposure to the light metal beryllium.         Berylliosis results from inhaling dust or fumes containing beryllium, but the symptoms may not emerge until 10 to 20 years after exposure to even a small amount of the metal. The disease, which develops in only a small percentage of people who are exposed, can produce coughing, shortness of breath, weight loss and scarring of the lungs. Created a Model Registry         Dr. Hardy set up a registry of beryllium illness that the hospital still maintains. The registry became a model for tracking other occupational hazards and establishing guidelines for their control.         In 1947, Dr. Hardy created an occupational medicine clinic at the hospital and remained its director until she retired in 1971. Dr. Hardy also led the occupational medical service at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge for more than 20 years and advised the institute on safety considerations relating to its first nuclear reactor. She also helped coordinate the study of industrial diseases at Dartmouth College.         Dr. Hardy was not the first woman appointed to the Harvard Medical School faculty but was its first full professor. That appointment did not come until the end of her career, in 1971, when she was made clinical professor of medicine.         Dr. Homayoun Kazemi, chief of pulmonary and critical care at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Hardy was "very kind, yet bombastic, never hesitating to express her opinions."         "She spoke her mind, and there was no ambiguity about what she said," Dr. Kazemi said. Began as School Doctor         Harriet Louise Hardy was born in Arlington, Mass., on Sept. 23, 1905. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1928, received her medical degree from Cornell University in 1932, and went on to train as an intern and resident at Philadelphia General Hospital.         She began her career as school doctor at the Northfield School in western Massachusetts. In 1939, Dr. Hardy became college doctor and head of health education at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, where she developed an interest in women's growth and physical fitness.         Her lifelong interest in beryllium poisoning developed from her investigation of a mysterious respiratory illness that had occurred among workers making fluorescent lamps at the General Electric and Sylvania plants on Boston's north shore. Many of those affected were women.         At the time, Dr. Hardy was working on problems of lead poisoning with Dr. Joseph Aubt in Boston. He had been informed of the outbreak and told Dr. Hardy, "Something is happening in the factories, and they don't know what is going on." He encouraged her to investigate.         In linking the illness to beryllium, Dr. Hardy went back to work done in Russia and Germany in the 1920's and 1930's. Wrote a Standard Textbook         She described acute and chronic beryllium poisoning in papers in 1946 and 1947. About the same time, other groups described a similar illness among workers exposed to beryllium in Ohio.         The work of Dr. Hardy and others led to precautions that allowed safer use of beryllium.         Dr. Hardy worked with the Atomic Energy Commission in Los Alamos, N.M., to study hazards associated with nuclear energy. Beryllium is used in nuclear energy plants and the aerospace industry.         Dr. Hardy was a crusader against diseases caused by occupational exposure to dangerous substances. In 1954, she was among the first to link asbestos and cancer. She studied mercury poisoning and anthrax, a bacterial disease, among farm workers and was a pioneer in using drugs known as chelating agents to treat lead poisoning.         Dr. Hardy and Dr. Alice Hamilton, another occupational medicine pioneer, wrote a standard textbook on industrial toxicology. Dr. Hardy was the author of more than 100 scientific papers.         She is survived by four nephews.       
         Tamara Dembo, a psychologist who developed a method to study anger in social situations, died on Sunday at Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Mass. She was 91 and lived in Worcester.         Professor Dembo, who had taught at Clark University in Worcester, did important early work in Gestalt psychology in the United States, particularly in rehabilitation psychology. She developed a method to provoke anger in the subjects of experiments and developed a theory, in keeping with the Gestalt school, that the onset of anger depends more on situations than personality.         She was head of Clark University's Rehabilitation Psychology Training Program from 1962 to 1972 and was one of two recipients of the first research awards from the Division of Rehabilitation Counseling of the American Personnel and Guidance Association. Her research, which focused on problems in returning to a normal life after the loss of limbs or disfigurement, was applied after World War II to help injured veterans. At Clark, she also directed research with children suffering from cerebral palsy. Native of Russia         Professor Dembo was born in Baku, Russia, and grew up in St. Petersburg. She earned her doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1930 and emigrated to the United States before World War II to do research at Smith College, which she continued at Cornell University, the University of Iowa, Mount Holyoke College and Stanford University.         In 1948, she became an associate professor at the New School for Social Research in New York and then a research fellow at Harvard University in 1951. She joined the faculty at Clark University in 1953.         Professor Dembo, who lived on the Clark University campus, retired from active teaching in 1972 and was made a professor emeritus.       
         Genevieve Sanchez Klein, a former member of the New York State Board of Regents and an outspoken critic of sex education and busing to integrate schools, died on Monday at her home in Daytona, Fla. She was 79.         The cause was cancer of the brain and lungs, said Howard Hurwitz, a friend.         Ms. Klein was appointed to the regents board by the New York State Assembly in 1974, after working for nearly 30 years as a physical education instructor and administrator in New York City public schools.         She was chairwoman of the physical education department at Jamaica High School in Queens from the early 1960's until 1973, when she retired from the school system. Before that, she had taught at Bayside High School in Queens. Denied Re-Election         She was working an assistant professor of health at Lehman College of the City University of New York when she was appointed as the second woman ever to serve on the Board of Regents, which supervises all education in the state.         During her three-year term, she frequently voted in the minority to oppose measures on forced busing of children to further integration of schools. She also voted against a set of guidelines to help school districts select textbooks that dealt with sex or included profanity, saying the rules did not protect the right of parents to object to such material.         She sought re-election to a full seven-year term on the board in 1977, but she was defeated by a vote of 108 to 99 by the Assembly, then controlled by Democrats.         After leaving the board, she was active in the anti-abortion movement and lectured on policy for public schools. She was also active in the Family Defense Council, a group based in Queens that campaigned against curriculum changes advocated by former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. She moved to Daytona in 1990.         Ms. Klein graduated from New York University in 1936 and received a master's degree in education from Colorado State College of Education in 1937.         She is survived by two sons, John F., of Orange Park, Fla., and James V., of Bellmont, Calif; a sister, Muriel Zeigler, of Malverne, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973. Mrs. Judge is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Judge Howes of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jeremy of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Nancy Lyman Roelker, a retired professor of European history at Boston University, died Saturday at her home in East Greenwich, R.I. She was 78.         Dr. Roelker was best known for her work on 16th-century France. Her books included "The Paris of Henry of Navarre, as Seen by Pierre de l'Etoile" (1958), and "Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret 1529-1572" (1968). She also edited and translated French scholarly papers.         Her last book, "One King, One Faith: The Parliament of Paris and the Reformations of the 16th Century," is scheduled for publication next year by the University of California Press, which placed it on its "centennial roster" of the 100 most distinguished books it has published since 1895.         In 1985, Professor Roelker was awarded the Gold Medal of Paris for her contributions to the city's history.         She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Radcliffe College and received her master's and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. Her teaching career began at the Concord Academy in Massachusetts in 1937. She later taught at the Winsor School in Boston for 22 years, and in 1963 joined the faculty of Tufts University.         Dr. Roelker came to Boston University as a full professor in 1971 and retired in 1980.         She is survived by a sister, Helen Roelker Kessler of Cambridge, Mass., a nephew and three nieces.       
         Anne Spencer Lindbergh, a writer and the elder daughter of the aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, died Friday at her home in Thetford Center, Vt. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Noel Perrin.         Ms. Lindbergh was one of six children of her famous parents; she was born eight years after the kidnapping and killing of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.         She grew up in Darien, Conn., and, after studying at Radcliffe College for three years, moved to Paris to continue her education. While there she met and married a fellow student at the Sorbonne, Julien Feydy, who became a political scientist and university professor. They later divorced.         She later married Jerzy Sapieyevski, a composer and conductor she met in Europe and with whom she moved to Washington. They also divorced.         In her career as a writer, Ms. Lindbergh wrote 14 books, most of them for children. Her two most recent works are "Three Lives to Live" and "Travel Far, Pay No Fare." She was the recipient of several honors for her work, including an award from the International Reading Association.         Two of her more popular books are "The People in Pineapple Place" and "The Prisoner of Pineapple Place," both written in Washington, where she was then living. Many of the scenic backgrounds were taken from areas in Georgetown close to her home. She also taught school in Washington.         She moved to Vermont in 1987, and the next year she married Mr. Perrin, a writer and professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College. Ms. Lindbergh also taught for several years at the Riverside School in Lyndonville, Vt.         Ms. Lindbergh's mother, who is a poet and essayist, lives in Darien and Barnet, Vt. Her father died in 1974 at his home in Hawaii.         Ms. Lindbergh is also survived by a daughter, Constance Feydy, and a son, Marek Sapieyevski, both of Thetford Center; two step-daughters, Elisabeth Perrin, of Seattle and Amy Perrin, of White River Junction, Vt.; a sister, Reeve Tripp, of Barnet, and three brothers, Jon, of North Bend, Wash., Land, of Missoula, Mont., and Scott, of Brasilia. Brazil.       
         Dr. Mabel Satterlee Ingalls, a bacteriologist who was the last surviving grandchild of J. Pierpont Morgan, died on Tuesday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Sandra van Heerden.         For almost 30 years Dr. Ingalls was associated with a variety of medical and scientific groups, including the Columbia School of Public Health, where she was an adjunct associate professor from 1958 to 1964, and the Albany Medical School, where she taught bacteriology from 1936 to 1943.         She also worked as a liaison officer between the World Health Organization and the United Nations, conducting surveys of health services in developing countries.         Dr. Ingalls was a graduate of Barnard and Radcliffe Colleges and in 1937 received a doctorate in bacteriology and immunology from Columbia University.         She was a fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library, a life member of the Metropolitan Museum, and a founding board member of Goodwill Industries.         In addition to Mrs. van Heerden of Manhattan, Dr. Ingalls is survived by three grandchildren.
