         Mabel Olsen Phillips, who was president of the United Nations Delegations Women's Club from 1971 to 1973, died on Monday at Arlington Hospital in Virginia. She was 75 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said a daughter, Miriam P. Eley.         Mrs. Phillips worked with a number of social and philanthropic organizations around the world as the wife of a career American diplomat, Christopher H. Phillips.         She was elected president of the cultural, philanthropic and social organization in 1971 while her husband was the Deputy Permanent United States Representative, from 1969 to 1973.         Besides her husband and her daughter, of San Francisco, she is survived by another daughter, Victoria P. Corbett of Manhattan; a son, David W., of Mountain View, Calif., and five grandchildren.       
         Anne Homer Doerflinger, a writer whose stories appeared in numerous magazines, died on Tuesday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. She was 87 and lived in Convent Station, N.J.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Writing under the name Anne Homer, Mrs. Doerflinger contributed more than 100 short stories to The Ladies Home Journal, The Saturday Evening Post, Good Housekeeping, Mademoiselle and other magazines.         Mrs. Doerflinger, a 1929 graduate of Smith College, was the daughter of Louise Homer, a noted Metropolitan Opera contralto.         She is survived by her husband, William; three sons, Thomas, of Summit, N.J., Jonathan Warner of Pelham, N.Y., and William Warner of Buffalo; a daughter, Ann Resmond of San Francisco; a sister, Katherine Homer Fryer of Manhattan, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Kathryn Haeseler Stone, a former Virginia legislator who challenged school segregation and a reapportionment plan that penalized urban voters, died last Friday at her home in Alexandria, Va. She was 88 and had been a longtime resident of Arlington, Va.         Elected to the Virginia Legislature five months before the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. the Board of Education in 1954, she became an early promoter of school desegregation. She was among those who argued that the state keep open its public schools and resist the spreading move to privatize schools as a means of resisting integration.         Mrs. Stone was also one of four plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging Virginia's reapportionment plan that reached the Supreme Court in 1964. The suit was joined with similiar efforts in other states that argued that the plans drawn by rural-dominated state legislatures were unfair to more heavily-populated areas. The Court's decision forced the redrawing of districts to balance the representation of urban and rural voters.         A Democrat, she retired from the Virginia House in 1966.         Born in Lisbon, Iowa, she received undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Iowa in 1927 and 1932. With her husband, Harold A. Stone, she undertook in the late 1930's a study of some 25 county and town governments. With Donald K. Price, the Stones wrote two books published by the Public Service Administration in 1940, "City Manager Government in the U.S." and "Case Studies in City Manager Government."         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Paul of Orwell, Vt.; two daughters, Suzanne Stone of Narbeth, Pa., and Joanna Stone of North Leverett, Mass.; a sister, Virginia M. Miller of Chula Vista, Calif.; five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.         Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929.         "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."         As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."         She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."         Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.         In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.         In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."         In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."         The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.         Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Sally Moffet, a stage and television actress, died on Monday at her home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. She was 63.         The cause was lung cancer, said George Dessart, her companion.         Ms. Moffet appeared on Broadway in "The Young and the Fair" (1948), "The Member of the Wedding" (1950) and "Desk Set" (1955). Her Off Broadway credits included Dylan Thomas's "Under Milk Wood" and Tennessee Williams's "Perfect Analysis Given by a Parrot." She also appeared at a number of regional theaters and acted in summer stock companies.         On television, Ms. Moffet had roles in productions by "Studio One," "Armstrong Circle Theater" and "Philco Television Playhouse."         Ms. Moffet's husband, the actor Mike Kellin, died in 1983.         In addition to Mr. Dessart, she is survived by her mother, Sylvia Field of Fall Brook, Calif.; three stepbrothers, James Truex of New York City and Philip and Barry Truex of California; three sons, Harold Dozier of West Nyack, N.Y.; Aaron Dozier of Los Angeles, and Brendan Dozier of San Diego; a daughter, Shauna Kellin of West Nyack, and two grandchildren.       
         Alice Manheim Kaplan, an art collector and a leading supporter of the arts in New York City, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Kaplan was involved with New York City civic groups and with many museums throughout her life. In 1982 she received the Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture.         She was born in Budapest in 1903, and two years later her family moved to New York City, where she grew up. She attended Teachers College of Columbia University but left school to marry in 1925. Years later, she resumed her studies and received a master's degree in art history from Columbia University when she was 63.         For 10 years, from 1967 to 1977, she was the president of the American Federation of the Arts, where she developed many traveling exhibitions and produced an educational film, "The Art of Seeing." She also served on many boards, including those of the Museum of American Folk Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         She headed the advisory council for the department of art and archeology at Columbia University. She was also a member of the visiting committee of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University and served on visiting committees at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was on a committee to save Cooper Union Museum, now the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum.         With her husband, J. M. Kaplan, a financier who founded the J. M. Kaplan Fund in 1945, she was instrumental in the campaign to save Carnegie Hall when it was threatened with demolition in 1960. She was married to Mr. Kaplan for 62 years, until his death in 1987.         Although she insisted throughout her life that she wasn't a collector, Mrs. Kaplan was known for her extraordinary eye and flair. She often bought artworks before the artists were discovered.         On one occasion, browsing through an antique shop, she spotted a neo-classical drawing and bought it for $200. When she returned home and began researching the drawing, she discovered it was a long-lost preliminary study for Jacques Louis David's "Oath of the Horatii," which hangs in the Louvre.         Mrs. Kaplan also bought works by artists like the American painter Ammi Phillips and the Austrian artist Egon Schiele before they were well known. She discovered Schiele's work quite by accident. When she got off the elevator of the Fuller Building on the wrong floor one afternoon, she spotted some drawings by the artist, which she promptly bought. "That's how the collection grew," she once said. "Often the result of chance and circumstance rather than a systematic approach."         Mrs. Kaplan was known for her great style as a hostess, entertaining at her homes in New York City and East Hampton, L.I. In her spare time she was also a portrait painter and pianist.         She is survived by two brothers, Paul E. Manheim of New York City and Frank J. Manheim of London; a sister, Louise Espy of Manhattan; three daughters, the former State Parks Commissioner Joan K. Davidson, Elizabeth K. Fonseca and Mary E. Kaplan, all of Manhattan; a son, Richard D. Kaplan of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Rochelle Pittman, whose legal battle in a tainted blood scandal led to a continuing national inquiry into the state of Canada's blood supplies, died Wednesday at her home in Toronto. She was 57.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said her son Tom Pittman.         Mrs. Pittman is credited with putting a human face on the struggle for redress waged by the more than 1,000 people in Canada who contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through tainted blood and blood products.         "She made a difference in a lot of people's lives," said her lawyer, Ken Arenson. "She got calls from perfect strangers asking her how to deal with this  or that problem."         Her husband, Ken Pittman, a store chain executive, died in 1990 of H.I.V.-related pneumonia without knowing he was infected. He had received a tainted transfusion after cardiac surgery at Toronto General Hospital in 1984.         Dr. Stanley Bain, the family doctor, knew that Mr. Pittman was infected, but  never told the couple because, as the doctor later testified, he feared the information would send Mr. Pittman into a depression. He also said he had mistakenly believed that the couple was no longer having sex.         Five months after her husband died, Mrs. Pittman, who had worked as a jewelry saleswoman in Toronto, was told she also had the virus.         At a news conference in January 1992 at the Ontario legislature, Mrs. Pittman, a tiny, stylish, retiring woman, announced the start of what became a rocky three-year legal battle for redress.         In March last year an Ontario judge awarded her $375,000 in compensation. Dr. Bain, a former President of the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons, was  held 40 percent liable. The Canadian Red Cross and Toronto General Hospital split the remaining amount equally.         In addition, the same institution Dr. Bain had headed found him guilty of misconduct and suspended him from the practice of medicine for two months.         In her decision, an Ontario judge, Susan Lang, wrote that had Mr. Pittman been told, he might have lived two more years and avoided infecting Mrs. Pittman.         For Canada it was a heart-wrenching story, followed in all its intricate twists on newspaper front pages and on national television. At a news conference at the time of the award, Mrs. Pittman observed that while she was happy with the judgment, "No amount of money can compensate me and my family for the loss of a husband and a father. Nor will it change the fact that I will likely experience the same fate."         Her son Tom said that over the last four to six weeks her health went into a  significant decline. "Last Thursday she announced she didn't want to fight any longer. She was determined to have the end come on quickly. But she lingered until Wednesday. The last day she was in a sort of coma."         He said she had been reconciled to the cruelty of her fate. "Anger and bitterness were there, but they didn't consume her in the end. She rose above that."         Mrs. Pittman is survived by her four children: Tom, of Toronto; Mrs. Kelly Blackwood of Kincardine, Ontario; Mark Pittman of Newmarket, Ontario; and Mrs. Kathy Fenton of Toronto; her mother, Mrs. Evelyn Borden, of Toronto; a sister, Mrs. Gail Stanzel of Toronto; and a brother, Dave Winaut, of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and six grandchildren.       
         Julia Adler Foshko, the last surviving member of a generation of Adlers who began their theatrical careers on stage with their parents in the Yiddish theater, died yesterday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 97 and  had been a resident of the Actors Fund Home in Englewood for many years.         Although she was eventually eclipsed by her younger siblings, Stella and Luther, Miss Adler, the middle of the five children of Jacob and Sarah Adler, the founding stars of the American Yiddish theater, had her moments in the spotlight.         Among other Broadway roles in the 1920's, she played Shylock's daughter, Jessica, in the David Warfield production of "The Merchant of Venice," and was cast by David Belasco as the star of "Rosa Machree."         Her last Broadway appearance was in the 1939 revival of the Clifford Odets play "Awake and Sing!" in a part originated by her sister Stella in the initial  production four years earlier. "Julia Adler," wrote Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times, "improves a little upon Stella Adler's playing."         She later toured with her brother Luther in "Tovarich," which appeared at the City Center in 1952.         Like her brothers and sisters -- including two older full siblings, Frances and Jay, and three still older half siblings, Abe, Charles and Celia Adler, born from her father's two previous marriages and an intervening liason in Russia --  Miss Adler began her career early.         The Adler children were generally thrust on stage as toddlers, but Julia, who was born on July 4, 1897, almost broke the record. According to family legend, she arrived moments after her mother had completed a matinee performance in Philadelphia.         There were a lot of Adler mouths to feed, but, fortunately, there were a lot  of parts to go around.         In 1930, the family, including Julia and her mother, Sarah, took 9 of the 10  roles of a George Jessel production, "Millions." The Adlers graciously allowed the director, Joseph Schoenhold, to play the 10 part.         Miss Adler's older siblings, Frances and Jay, died many years ago. Luther, died in 1984 at the age of 81, and Stella, who operated a celebrated Method acting school in New York City, died in 1992 at the age of 91.         Miss Adler, whose husband, Joseph Foshko, the artist, died many years ago, is survived by a daughter, Judy Sure, of Nantucket; three grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
         Anne Ratner, a music patron who kept alive the idea of the music salon, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Ratner put on concerts by first-rate artists in the living room of her Riverside Drive apartment. Among those who appeared, often more than once, were the Emerson and Juilliard Quartets, the singers Arleen Auger and Cecilia Bartoli and the pianists Richard Goode, Jeffrey Kahane and Andras Schiff. Appearance at these evenings became somewhat of a status symbol among musicians, and they often served as showcases for emerging talents.         Ms. Ratner, who organized these evenings by herself, asked each person in the small audiences for at least $30, but personal profit was not on her mind. Ms. Ratner was born in Russia and reared in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She studied the piano and in 1929 married Hyman Ratner. After her husband died in 1960, she taught at the League Center for Seriously Disturbed Children in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The salon concerts -- up to 18 per season -- developed through her work at the center and served as benefit events for the center and for Camphill Village, a community in Copake, N.Y., for mentally handicapped adults.         She is survived by two daughters, Molly Finn of Manhattan and Judy Pitt of Leonia, N.J.; two sisters, Rebecca Jarmon of Forest Hills, Queens, and Mina Gudeon of Sunrise, Fla.; a brother, Saul Kamen of North Hills, L.I., eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Claire Sterling, an American author and correspondent based in Italy, who was known for her writings on terrorism, assassination and crime, died yesterday in a hospital in Arezzo, Italy. She was 76 and lived in outside of Cortona, near Arezzo.         She had cancer of the colon, her husband said.         Mrs. Sterling was based in Italy for more than 30 years and traveled widely. Her most recent book, "Thieves' World: The Threat of the New Global Network of Organized Crime" (1994, Simon & Schuster), was praised by Stephen Handelman, of the Harriman Institute of Advanced Soviet Studies at Columbia University, as making "a significant contribution to post-cold-war debate" by affirming "that the growing interdependence among nation-states and financial institutions has made it easier for crime syndicates to cooperate across national boundaries."         In an earlier book, "Octopus: the Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (1990), she examined the Sicilian Mafia and charged gangster-chieftains based in Palermo with creating a multinational empire with the United States as its longtime main target.         In her 1984 book "The Time of the Assassins," Mrs. Sterling examined the attempt by a Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981. She contended that Mr. Agca had "come to Rome as a professional hit man, hired by a Bulgarian spy ring." She presented what she called "massive proof that the Soviet Union and its surrogates have provided the weapons, training and sanctuary for a worldwide terror network aimed at the destabilization of Western democratic society."         Mrs. Sterling's contention about a Bulgarian role in the attack was disputed, but writing in 1991, she maintained that Italian courts in 1988 had "expressed their moral certainty that Bulgaria's secret service was behind the papal shooting."         She also attracted wide attention with her 1981 book "The Terror Network," which traced connections among terrorist groups around the globe. William Abrahams, who edited the book for Holt, Rinehart & Winston, said that while she was writing it, the Italian Government posted a guard at her house to protect her.         A decade later, the New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis reported that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration, had held up a copy of "The Terror Network" before a group of official intelligence experts and had "said contemptuously that he had learned more from it than from all of them."         Mrs. Sterling's first book was "The Masaryk Case" (1969), about Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister who was reported to have leaped to his death in 1948 from a window of his Prague apartment. She concluded that he had been killed by Soviet or Czechoslovak Stalinists to keep him from defecting to the West.         In her decades abroad, she also wrote articles for The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, The Reporter magazine, Life, Reader's Digest, Harper's, The New Republic, The Washington Post, International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.         Mrs. Sterling was born Claire Neikind in Queens, received a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn College, and worked for a time as a union organizer among electrical workers.         In 1945 she received a master's degree from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, which awarded her a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.         She went on to work in Rome for what she described in a 1981 interview as "a fly-by-night American news agency." She learned Italian, and when the agency went out of business, she returned to the United States and joined the staff of The Reporter magazine, which began publication in early 1949.         Mrs. Sterling recalled that when she applied for the Reporter job, Max Ascoli, the magazine's Italian-born publisher and editor, said, "If anybody's going to write about Italy around here, it's me." So because of her union experience, she became the labor editor.         In 1951, she married Tom Sterling, a writer. She remembered that "Max Ascoli's wedding present to me was a six-month assignment in Rome."         Mrs. Sterling's six-month assignment lasted 17 years, ending only when The Reporter ceased publication in 1968. By then, the Sterlings were accustomed to life in Italy, where Mr. Sterling had written some of his more than a dozen books. So Mrs. Sterling, keeping Italy as her base, began writing her Masaryk book.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Luke, of Cortona; a daughter, Abigail Vazquez of San Francisco; two grandchildren, and a sister, Ethel Braun of Manhattan.       
         Claire K. Tholl, whose recommendation to preserve more than 200 stone houses led New Jersey and the Federal Government to include many of them on a list of protected historic buildings, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 69 and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Tholl was trustee emeritus of the Bergen County Historical Society, a title created for her. She also had been a member of the county's Historic Site Advisory Board since 1969. It was for the board that she conducted a survey of sandstone structures dating as far back as the 1600's.         "The board decided that our stone houses were being threatened with demolition, so funding was acquired and she did the stone house survey in 1979 and 1980," Ruth Van Wagoner, director of the county Office of Cultural and Historic Affairs, said yesterday. "More than 200 were placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, and about 190 were placed on the National Register."         Among the buildings shielded as a result of the survey by Mrs. Tholl was the 282-year-old Steuben House, a mansion of Bergen County sandstone in Dutch Colonial style in River Edge. The mansion was used as a headquarters by George Washington in 1780 and was given to Gen. Friedrich von Steuben as a reward after the Revolutionary War as a reward for being Washington's drillmaster. It was saved by the state from demolition in 1928 through eminent-domain proceedings.         A native of Hackensack, Claire Koch Tholl studied engineering and naval designing at Stevens Institute of Technology and graduated in architecture from Cooper Union in 1947.         She began her historic research in 1944, after working as a draftsman and in boat design, technical illustration and cartography. She later added architectural photography to her interests.         By 1960 she was studying old houses. She advised the restorers of Steuben House, Old Stone Church in Saddle River and Ringwood Manor in Ringwood, among many others.         She also was knowledgeable about early cooking methods and utensils and the kind of foods favored in the past, and the farms that produced them. For the Bicentennial year 1976 she wrote about the foods of the past in the introduction of an illustrated collection of regional and historic recipes.         Mrs. Tholl is survived by two daughters, Lisanne Fogel of Bellingham, Mass., and Andrea Dente of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Robert, of Morristown, N.J., and James, of Queensbury, N.Y., and five grandchildren. Her husband, Edward, an architect, died in 1967.       
         Sylvia Laibman Horwitz, a world traveler, an author and a founder of two schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Paul Horwitz.         When the guns stopped firing in Europe in 1945, Mrs. Horwitz was part of one of the first boatloads of American civilians headed for Italy to join spouses on special assignment on the war-ravaged continent. Her husband, Louis Horwitz, a social worker, was working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in the resettlement of refugees.         She quickly found that the disarray of postwar Rome extended to newcomers as well as to survivors. There was no school for English-speaking children, so she helped start one and served as its first director. The Overseas School of Rome is still in operation. She had already helped found the Downtown Community School, a private elementary school in Greenwich Village, in the early 1940's.         Her tenure in Rome also kindled an interest in archeology.         When her husband was posted in Tunisia, she began to explore the past of her new home and the site of ancient Carthage. Study there and later in Tiberias inspired her third book, "The Find of a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Evans and the Discovery of Knossos" (Viking, 1980). It celebrated the discoveries of one of history's greatest amateur archeologists, Arthur Evans, who uncovered evidence of a Minoan civilization in Crete dating back to 3500 B.C.         She also wrote the books "Toulouse-Lautrec: His World" (Harper, 1973) and "Francisco Goya: Painter of Kings and Demons" (Harper, 1974).         She was born in Newcastle, Pa., and grew up in Cleveland. She graduated from Case Western University in 1932 and moved to Manhattan, where she was a copywriter. Later, she was a teacher at the New School for Social Research.         Her husband died in 1979. In addition to her son, of Concord, Mass., she is survived by a sister, Natalie Barr of Lamoine, Me., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Wednesday about Sylvia Laibman Horwitz of Manhattan, an author and founder of two schools who died on June 18, misidentified the college she attended. Mrs. Horwitz graduated in 1932 from Flora Stone Mather College for Women, not from Case Western Reserve University. The women's college later became part of a university that helped form Case Western Reserve University in 1967.       
         Anne Tabachnick, a figurative artist whose painterly style was inspired by Matisse, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 67.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Felicity Turner.         Ms. Tabachnick was born in New York City in 1927 and studied painting under Hans Hoffman. She earned a B.A. in anthropology and art at Hunter College and also studied art at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York University. Like many artists of her generation, including Larry Rivers, Nell Blaine and her close friend, Robert De Niro Sr., Ms. Tabachnick was familiar with the gestural techniques of Abstract Expressionism, but, looking to Matisse, preferred to used them in portraits, landscapes and figure paintings.         Her first New York show was in 1951 at the Circle in the Square Gallery, and she was later represented by the Ingber Gallery. Her most recent exhibition was at the Erica Meyerovich Gallery in San Francisco in April.         Ms. Tabachnick is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the University Art Museum, Berkeley.         Her marriage to John Newbro ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, of Cambridge, Mass., she is survived by her mother, Freda Tabachnick of Manhattan; a son, David Newbro, also of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Friday about the artist Anne Tabachnick misidentified the San Francisco gallery that held her last exhibition, in April. It was the Eleanor Austerer Gallery, not the Erica Meyerovich.       
         Mary Raffa, the mother of Matilda Cuomo, former First Lady of New York, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I.         She was 91 and lived in Lake Success, N.Y.         Mrs. Raffa was born in Sicily and came to New York City in 1928.         Her husband, Charles, died in 1988. In addition to Matilda, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by another daughter, Nancy Mazzola, of Montville, N.J.; three sons, Frank, of Lake Success; Sam, of Syosset, L.I., and Joseph, of San Diego, 15 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.       
         Ellen Jay Garrison, the widow of the Manhattan attorney Lloyd K. Garrison and a featured performer in the Woody Allen film "Zelig" at the age of 83, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Mrs. Garrison was born in Boston and attended the Brearley School. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1920. In the 1950's she served as president of Women United for the United Nations. A direct descendant of John Jay, she was a longtime trustee of the John Jay Homestead in Bedford, N.Y.         Her husband was a New York lawyer and civil rights advocate who served on numerous Federal agencies and commissions in the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations and was president of the New York City Board of Education in the mid-1960's. He died in 1991.         Mrs. Garrison, who had never acted, caught the attention of the critics with her performance as Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the eccentric psychiatrist whose younger self was played by Mia Farrow. During the film, she delivers a series of monologues ruminating on her tempestuous relationship with Zelig. She was recommended for the role by a friend who knew the film's casting director.         She is survived by two daughters, Clarinda, of Vierset-Barse, Belgium, and Ellen S. Kean of Weston, Conn.; a son, Lloyd, of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Ferry Hooper, a philanthropist who supported art and educational institutions in Baltimore, died on May 27 at the Brightwood Retirement Community in Brooklandville, near Baltimore. She was 85 and lived until recently in North Baltimore.         Mrs. Hooper was born and reared in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the daughter of Dexter Mason Ferry, an insurance executive who was the founder of the Ferry Seed Company, and Jeanette Hawkins. She was a graduate of Vassar College.         In the late 1930's and early 40's, she worked at the Detroit Institute of Arts and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After her marriage in 1945 to Arthur Upshur Hooper, a Baltimore lawyer who died in 1970, she became involved with the Baltimore Museum of Art. She was board president of the museum from 1973 to 1975, a trustee from 1957 to 1977 and an honorary trustee until her death.         Because of her intense interest in modern art, which she collected, a wing of the Baltimore museum was named after her 1981. For several years it housed her gifts of photographs, drawings, sculptures and paintings by Picasso, Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns.         Mrs. Hooper was the president of the Bryn Mawr School in North Baltimore, a private school for girls, from 1963 to 1970. She also headed the building program of its lower school, which she persuaded Marcel Breuer, the Hungarian-born New York architect, to design. Earlier, Mr. Breuer had built and expanded two of her homes.         She is survived by three daughters, Kate Hooper Gorman of Piermont, N.Y.; Jeanette Williams of Mount Washington, Md., and Queene Hooper Foster of Manhattan; a brother, Dexter Ferry of Detroit, and six grandchildren.       
         Vera Aberle Ries, whose living room was lined from floor to ceiling with one of the country's richest private collections of early children's books, died at her home in Forest Hills, Queens, on Monday. She was 86.         Mrs. Ries's husband, Ludwig, began the collection in 1958 with trips to New England villages to rummage at antique stores and thrift shops. Mrs. Ries continued the search after his death in 1968, working mainly through catalogues.         The collection boasts about 3,000 books published between 1600 and 1850, many of them bearing childish scrawls and dogeared pages. Among the books were a moth-eaten first American edition of "Little Goody Two Shoes," a 1780 Bible no bigger than a man's thumb, New England primers, books with paper dolls and collections of fairy tales, along with standbys like "Robinson Crusoe" and "Alice in Wonderland."         "The wonderful thing about this kind of collecting," Mrs. Ries once said, "is that you are giving life to books that otherwise would have rotted away in an attic somewhere."         Born in Frankfurt, Mrs. Ries received a law degree from the University of Frankfurt and arrived in Forest Hills with her husband in the late 1930's. She did not practice law but joined her husband in a window-display business. Together, they worked at some of New York's most fashionable department stores.         Mrs. Ries is survived by her daughter, Dr. Jane Ries Pitt Socolow of Princeton, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Virginia Mae Morrow, the Colorado woman whose hypnosis-induced recollections created a sensation in the 1950's, died on July 12 at a hospice outside Denver. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Richard, said.         According to Mrs. Morrow's own recollections, she had died before, after falling down a flight of stairs in Ireland in 1864, when she was known as Bridey Murphy.         Whether Mrs. Morrow really had a past life as Bridey Murphy, or even if there was a Bridey Murphy who lived the life Mrs. Morrow so vividly described in a thick Irish brogue during in taped hypnotic sessions in 1952 and 1953, has been the subject of intense emotional debate for more than four decades.         The debate began when her story was first told in articles by William J. Barker in The Denver Post in 1954, and it engaged a far wider audience when "The Search for Bridey Murphy" was published by Doubleday in 1956 and made into a movie the same year.         The book was by Morey Bernstein, the amateur hypnotist who had elicited the recollections in Pueblo, Colo. It became a best seller and was reissued in 1965 with additional material by Mr. Barker, but has been out of print for several years.         Whether Mrs. Morrow's account was dismissed out of hand or accepted as proof of reincarnation, Bridey Murphy became a 1950's phenomenon rivaling the Hula-Hoop. There were Bridey Murphy parties ("come as you were") and Bridey Murphy jokes (parents greeting newborns with "Welcome back").         The book triggered an interest in reincarnation and the use of hypnosis to regress a subject to early childhood, and perhaps beyond. It also spawned efforts to debunk Mrs. Morrow's recollections.         The notion that the book was an out-and-out hoax never gained much credence for several reasons. Mr. Bernstein, for example, was a wealthy and highly respected Pueblo businessman who had been experimenting with hypnosis for years.         His hypnosis sessions with Mrs. Morrow, which began on a lark after a party, were conducted in front of respected witnesses who vouched for the apparent authenticity of Mrs. Morrow's regression.         Also, Mrs. Morrow, then a 27-year-old mother of two known as Ginny Tighe, seemed an entirely guileless subject. She insisted that her real name not be used in the book, which called her Ruth Simmons, and then shunned virtually every opportunity to cash in on the Bridey Murphy phenomenon.         Efforts to debunk Bridey Murphy focused on the assumption that her detailed recollections an Irish life a century earlier were simply an outpouring of long-forgotten childhood memories.         In the 1965 edition, Mr. Barker took on the debunkers point by point. Yes, for example, as a child in Chicago Mrs. Morrow had lived across the street from a woman named Bridey (a common diminutive of Bridget), but so what? Mrs. Morrow said she had never known the woman's first name.         As for the visiting aunt of Scotch-Irish extraction who supposedly regaled her with tales from Ireland, the woman was born in New York and had no special interest in Ireland, and Mrs. Morrow was 18, not an impressionable toddler, when she was around.         Mrs. Morrow, whose original name was Reese, was born in Madison, Wis., on April 27, 1925, and raised by an aunt and uncle in Chicago. After studying at Northwestern University, she went with a friend to Denver, where she got a job and met her first husband, Hugh Tighe, who was later transferred to Pueblo.         They later moved back to the Denver area and were divorced.         Whatever the explanation of her highly detailed recollections, the one person who seemed immune to the debate was Mrs. Morrow.         As for all the fuss she had kicked up, she once said, "If I had known what was going to happen I would never have lain down on the couch."         In addition to her husband, of Englewood, Colo., Mrs. Morrow is survived by the three children from her first marriage, Marilou Butler of Valdosta, Ga., Nanci Lee of Hong Kong and Teri Francis of San Jose, Calif.; two stepchildren, Pam Zimmer of El Cajon, Calif., and Randy Morrow of Littleton, Colo., and 10 grandchildren.       
         Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a philanthropist and widow of Samuel Bronfman, founder of the Seagram Company, died yesterday at her home in Montreal. She was 98.         At her death, she was honorary president of the Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Family Foundation, which supports a variety of charitable and community causes. A patron of the arts, she and her husband founded the Samuel Bronfman Collection of Canadian Art. She created a special fund for the Montreal Musem of Fine Arts to encourage young artists through the purchase of their work.         She was active in many organizations, including Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, the National Council of Jewish Women and the Organization for Rehabilitalation through Training.         Born in Plum Coulee, Manitoba, she studied at Havergal Ladies' College in Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba before marrying Mr. Bronfman in 1922. Two years later, the couple moved to Montreal, where Mr. Bronfman opened his first small distillery and built the company into a beverage and distilled spirits empire.         Mrs. Bronfman is survived by a daughter, Phyllis Barbara Lambert of Montreal; two sons, Edgar M. of Manhattan, the chairman of Seagram, and Charles R. of Montreal, co-chairman; 11 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1971.       
         Dr. Ethel Emerson Wortis, a physician long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at the San Simeon Nursing Home in Greenport, L.I. A former resident of New York City, she was 93 and lived in Southold, L.I.         For nearly three decades, she was associated with the Women's City Club of New York, holding various offices, including that of president in the 1950's. She was a past president of the Women's Medical Association of New York City and was active in the League of Women Voters, the Women's Prison Association and the Society of Friends.         Dr. Wortis was born in New York City, the daughter of Dr. Haven Emerson, a former City Commissioner of Health. She graduated from Radcliffe College and, in 1927, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.         Early in her career, she worked as a doctor at the Bronxville School in Bronxville, N.Y. She was later visiting physician at Goldwater Memorial Hospital, on Roosevelt Island, and, in the 1970's, a doctor in the Suffolk County Outreach Unit's mobile health clinic. She retired just over 10 years ago.         Dr. Wortis is survived by two sons, Michael, of Burnaby, British Columbia, and Ethan, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Ruth Cooke of Kennett Square, Pa.; a brother, John H. Emerson of Arlington, Mass., and four grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. S. Bernard Wortis, died in 1969 after 35 years of marriage.       
         Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala. By her own reckoning she was about 85.         When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.         Mrs. Logan, the 14th of 16 children, was born on a farm in Marengo County, outside Sweet Water, about 120 miles north of Mobile.         On the surface, her life was little different from those of other black women of her era in southern Alabama. As a child she picked cotton, sewed and ironed to make money for her family. And for all her infectious optimism and perpetual good cheer, even as a "granny," as midwives were known in the South, Mrs. Logan, the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, was hardly unique.         In 1910, about half of the births in the United States were assisted by midwives, and the percentage was far higher in the rural south. Their clients were generally so poor that even Mrs. Logan, who delivered virtually every child born in the predominantly black Mobile suburb of Prichard from 1931 to 1984, had to supplement her income by working as a maid.         What ultimately set Mrs. Logan apart was not her work, but her compelling sense that hers was a story that had to be told. Or, as she put it, "I just got so much experience in here that I just want to explode."         Although she was barely literate, Mrs. Logan said she was so determined to tell it she would be prepared to "scratch it out" herself.         That proved unnecessary when a family she worked for introduced her to Katherine Clark, a young Harvard graduate who came to Mobile in 1984 to teach English at the University of South Alabama and is now a professor of English at the University of New Orleans.         "As soon as I met her, I knew there was a book in her," Professor Clark said yesterday, recalling that she had taped 100 hours of Mrs. Logan's recollections before editing them into what became "Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story" (Dutton, 1989).         The book, still in print as a Plume paperback, was widely praised both for its vivid accounts of Mrs. Logan's life told in her distinctive vernacular and for her unflinchingly optimistic spirit in the face of pervasive adversity.         "Motherwit" made Mrs. Logan something of a folk hero, and two years ago she was represented along with Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Frank, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Joan Didion and other feminist luminaries in "The Norton Book of Women's Lives" (Norton, 1993).         Although lay midwives were outlawed by the state of Alabama in 1976, Mrs. Logan had attained such stature in Mobile that she was allowed to continue her practice under a permit from local authorities until 1984, when she received an abrupt notice telling her there was no longer a need for her services.         Mrs. Logan, who had delivered babies for almost two decades before receiving a state license in 1949, retired from her profession, but refused to abandon her calling. Despite all the advances in medical services to the poor, she knew that midwives were too often not the alternative to hospitals, but to husbands.         "They're not going to stop me from doing the gift that God give me to do," she said. "I don't be going there on no license. I be going there as a friend to help that husband deliver his baby."         Mrs. Logan, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Roosevelt Logan; a son, Johnnine Watkins of Moss Point, Miss; a sister, Louise Blackman of Pensacola, Fla.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Sylvia Weinberger, who used a sprinkling of matzoh meal, a pinch of salt and a dollop of schmaltzmanship to turn chopped liver into a commercial success, died on July 23 at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 89 and had lived in Boca Raton, Fla.         Mrs. Weinberger started making chopped liver for a luncheonette she and her husband, Irving, had opened in 1944 on the Grand Concourse at 169th Street in the Bronx. She ended up presiding over a $2 million-a-year operation as the proprietor of the semi-eponymous Mrs. Weinberg's Chopped Liver. She once said her name had been shortened because of typographical necessity when her first labels were printed: "My whole name wouldn't fit."         According to her son Richard, Mrs. Weinberg's had become the leading brand of chopped liver at kosher counters from New York to Chicago by the time she retired in 1989. But when it began, it was all Mrs. Weinberger could do to make it acceptable on the Grand Concourse.         At that time, store-bought chopped liver was almost an oxymoron, something to be smuggled home in a plain brown wrapper because no self-respecting Jewish homemaker was likely to admit that she did not have enough bedrock mother love or culinary skills to make it herself.         "I used to give it away," Mrs. Weinberger once said.         Never mind that chopped liver is the metaphorical butt of a Jewish retort ("What am I, chopped liver?"). In many Jewish homes, it is both a staple and a delicacy, one whose proper preparation has been described as the culinary test that divides Jewish moms from Jewish mothers.         Mrs. Weinberger's version apparently passed the test. After much wheedling and cajoling by Mrs. Weinberger, her chopped liver caught on -- so much so, Mrs. Weinberger once recalled, that when she put up a sign, "Mrs. Weinberger's chopped liver with a smile," "People used to say, 'Keep the smile, just give me the liver.' "         As the product became more popular, Mr. Weinberger started soliciting supermarkets in the Bronx. But when the first big order came in, for two cases, his wife was somewhat unprepared.         "We didn't have any boxes or cases," she said. "We delivered the individual containers in plastic bags."         Mrs. Weinberger, a Hungarian refugee, came to the United States in 1937 with two young sons to join her husband. She helped support the family by working as a seamstress while her husband worked in a laundry until they had saved enough to buy the luncheonette.         They sold it in 1955 to manufacture chopped liver full time. Other kosher products, all based on Mrs. Weinberger's recipes, were later added to the Mrs. Weinberg's Food Products line. The family sold the manufacturing company, but Mr. Weinberger continues to be the distributor.         In addition to Richard, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., Mrs. Weinberger is survived by another son, Sidney, of Boca Raton, and six grandchildren.         Correction:  August 3, 1995, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Sylvia Weinberger, who founded Mrs. Weinberg's Chopped Liver, misstated the given name of one of her sons. He is Fred Weinberger, not Richard.       
         Carol Fox Sulzberger, the wife of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, and an active volunteer with foundations and social-service organizations, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, L.I. She was 68.         The cause of her death was cancer.         Mrs. Sulzberger was a director of the New York City Police Foundation. At one time, she also served on the boards of the National Urban League, the New York Urban League, WAIF/International Social Service, the Girl Scouts of Greater New York and the Cooperative Education Association.         "She carried a very heavy schedule without talking a lot about it," a friend, Margaret Greenfield, said yesterday. "She did a lot of good works in a very quiet way."         Mrs. Greenfield and another friend of many years, Sydney Gruson, said friends would remember Mrs. Sulzberger as a woman who jealously guarded the time she spent with her family, her antiques hunting and her passion for the company and conversation of intimates. "She had a wry sense of humor," Mr. Gruson said. "And she was the most direct, honest woman I have ever known."         An avid reader of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger especially championed its coverage of fashion and the arts.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Estelle and David Fox. Mr. Fox had been president of Jay Thorpe, a New York women's specialty store that has since closed.         Educated at the Dalton School, she was a graduate of Goddard College in Vermont. In her youth, she spent a number of years with her family in Paris.         In addition to her husband of 39 years, she is survived by two daughters, Cathy, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Cynthia, of New York City, and two stepchildren, Karen, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Arthur Jr., the publisher of The Times, and seven grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family said that in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the New York City Police Foundation at 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10105.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Alice Greenough Orr, who broke horses as a youngster on a Montana ranch, delivered mail through snowdrifts on horseback as a teen-ager and later reigned for two decades as the rodeo queen of the bronc riders, died on Sunday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 93 and a member of both the Cowboy and the Cowgirl Halls of Fame.         In a career that took her from the wilds of Montana to Madison Square Garden and the capitals of Europe, Mrs. Orr was always at home on a horse. If it was bucking, so much the better.         When she was a child growing up on a ranch near Red Lodge, Mont., her father regularly gave her wild horses, knowing that by the time they got tired of trying to dislodge his tenacious daughter, they would be tame enough for regular people to ride.         In time, her skill would lead to four world saddle bronc championships and make her a star attraction on rodeo tours in the United States, Australia and Europe.         Although bronc riding was her specialty, she and her little sister, Marge Henderson, excelled at virtually every rodeo event from trick riding to bull riding. Together with their brothers Bill and Turk, they became known as the Riding Greenoughs. Like Turk, a legendary bronc rider who died in June at the age of 89, Mrs. Orr also did occasional stunt work for the movies.         Her skill brought her considerable attention. On one European tour in the 1930's she had tea with the Queen of England, and, without benefit of sword, rode fighting bulls into Spanish arenas before dismounting and leaving them to the matadors.         Mrs. Orr, who once said she had been "born liberated," dropped out of school to take over a 35-mile rural mail route at the age of 14. She kept the route for three winters and two summers and had her heart set on a career as a forest ranger until the return of servicemen from World War I closed off such employment opportunities for women.         After the failure of her marriage to Ray Cahill, which produced two children, Mrs. Orr was working in a rooming house in 1929 when she read an advertisement for bronc riders for a wild west show, the precursor of modern rodeos.         She and her sister answered the advertisement and were hired on the spot.         Early competitors were sometimes shortchanged by tour operators, at least until 1936, when Mrs. Orr and others formed what is now known as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.         In the 1940's she and her second husband, Joe Orr, operated their own rodeos, with Mrs. Orr providing exhibitions of saddle bronc riding, a specialty that rodeo experts say requires so much more skill and finesse than bareback riding that it no longer exists as a competitive event on the women's rodeo circuit.         Mrs. Orr retired from rodeos in 1954, but continued to accept occasional movie assignments until she was 80. She climbed into the saddle for the last time in 1992 when she rode in a parade in Red Lodge, where few of those who lined the route could remember the time when it was a girl on horseback who delivered the mail.         In addition to her sister, also of Tucson, she is survived by a son, Jay Cahill of Grandview, Mo.; 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Niuta Titus, whose philanthropy fostered culture and medical research, died on Tuesday in Gstaad, Switzerland, while on vacation. Mrs. Titus, who lived in Manhattan, was 82.         With her husband, Roy V. Titus, the former chairman of the Helena Rubinstein cosmetics empire, who died in 1989, Mrs. Titus supported endeavors like the film program at the Museum of Modern Art, biochemistry at Duke University and ophthalmological research at the Wilmer Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.         She was the president of the Roy and Niuta Titus Foundation, an honorary trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, a director of the Children's Blood Foundation, president of the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem, a member of the international board of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and honorary director of the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which is devoted to the health, education and welfare of women and children.         Many film buffs in New York have pursued their passion at institutions supported by Mr. and Mrs. Titus. Among them were the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the Film Forum as well as the Museum of Modern Art. In 1976, at a time of pressing financial problems for the museum, Mr. Titus and his wife donated $1 million to renovate its 37-year-old auditorium and for its endowment. Six years later, the couple sponsored a second theater, and the auditoriums are named for them.         Despite her high-visibility projects, Mrs. Titus was not a public figure. She enjoyed the company of friends and, in particular, liked a good game of bridge.         She was a member of the Regency Whist Club and the Cavendish Club, a private bridge club, where she met Mr. Titus after she had been widowed twice. They were married in 1960. Twenty years later, they were both still playing bridge at the club.         Mrs. Titus was born in Lithuania, where she grew up. Before World War II, she lived in Paris with her first husband, Benno Slesin, the general manager for Europe for Warner Brothers.         She came to the United States in 1940, and after Mr. Slesin died in an airplane crash in 1947, she marriedBernard Miller, a cutlery manufacturer in England. He died in 1953.         Mrs. Titus is survived by two children of her first marriage, Louis E. Slesin of Manhattan, and Suzanne Slesin Steinberg of Manhattan, an assistant editor in the Home section of The New York Times; and three grandchildren.       
         Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, to which she gave dozens of paintings collected over the years by her and her second husband, Samuel A. Marx, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         The couple came to own what was among the most distinguished collections of modern art in private hands. The collection included the most outstanding collection of early works by Matisse outside Russia, the museum said.         Mrs. Schoenborn became a museum trustee in 1953 and served on the program and drawing comittees. She was a founding member of the museum's international council in 1954.         She was born in Denver. Her father was David May Sr., the founder of May Department Stores, who started his chain in Leadville, Colo. As a young woman, she hoped to study journalism at Columbia University but her father would not permit her to attend.         Forty-four of her paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in a 1965 exhibition, "The School of Paris: Paintings From the Florene May Schoenborn and Samuel A. Marx Collection." Mr. Marx, a successful Chicago architect, died in 1964.         Mrs. Schoenborn donated many important paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints to the museum. The core of her contributions consisted of five paintings by Matisse: "Moroccan Garden" (1912), "Woman on a High Stool" (1914), "Artist and Goldfish" (1914), "Variation on a Still Life by De Heen" (1915) and "The Moroccans" (1915).         The gallery showing Matisse works from the museum's permanent collection was named the Florene May Schoenborn Gallery in 1986.         Her first marriage, to Martin Straus, an advertising executive, ended in divorce. Her third husband, Wolfgang Schoenborn, a developer who helped to turn the old Pacific port of Acapulco into a fashionable resort, died in 1986.         She is survived by five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 1, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, misstated the number of paintings she gave to the museum. Her gifts included five paintings by Matisse and drawings, sculptures and prints by many other artists, not dozens of paintings.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Phyllis Brooks, a popular film and stage actress in the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in Cape Neddick, Me. She was 80.         Miss Brooks, a native of Boise, Idaho, started her career as an artist's model in New York, posing for the magazine illustrator James Montgomery Flagg and others. Hollywood discovered her in 1934 as the "Ipana toothpaste girl," and she appeared in Sidney Toler's Charlie Chan series and the Shirley Temple films "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Little Miss Broadway." Unhappy with her roles, she tried her luck on Broadway, and succeeded with the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber play "Stage Door" (1936) and the hit Ethel Merman musical "Panama Hattie" (1940).         Miss Brooks, who was engaged at one time to Cary Grant, married Torbert H. Macdonald, a wealthy former college football star and hero of World War II, in 1945. He and John F. Kennedy had been college roommates at Harvard.         The Macdonalds settled in Malden, Mass., where Mr. Macdonald was elected to Congress in 1954. He served 11 straight terms, until his death in 1976.         Miss Brooks was active in promoting her husband's political career and that of Kennedy, who was their elder son's godfather. While she declined to move to Washington, she was a frequent hostess on the social scene, especially after Kennedy became President.         She is survived by two sons, Torbert Jr., of York, Me., and Brian, of Salem, Mass.; two daughters, Laurie, of Everett, Mass., and Robin, of Kennebunk, Me.; a brother, Norman Brooks of Cushing, Me., and eight grandchildren.       
         Gloria Wills Landes, a former Broadway showgirl who capped a brief, effervescent career by founding and directing an acclaimed school for aspiring teen-age actors and playwrights, died on Friday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 69.         Mrs. Landes was the director of the SUNY Youth Theater in Purchase, N.Y., until she became ill last year. She had breast cancer, her family said.         If Gloria Wills's days on Broadway had been a Busby Berkeley musical, she would have been the star's funny and bubbly best friend, the one who has her moments in the spotlight but gives up a promising career to marry a rich businessman.         Mrs. Landes's career lasted only three years, but by the time she left a Broadway-bound show in Philadelphia in 1948 to marry Jack Landes, a wealthy silver importer, she had something to tell her grandchildren.  Like hundreds of other stage-struck singers, dancers and actors who have passed through Broadway's revolving door over the years, she had a scrapbook proving that she had been a part of a great tradition.         She may have spent more time auditioning than performing, but she was a Brooklyn girl who could belt out a song, and her persistent auditions at least made an impression on Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers once said she had auditioned for every part in "Oklahoma!" except the villain, Jud Fry.  If she missed a week trying out for the part of Ado Annie, the "girl who can't say no," Hammerstein would ask if she had been sick.         She may not have been a star, but the critic Walter Kerr once called her "one of the funniest things on Broadway," and she had her share of brushes with destiny and Broadway cliches.         In 1945, for example, she was in the chorus of "Carousel" when she discovered new meaning in the old theater good-luck wish of "break a leg." A featured singer got sick, and her understudy, rushing in to replace her, fell down the dressing room steps and actually broke a leg. Mrs. Landes, then all of 19 years old, spent the next six weeks singing "You'll Never Walk Alone."         Then there was the birthday party for "Oklahoma!" She did a comic version of Agnes de Mille's famous second-act ballet that left Miss de Mille in stitches and persuaded Rodgers and Hammerstein to cast her as Beulah, the campus vamp, in the musical "Allegro" in 1947.         That led to a part in the revue "Make Mine Manhattan," with Sid Caesar, but Mrs. Landes, who had doubts about the part and her future in the theater, left the show in Philadelphia to accept what she decided was a better offer: to marry Mr. Landes and live happily ever after.         That is more or less what she did. Several months after she was married, Cole Porter asked her to be Bianca in "Kiss Me Kate," but she was pregnant by then with the first of her four sons.         Unlike many other short-term performers who end up in the suburbs, Mrs. Landes found a second act. After performing in summer stock, she established a school for teen-age performers that was absorbed by the State University of New York at Purchase, where she taught a generation of young actors and playwrights, including Matt Dillon.         Mrs. Landes's husband died in 1989. She is survived by her sons, Mark of Potomac, Md., Dan of Brooklyn, Robert of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Peter of San Rafael, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Herbery Wolfson of Wilmington, Del.       
         Esther Muir, a character actress who began her career on Broadway in the 1920's and went on to appear in some 70 films, died on Aug. 1 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Somers, N.Y.         Ms. Muir started modeling while still in high school in New York City and soon landed a role in a show called "Greenwich Village Follies." She went on to appear in the "Earl Carroll Vanities" and in "International Revue," a show that starred Gertrude Lawrence. Her big break came when she landed the title role in "My Girl Friday!" in 1929. Shortly thereafter, the columnist Walter Winchell introduced her to the Hollywood director and choreographer Busby Berkeley, whom she married. They were divorced in 1931.         In 1936 Ms. Muir toured with the Marx Brothers in a stage production of "A Day at the Races" while they gathered material for the film version, in which she also appeared. Her other screen credits include "I'll Take Romance," "City Girl" and "The Girl and the Gambler."         In the 1950's, Ms. Muir became a real-estate developer in Southern California, overseeing the construction of more than 400 tract homes.         Her second marriage, to the composer and producer Sam Coslow, ended in divorce in 1948.         She is survived by a daughter, Jacqueline Coslow of Manhattan, who is also an actress, and by two grandchildren.       
         Benay Venuta, whose career in show business began as a teen-age dancer in 1925 and ended with a bit part in Woody Allen's 1993 movie, "Manhattan Murder Mystery," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter Patricia Winter.         A singer, actress, radio personality, painter and sculptor, Ms. Venuta was best known as an active participant in New York theater for more than 50 years. Her Broadway career began when, as a virtual unknown, she replaced Ethel Merman, who became her close friend, in Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" in 1935.         Ms. Venuta went on to leading roles on Broadway in such shows as "By Jupiter," "Nellie Bly," "Hazel Flagg," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye" and "Copper and Brass." She toured and played summer stock and regional theaters in "A Little Night Music," "Bus Stop," "Gypsy," "Come Blow Your Horn," "Auntie Mame," "Light Up the Sky" and "Pal Joey."         She also performed at Lincoln Center in revivals of "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Carousel."         In Hollywood, Ms. Venuta appeared in films including "The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown," "Call Me Mister" and "Annie Get Your Gun."         Ms. Venuta was named Benvenuta Rose Crooke at her birth in San Francisco in 1911.         In a 1935 interview, she said that when she quit high school to go into show business she "just added a 'ay' to Ben and the rest I guess you can figure."         Ms. Venuta said her grandfather sent her to a finishing school in Geneva. She dropped out (but not before learning French and Italian), went off to London and came home in 1929 to discover her family was broke.         "My father was dead, and I had to go to work," she said. "You know the rest -- nightclubs, radio, hoofing -- then this."         She was speaking of her big break in "Anything Goes."         For much of her life, Ms. Venuta painted and made sculptures, and for a time in the 1970's her Plexiglas sculptures were sold at Bonwit Teller in Manhattan for $150 to $1,500.         Ms. Venuta was married and divorced three times.         In addition to Ms. Winter, she is survived by another daughter, Deborah Herschel, both of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
         Katharine B. Day, the widow of Clarence Day, author of "Life With Father" and other books, died on Aug. 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         After her husband's death in 1935, Mrs. Day acted as the technical adviser for the Broadway production of "Life With Father" in 1939 and contributed heavily to its sequel, "Life With Mother," in 1948. Both plays were created by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, working from Day's reminiscences of his youth in New York City in the 1880's. Mrs. Day also served as an adviser for the 1947 film adaptation of "Life With Father."         She is survived by a daughter, Wilhelmine; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Frances Webb Roosevelt, a portrait artist who was the mother-in-law of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 78 and lived on the Roosevelt estate, Sagamore Hill, in Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Roosevelt was the widow of President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Quentin Roosevelt.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said Ilene Hoffer, a spokeswoman for Governor Weld.         Mrs. Roosevelt was a native of Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1939. She married Quentin Roosevelt in England in April 1944, two months before her husband, an Army captain, participated in the D-Day invasion. During the war, Mrs. Roosevelt, a Red Cross worker, drew pictures of soldiers on postcards that they later sent home to their families.         After the war, the family moved to Shanghai and lived there until Quentin Roosevelt died in a plane crash near Hong Kong in 1948. Mrs. Roosevelt then moved with her children to Sagamore Hill.         A well-known portrait artist in Oyster Bay, Mrs. Roosevelt taught art at C. W. Post College in Brookville, L.I. During the late 1940's and early 1950's, she worked as a courtroom sketch artist for several newspapers and covered the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, the American diplomat who had been accused of spying for the Soviet Union.         Mrs. Roosevelt is survived by three daughters, Susan Roosevelt Weld of Boston, the wife of Governor Weld; Anna Curtenius Roosevelt of Chicago, and Alexandra Dworkin of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ann S. Belcher, an ear, nose and throat specialist who practiced in the same Manhattan building for more than two-thirds of a century, died at her home in Seattle last month at 100.         For 68 years, from 1924 to 1992, Dr. Belcher's office at 20 East 53d Street attracted patients ranging from neighborhood shop clerks to corporate executives, several generations of Rockefellers and Jacqueline Onassis.         "She believed in treating the whole person," said her daughter, Suzanne Bunzel, noting that her mother was known for the accuracy of her wide-ranging diagnoses beyond her specialty.         Dr. Belcher, whose maiden name was Seligman, was born in Keyport, N.J., on July 6, 1895, and began aiming for a medical career five years later, when she was impressed by two aunts, both physicians, who were visiting from Germany.         She received her undergraduate and medical degrees from Cornell, where she met her husband, Harold, a general practitioner who died in 1988.         Dr. Belcher always found time to indulge her passion for the stock market. Until she was stricken by a gastrointestinal infection two days before her death on Aug. 11, her daughter said, she called her broker every day.         Despite a recent interest in high-technology issues, her favorite was Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Warren E. Buffett, whose greeting on her 100th birthday in July included a request for a stock tip.         Beside Mrs. Bunzel of Los Angeles, Dr. Belcher is survived by another daughter, Kate Webster of Bainbridge Island, Wash., six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Harriet Bell, a polio survivor and advocate of handicapped rights who directed the Polio Information Center from her bedroom as a resource center for the country's 250,000 polio victims, died last Sunday at her home on Roosevelt Island. She was 72.         The cause was cardiac arrest, Cathie Bell, one of her daughters, said.         Crippled by polio in 1954 at the age of 31, Ms. Bell spent the next 25 years living at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, where she helped to raise her three children. As president of the community board of the hospital, Ms. Bell helped to write its patient's bill of rights.         In 1982, she received an award for her work on behalf of patients' rights from the Wonder Woman Foundation, an organization that gives grants to accomplished women over 40. In 1985, she became a co-founder of the Polio Information Center, creating the largest international data base available about the disease. She published the center's newsletter.         Ms. Bell is survived by her three children, Cathie, of Manhattan, and Lori and Douglas, both of Staten Island, and seven grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Robinson Kidder, a philanthropist who founded a program to feed the homeless while continuing her family tradition of support for the arts, died of cancer on Monday at her home in Washington, her family said. She was 78.         Mrs. Kidder was a great-granddaughter of Eben D. Jordan, the founder of the Jordan Marsh department store company and The Boston Globe.         She was a major contributor to dance programs at the Kennedy Center, to the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She contributed to a number of charitable causes through the Hopeful Fund, which she founded to support programs and services for the homeless in Washington.         Born in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., Mrs. Kidder was raised in New York City and Paris. In 1938, she married Randolph Appleton Kidder, a member of the Foreign Service.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Kidder is survived by her son, Michael R. Kidder of New Hampshire, and five grandchildren.       
         Ina Bradley, a lifelong supporter of theater arts in Connecticut, died on Sunday at Norwalk Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Westport, Conn.         Mrs. Bradley, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., served on the board of directors of the Westport Country Playhouse and fought to save the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn.         Mrs. Bradley was also active in radio and television as a weekly panelist on "What in the World," a quiz show, for WTIC-TV in Hartford and as a writer and producer of her own television interview show for WICC-TV in Bridgeport.         She sat on the board of Connecticut Public Television and was the chairman of the program advisory board of WTIC. For the last four decades, she wrote a column, "Fancy Free," for The Fairfield Citizen-News, a weekly newspaper.         Her husband, J. Kenneth Bradley, the Republican state chairman for Connecticut for many years, died in 1969. She is survived by two daughters, Deborah Bradley Donnelly of Roxbury, Conn., and Bonnie Bradley Anderson of Westport; a son, James Peters Bradley of Fairfield, and six grandchildren.       
         Diana Chin Hsu, a veteran Chinese journalist, novelist and poet whose writings on love, suffering and tragedy are read throughout Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, died on Wednesday in Queens. She was 77.         The cause of death was stomach cancer, according to her son, Hugh H. Mo, a lawyer in New York.         As a reporter for Chinese newspapers during World War II, Ms. Hsu covered the Chinese resistance against the Japanese and her articles were widely read in the Far East. But Ms. Hsu gained wider popularity after she escaped Communist China with the three youngest of munists executed her husband, Mo Tze Shin, the director of Chiang Kai-shek's secret police force, the Shanghai Bureau of Criminal Investigation.         Her book "Mao Zedong Killed My Husband" was a best-seller in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.         In 1954, at the invitation of Chiang Ching-kuo, a son of Chiang Kai-shek who later became President of Taiwan, Ms. Hsu visited Taiwan and joined the Government newspaper, China Daily News, where she covered international politics. In 1960, Ms. Hsu became a special foreign correspondent for the paper in New York.         Ms. Hsu traveled through Asia and Europe, eventually settling in New York, and was eventually reunited with her eight children.         She went on to write seven novels, all with anti-Communist themes. Attempts by the Chinese Government to undermine her only enhanced her popularity.         In 1985, the Chinese community in New York was in an uproar when Ms. Hsu and her son, Mr. Mo, who was serving as a Deputy Police Commissioner in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, accepted an invitation from the Chinese Government and visited the mainland. Today, some pro-Taiwan Chinese have not forgiven them.         "Maybe the old generation can't sit down and break bread," Mr. Mo said after his trip to China in 1985. "But the ideological split doesn't involve me."         Ms. Hsu is survived by four daughters, LiYa Mo, Li Qun Mo and Li Guo Mo, all of New York City, and Li Min Mo of Cambridge, Mass., and two other sons, Lin H. Mo and Chi Mo of New York, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Mary-Scott Welch, a writer and feminist leader who fostered the concept of networking to advance a woman's career, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, said Hubert Pryor, her companion.         Ms. Welch wrote "Networking: The Great New Way for Women to Get Ahead" (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1980) in an era when more women were competing for jobs traditionally dominated by men.         Networking, through individual contacts and professional organizations, became an important technique for women to get career advice and make connections. Such contacts also helped offset the competitive advantage men often enjoyed through their own "old boy" network.         Ms. Welch wrote books on varied topics, including wilderness trips, cooking, travel for teen-age girls and etiquette. She was also a freelance magazine writer whose work was published in Redbook, Esquire, Ladies Home Journal, Woman's Day, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Reader's Digest and Modern Maturity. Ms. Welch also worked as an editor at Pageant and Look magazines and was editor in chief of Homemaker's Digest.         She served on advisory boards for Cornell University's Institute for Women and Work and for the National Organization for Women. In the 1970's, she was the coordinator of NOW's Rape Prevention Committee in New York City.         Ms. Welch, who was known as Scotty, was born in Chicago. After graduating from the University of Illinois, she was in the first group of Waves commissioned by the Navy during World War II.         For most of her career, she lived in New York City. She was married to Barrett Welch, a marketing and advertising executive, from 1943 until his death in 1981.         Her survivors include a son, Farley, of Portland, Ore.; three daughters, Laurie Welch of Washington, Margaret Welch of Seattle, and Molly Welch of Greenfield, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Dickson, an American-born musical comedy performer who captivated British audiences in the 1920's and 30's and became a member of the country's theatrical and social elite, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 102.         Until her friend Michael Thornton, the British biographer, tracked down her birth certificate, it had been assumed that Miss Dickson was born on July 20, 1900, the date given in a standard reference work.         But that would have made her a mere 14 in 1914, when as a Chicago debutante she scandalized North Shore society by dropping out of Madame Young's finishing school to form a dance team with Carl Hyson, a wealthy young man who later became her husband.         Before the season was over the pair claimed a long-distance tango record by dancing the equivalent of 22,000 miles at clubs in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York.         A 1900 birth date would also have meant that Miss Dickson was only 16 on Feb. 20, 1917, when she opened as a featured dancer in "Oh Boy!," a Jerome Kern hit that ran for 463 performances at the Princess Theater in New York.         Although she became a Ziegfeld girl and appeared in other Broadway shows, including Kern's "Rock-a-Bye Baby" in 1918, it was not until she got to England in 1921 as the lead in the London company of "Sally" that she became a star. Playing the part made famous by Marilyn Miller in New York a year earlier, Miss Dickson introduced the Kern standard "Look for the Silver Lining" to British audiences, and was a darling of the West End from then on.         She and the show were so successful that Kern and P. G. Wodehouse wrote another one especially for her. "The Cabaret Girl" ran for 361 performances at the Wintergarden Theater there.         It was during the "Cabaret Girl" run that Miss Dickson made one of her most important British conquests, a lasting friendship with Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who was so enchanted with Miss Dickson that she took her fiance to a performance. The fiance, then the Duke of York, eventually became King George VI. The former Lady Elizabeth is the Queen Mother of Britain.         At a birthday lunch Miss Dickson gave at her home in 1980, the Queen Mother demonstrated her own musical-comedy talents by singing a "Cabaret Girl" tune, "Dancing Time." She sent roses for Miss Dickson's 100th-birthday celebration two years ago.         Miss Dickson appeared in many other London productions, including a 1925 revival of "Peter Pan." She also became friends with Noel Coward and other theater luminaries. When she filed for divorce from Mr. Hyson in 1935, it was reported that Miss Dickson was expected to marry a British peer. In fact she never remarried.         Although her career had faded considerably by the 1940's, Miss Dickson re-emerged as a founder of the London Stage Door Canteen, which entertained thousands of Allied troops during World War II.         Her last theater roles were in "Red Letter Day" and "As Long as They Are Happy," in 1953, and she made her last stage appearance in 1980 during a 75th-anniversary celebration of "Peter Pan."         A dedicated Christian Scientist who made daily walks from her Eaton Square apartment to a reading room until she was well into her 90's, Miss Dickson remained a familiar and sprightly figure in London.         In addition to Miss Quayle, she is survived by her daughter, Lady Quayle, the widow of the actor Anthony Quayle; two other grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 29, 1995, Friday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about Dorothy Dickson, a former musical comedy star, referred incompletely to one survivor. She is the actress Jenny Quayle, a granddaughter.       
         Mary Alice Barney Kean, who was long prominent in the historical preservation field, died on Monday at her 223-year-old home, Liberty Hall in Union, N.J. She was 93.         At her death, Mrs. Kean (pronounced cane) was president of the Elizabethtown Historical Foundation in New Jersey. She became the first female trustee of the New-York Historical Society and remained a trustee from 1967 to 1984. Liberty Hall was built for her ancestor William Livingston, New Jersey's first Governor after the American Revolution.         From 1956 through 1960, she was the president general -- the ranking officer -- of the Colonial Dames of America, a Manhattan-based society whose members trace their ancestry to Colonial times. The Colonial Dames own the site on East 61st Street that includes what is now the Abigail Adams Smith Museum, which once stood on an estate owned by President John Adams's daughter Abigail and her husband.         In addition, Mrs. Kean was a governor of the New Jersey Historical Society, which gave her an award for her historic-preservation work. She was active in preservation projects as far afield as Virginia.         Over the years, she was also president of the New York Chapter of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, a directress general of the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames and a trustee of St. Bernard's School in Manhattan and of Cooper Union.         Mr. Kean died in 1949, at 60. He was president of the National State Bank, the Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Company and the Elizabethtown Water Company, all in Elizabeth, N.J. Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, is his nephew.         Mrs. Kean is survived by a daughter, Mary Alice Raynolds of Lander, Wyo.; two sons, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Stewart, of Union, N.J., 9 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Gladys M. Dorman, a lawyer who served 20 years on the New York City Board of Higher Education, died on Thursday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 84.         As a girl growing up in Flatbush, Miss Dorman, who continued to use her maiden name throughout her professional career, became well acquainted with the law.         Her father, Benjamin Dorman, a leading figure in the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, worked his way up through the court system to become chief clerk of the Surrogate's Court in Brooklyn, where Miss Dorman practiced as an estate planner and wills litigator for more than 30 years. She was a partner of Raphael & Dorman with her husband, Benjamin R. Raphael, a Brooklyn Law School classmate whom she married in 1939. He died in 1992.         For all the family precedent, Miss Dorman, who received a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1931, intended an academic career. But after she obtained a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1933, she switched to the law when a post she had been promised as an instructor at Brooklyn College evaporated in Depression economics.         She obtained her degree in 1936, and four years later was one of the first seven women elected to the Brooklyn Bar Association. In 1966, she became the first woman to serve as a trustee.         Miss Dorman's service on the Board of Higher Education, the governing body of the city colleges, began with an interim appointment by Mayor William O'Dwyer in 1949.         Miss Dorman was a member of the board's executive committee and chairwoman of the board's Brooklyn College administrative committee.         She is survived by two sons, both lawyers, Stephen M. Raphael of Brooklyn and Allan H. Raphael of Oak Park, Ill.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Mary M. Kaufman, a retired lawyer whose practice included cases involving Communism and Nazism, as well as defending the poor, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt division of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 82 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaufman retired about 1980, after having worked in Manhattan for almost all her career. Some of her other cases involved antiwar activities. She practiced mainly without partners.         In 1951, she was in a Federal courtroom as a defense lawyer when Dashiell Hammett, the writer, and W. Alphaeus Hunton, secretary of the Council on African Affairs, were convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison.         She asked Judge Sylvester Ryan to release Mr. Hunton in her custody or set bail, but he refused.         Judge Ryan had found Mr. Hammett and Mr. Hunton guilty for refusing to name contributors to the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which the Attorney General had designated as a Communist subversive front. Mrs. Kaufman's clients included the bail fund as well as Mr. Hunton.         In the preceding two years, the civil rights group had posted $500,000 or more bail for Communists accused of criminal conspiracy or involved in deportation cases, and it had forfeited more than $100,000 because of bail jumping.         In the 1940's, Mrs. Kaufman worked for the National War Labor and Wage Stabilization Boards, and she was a prosecutor at a war-crimes trial in Nuremberg.         She was born Mary Metlay in Atlanta, but grew up mainly in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, she received her law degree from St. John's University and was admitted to the bar in 1937. She became an original member of the National Lawyers Guild in that year.         Her marriage to Frederick Kaufman ended in divorce. Her second husband, Paul Albert, died last year.         Surviving are a son, Michael, of Beacon Falls, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Janice Albert of Rome and Marilyn Albert of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Genora Johnson Dollinger, who rallied support for the hard-fought strike that gave the United Auto Workers union its foothold at the General Motors Company in 1937, died on Wednesday at Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 and had lived in Los Angeles since 1966.         Mrs. Dollinger was 23 when she organized the Women's Auxiliary of the U.A.W. and the Women's Emergency Brigade to feed and shield 2,000 strikers occupying a crucial Fisher Body Division plant in Flint, Mich. The strike began on Christmas Eve 1936 and ended 44 days later with the company's recognition of the union as bargaining agent for its work force.         The strike crippled General Motors, and its settlement proved a stellar event for the whole labor movement because it gave new stature to unions representing industrial workers.         Mrs. Dollinger's first husband, Kermit Johnson, was the only member of a citywide strike committee actually employed at the Fisher plant chosen for the strike. When spirits flagged during the long confrontation, her resolve stiffened the will of the "sitdowners."         Her women's auxiliaries went house-to-house to calm worried mothers and wives and gain their support. They also collected cash and food for their soup kitchens. And she had her women's brigade, wielding clubs, marching up and down the iron main gate and barricade to put their bodies between Pinkerton agents and their men inside.         In an interview with Studs Terkel for his most recent book, "Coming of Age" (New Press, 1995), she recalled how she and four of her unarmed lieutenants once stalled the police.         "Beating an unarmed woman was a different story in those days," she said. "We looked up and here came the emergency brigade, the Red Berets. We called ourselves that because of our red berets, red arm bands with white letters: EB. They were carrying the American flag and singing 'Solidarity Forever' and 'Hold the Fort'."         She said she was blacklisted in Flint and moved to Detroit and a job at the Briggs Manufacturing Company, a Chrysler supplier. She became a leader in a militant unit of the U.A.W. and was dismissed and rehired after thousands of Briggs workers went on strike for her.         Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., she grew up in Flint and, by age 18, was a charter member of the Flint Socialist Party. The party later turned into a catalyst for the strikes, which were widely denounced as Communist inspired.         Mrs. Dollinger continued as a union organizer. She fell victim to a lead-pipe attack in a wave of anti-union violence that included the shootings of Walter and Victor Reuther, both veterans of the 1937 strike at G.M.         She was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Michigan Women's Historical Center in Lansing last year.         Besides her husband of 51 years, Sol Dollinger, Mrs. Dollinger is survived by their son, Ronald, also of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren. Her first marriage ended in divorce.       
         Shirley Silverman, the mother of Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died on Monday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 91.         Mrs. Silverman was born in Odessa, then part of Russia, and immigrated to the United States in 1917. Immigration officials shortened her last name from Banchikov to Bahn. In 1923 she married Morris Silverman, who died in 1949.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by two sons, Dr. Sidney Silverman of Boca Raton, Fla., and Stanley S. Sills of North Hills, L.I.; 10 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Clelia Benjamin Delafield, a philanthropist and founding president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, died on Tuesday in Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore. A former resident of New York City and Sarasota, Fla., she was 92 and had lived in Baltimore in recent years.         Mrs. Delafield became a member of the center's board in 1946 and remained a member of the Board of Overseers Emeriti at her death. Her family also donated its wooded estate in Riverdale, the Bronx, to Columbia University.         Mrs. Delafield is survived by two daughters, Clelia D. Carey and Cynthia Delafield, both of Baltimore; a son, Walter B., of New York City; two sisters, Mary B. Henderson of Hunter, N.Y., and Yolanda Jaeckel of Sarasota, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband of 49 years, Edward C. Delafield, a banker, died in 1976.       
         Ruth Smallberg, a retired administrator of the Hunter College Library, died on Tuesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Smallberg was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Hunter College, she worked there for nearly 30 years until she retired from her senior library post three years ago. She was also vice president of the Scholarship and Welfare Fund of the Alumni Association of Hunter College and a founding member of the Friends of the Hunter College Library.         She is survived by her husband, Seymour; two sons, Ralph, of Manhattan, and Victor, of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Lois Schmittlinger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher, the black honors graduate who needed a backhanded assist from the Supreme Court in 1948 to win admission to the University of Oklahoma law school, died on Wednesday at her home in Oklahoma City. She was 71  and had served for three years on the university's board of regents, the very body that had denied her admission on the basis of her race.         The cause of death was cancer, her daughter, Charlene Factory, said.         By the time Mrs. Fisher applied to the University of Oklahoma law school on  Jan. 14, 1946, the Supreme Court had long held that under the separate-but-equal doctrine, states that sponsored law schools for white students were required to  supply similar training for qualified black students.         Since Oklahoma had no law school for black students, it seemed obvious that the white law school would be required to admit the eminently qualified Mrs. Fisher. An honors graduate of Langston, a state-run black college, she had been  recruited by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to test the state's harsh segregation laws, which, among other things, imposed a fine on any teacher who taught a mixed-race class.         But Oklahoma argued that the state planned to open a black law school someday and kept Mrs. Fisher at bay for more than two years, until January 1948, when the Supreme Court rejected the state's arguments and ordered it to provide her with a legal education.         The court did not specifically order her admission to the university law school, and when Oklahoma tried to satisfy the court by instantly creating a black law school exclusively for Mrs. Fisher, the court turned down her follow-up appeal in February 1948. The court said her original petition had not  addressed the issue of whether the creation of a separate law school for black students would fulfill the state's obligations under the 14th Amendment.         Mrs. Fisher may not have won her immediate point before the Supreme Court, but the arguments raised by her lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, who had denounced the state action as a sham, had a powerful impact on the court as it picked its way  toward the landmark 1954 decision overturning the separate-but-equal doctrine.         And Mrs. Fisher's campaign, which had won wide backing from the state's college teachers and students, had changed the political climate in Oklahoma. With dozens of other black college graduates pressing for admission to Oklahoma  graduate schools, the state swiftly backed down.         Mrs. Fisher was admitted to the law school in June 1949, but under such harsh conditions that any of her fellow students who had not already rallied to her cause were soon won over. She was forced to sit in a raised chair apart from the other students, behind a sign reading "Colored." And she had to use a side door  to the cafeteria and sit at a table separated by a chain from the rest of the room; a uniformed guard was posted to prevent interracial mingling.         But when the guard was not there, Mrs. Fisher later recalled, white students  would climb under the chain to encourage her. "They said, 'Come on, Ada, we've been waiting for you.' "         After Mrs. Fisher graduated in 1951, she worked for a while as a lawyer. She  returned to the university to earn a master's degree in history in 1968, and she joined the faculty at Langston University.         When she was appointed to the seven-member board of regents in April 1992, Mrs. Fisher said she had come full circle.         Mrs. Fisher's survivors all live in Oklahoma City; her husband, Warren, died  several years ago. In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, Bruce; a sister, Helen Huggins; four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Linda Goodman, whose down-to-earth insights into character traits were credited with bringing astrology out of the occult section and onto the best-seller lists with the 1968 publication of "Sun Signs," died on Saturday at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. She was about 70 and lived in Cripple Creek.         The hospital said the cause was complications of diabetes.         It may have been "the dawning of the age of Aquarius," as the 1960's song put it, but until Mrs. Goodman, a one-time newspaper reporter and sometime radio writer who had picked up an interest in astrology from grocery store booklets, sat down at her typewriter, the rays had not caused a blink in the publishing industry.         Within months after an obscure house named Taplinger brought out "Sun Signs," in 1968, it had become the first book on astrology to make The New York Times Best-Seller List.         Since then, her agent, Arthur Klebanoff, said yesterday, "Sun Signs," and two follow-up volumes, "Love Signs," (1978) and "Star Signs," (1988) have sold more than 30 million copies in 15 languages and continue to sell some 200,000 copies a year.         The $2.3 million paid for the paperback rights to "Love Signs" set an industry record.         What set Mrs. Goodman's books apart was a combination of her sharp insights and her elegant, accessible style.         Writing in the first person and drawing on the lives of celebrities, historical figures and personal friends to illustrate her points, Mrs. Goodman sometimes seemed more psychologist than astrologer.         Whether your sweetheart's streak of, say, stubbornness, came from the stars or childhood experiences, Mrs. Goodman was a master in elaborating how it would play out against your own tendencies as a dreamer.         Mrs. Goodman, whose original name was Mary Alice Kemery, was born in Morgantown, W. Va., on a date she gave as April 19 in a year she would never disclose.         "I once asked my grandfather, and he wouldn't tell me either," her son Michael Goodman said yesterday. During an interview a few years ago, Mrs. Goodman was more forthcoming, putting her age "between 435 and 450."         The date made her a triple Aries, and Mrs. Goodman, a five-foot-or-so dynamo fit the astrological profile to a T. "She was pushy," her son said.         A writer since childhood, Mrs. Goodman worked as an itinerant newspaper reporter, radio writer and occasional broadcaster. After reading "Letters from Linda" on a radio program, her son said, she adopted the name Linda.         Mrs. Goodman, whose early marriage to William Snyder ended in divorce, began writing "Sun Signs" in New York after an announcing job that had been promised her second husband, Sam Goodman, fell through.         Although her astrology has been called textbook as opposed to mystical, Mrs. Goodman developed a distinct mystic streak. "Star Signs," for example, draws on both numerology and reincarnation.         And when the New York authorities ruled that her 18-year-old daughter, Sarah Snyder, had committed suicide in 1973, Mrs. Goodman, citing her daughter's astrological chart among other evidence, refused to believe that the body identified by her husband was Sarah's.         She later spent so much time trying to find her daughter that she was forever running out of money, at one point living for several months on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral.         In addition to her son Michael, who is a resident of Keaau, Hawaii, she is survived by another son, William Snyder of Colorado Springs; a daughter, Jill Goodman, of Manchester, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Viveca Lindfors, the tall, dark and square-shouldered Swedish actress whose towering presence made her a star in dozens of movies and plays, died yesterday  in Uppsala, Sweden. She was 74.         The cause was complications from rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter, Lena Tabori. The actress, who lived in Manhattan, had returned to her home city  in July to tour in the play "In Search of Strindberg," Ms. Tabori said.         Miss Lindfors, who played a scientist in the 1994 science-fiction film "Stargate," stars in the movie "Last Summer in the Hamptons," which opened last  week at the East Hampton Film Festival and is to open next month in New York City and Los Angeles.         The film is about one of Miss Lindfors' favorite activities: spending time with relatives in the Hamptons when not working on stage or before a camera, Ms. Tabori said.         Ms. Lindfors, whose full name was Elsa Viveca Torstensdotter Lindfors, trained at the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm for three years before starting to make films in 1940. Her father, Torsten, was a publisher of art books; her mother, Karen, a painter.         Miss Lindfors appeared in many plays in Sweden and was considered that country's leading film attraction before leaving in 1946 for the United States,  where her auburn hair and elegant features led more than one observer to proclaim her an actress of Garboesque beauty.         Her American screen debut was two years later in "Night Unto Night," with Ronald Reagan. The director was Don Siegel, who would become her third husband.         Her early starring roles in American movies included parts in "Adventures of  Don Juan" (1948), with Errol Flynn; "No Sad Songs for Me" (1950), with Margaret  Sullavan, and "Four in a Jeep" (1951), with Ralph Meeker, for which she won the  "Best Actress of the Year" International Film Award.         She won a Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for her 1962 performance in "No Exit" and the Special Award at the Venice Film Festival for the 1960 movie "Weddings and Babies."         Her 1955 Broadway debut in the title role of "Anastasia," a drama about a woman claiming to be the missing daughter of Czar Nicholas 2d, won her immediate acclaim from critics and an award from the Drama League.         One critic called her acting in that play "electrifying." In an interview, Miss Lindfors said she had brought her performance to a peak by torturing herself with memories of how she felt upon the death of her brother two years earlier, "so that I could find the feelings of Anastasia."         Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times, "As Anastasia, longing desperately for the consolation of reunion with a blood relative, Miss Lindfors  is all grace, softness and humility."         Miss Lindfors appeared in plays by Shakespeare, Brecht, Tennessee Williams and others. In 1966, she was a founder and artistic director of the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.         Her television appearances included parts in the series "The Defenders" and "The Nurses." She also had starring roles in televised productions of the Dostoyevesky novel "The Idiot" and the Thornton Wilder story "The Bridge of San  Luis Rey."         Among her other well-known films are "The Spinning Family" and "In Paradise," both made in Sweden before she came to the United States, and the American movies "To the Victor" (1948), "This Side of the Law" and "Dark City" (1950), "The Story of Ruth" (1960), "An Affair of the Skin" (1963), "Coming Apart" (1969), "The Way We Were" (1973), and two 1978 films, "Girlfriends" and "A Wedding."         In 1990, Miss Lindfors was attacked by a man who slashed her face with a razor as she walked in Greenwich Village. Her wounds required 28 stitches.         Miss Lindfors married and divorced four times. Her husbands were Henry Hasso, a Swedish cinematographer; Folke Rogard, a Swedish attorney; Mr. Siegel, the director, and George Tabori, a Hungarian writer, producer and director.         In addition to her daughter, whose father was Folke Rogard, she is survived by two sons, John Tabori of Washington, whose father was Henry Hasso, and Kristoffer Tabori of Los Angeles, whose father was Don Siegel, and four grandchildren.       
         Lillian Fuchs, a renowned violist, composer, teacher and keeper of musical tradition, died yesterday morning at the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         Lillian Fuchs Stein was "one of the best string players in America," Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times in 1962, and she went on to become one of the most respected string teachers in the world. She taught from 1962 to 1991 at the Manhattan School of Music, from 1964 to 1990 at the Aspen Music Festival and School, and from 1971 to 1993 at the Juilliard School, where she was an emeritus member of the faculty until her death.         Ms. Fuchs was born in 1903 in New York. She took up the piano at an early age, and she and her brother Joseph were taught violin by their father.         "I just developed quietly because nobody paid any attention to me even in my family," she told The Strad magazine in 1986. "They were always fussing over Joseph. I didn't mind at all. I was delighted to be left alone."         She studied violin with the noted Franz Kneisel at the New York Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, and graduated with highest honors in 1924.         Ms. Fuchs made her New York debut on the violin in 1926, but soon shifted her concentration to viola. She collaborated often in performance with her brother Joseph and her other brother, Harry, a cellist. She played in a number of chamber groups, notably the Perole String Quartet and the Musicians Guild, and appeared as a soloist with major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Casals Festival Orchestra.         Ms. Fuchs was the first violist to perform and record the six Bach suites written for solo cello. "The measure of an artist is the silence he or she can inspire," Ross Parmenter wrote in The Times in 1948 of her performance of the Sixth Suite. "The silence for her performance was so intense that someone rattling cellophane in the back of the hall was an irritation to almost the whole audience."         Ms. Fuchs was an important teacher of chamber performance as well as of the viola. Her first pupil, she said in the 1986 Strad article, was "this boy from the West Coast": Isaac Stern. She also taught Pinchas Zukerman, and encouraged him to play viola as well as violin.         As a composer, she won several awards during her student years, and later wrote mainly for the viola.         Ms. Fuchs's husband, Ludwig Stein, died in 1992. She is survived by her brother Joseph; her daughters, Barbara Stein Mallow, a cellist, of Leonia, N.J., and Carol Stein Amado, a violinist, of Merion, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Services are to be held on Sunday afternoon at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street, Manhattan.         Correction:  October 10, 1995, Tuesday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the violist and teacher Lillian Fuchs misstated the day of her death. She died on Thursday, not Friday.       
         Lillian Nassau, the doyenne of New York antiques dealers and one of the first in America to see a market in Art Nouveau and Art Deco, died early yesterday at her home in New York. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Nassau held forth in a forest of Tiffany lamps in her two shops, first on Third Avenue and 56th Street and, from 1968 until her retirement in 1982, on East 57th Street. For more than 35 years, her galleries were gathering places for collectors and museum curators from around the world.         They came seeking the 20th-century decorative arts she stocked and the expertise she provided, both on the market and on the history of these objects. She was the first to handle the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany, and became his greatest champion in the revival that began in the mid-1950's and continues today. She paid $176 for her first leaded bronze-and-glass lamp by Tiffany in 1956; before her death Tiffany lamps were selling for more than $1 million.         She was also among the first to stock the works of the giants of early 20th-century European design: Rene Lalique's jewelry and glassware, Georg Jensen's silver, Emile Galle's vases and lamps and the furniture of Josef Hoffmann, Louis Majorelle and Carlo Bugatti.         In the 1970's Mrs. Nassau's clients included Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Barbra Streisand, Andy Warhol, Warner Leroy, all the Beatles and members of Led Zeppelin and Blood Sweat and Tears. Edgar J. Kaufmann Jr., the architectural historian, started collecting Tiffany flower-form vases there in the 1950's. And David Geffen bought most of his Tiffany lamps there in the 1970's, selling them in 1984 at Christie's in New York for two to five times what he had paid. Sydney and Frances Lewis of Richmond, who were Mrs. Nassau's customers from the 1960's until she retired, donated most of their Tiffany, Art Nouveau and Art Deco objects to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond..         And after Mrs. Nassau retired, no dealer took her place as the dominant merchant in the field. She remained a recognized authority, often consulted by curators and collectors.         Retirement was difficult for her at first, said her son, Paul, who took over the shop. "She wanted to keep running the business from home," he said. "But she was always available to talk, and until a few years ago, when she became ill, always gave me good advice."         Lillian Brinberg was born in Warsaw. She arrived with her family in New York when she was 2 years old. She attended public schools and went to Columbia University for a few years, hoping to become a newspaper reporter. Instead, she was married in 1920 to Harry Nassau; they were divorced in the late 1930's.         Mrs. Nassau became a dealer in 20th-century decorative arts in 1945, opening the shop on Third Avenue at 56th Street, her first. By then, she had spent a decade in the antiques business, buying and selling gold and jewelry door to door on Long Island, during the Depression. She also worked in a furniture store in Manhattan where she learned about antiques.         She often recalled that as she came into the business, dealers were taking unpopular Tiffany lamps and knocking out the glass flowers and trees, to sell the metal for junk. By the mid-1950's, the revival in Tiffany glass had begun, and Mrs. Nassau was in the vanguard of dealers handling this material.         Among her donations to institutions was a Tiffany mosaic mural that adds a glow to the courtyard of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also gave the Metropolitan her favorite piece of jewelry, a glorious enameled necklace, made about 1900 by Lalique.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband Dr. Leo S. Palitz and a sister, Pauline Sorkin, all of New York; two grandchildren, and five great-grandsons.       
         Marie Callender, a California woman who started baking pies at home for a delicatessen and turned that into a chain of 146 restaurants and a frozen-entree business, died on Saturday at the Rossmoor Regency Residential Community here. She was 88.         The cause was cancer.         Mrs. Callender got into the food business by chance, answering a delicatessen's help-wanted ad, then making pies for the business at home. The shop owner later persuaded her to start her own baking business and sell him pies.         She, her husband and son set up shop in Long Beach in a rented Quonset hut and began selling pies in 1948. Her only child, Donald Callender, sold the company to Ramada Inn in 1986, when it had annual sales of $175 million. About three-fourths of the restaurants are in California.         Mrs. Callender's husband died in 1984. She is survived by her son and three grandchildren.       
         Frances Grant Bennett, wife of the late Senator Wallace F. Bennett and mother of Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, died on Friday in Salt Lake City. She was 96.         Mrs. Bennett was on the primary general board of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While in Washington, she was president of the Congressional Club, a group of Congressional wives.         Frances Bennett was born on Sept. 23, 1899, to Heber J. Grant, president of  the Mormon Church and Emily Wells Grant in Salt Lake City.         She graduated from the University of Utah, and also attended Radcliffe College in Boston. In 1922, she married Wallace Bennett, who served four terms in the United States Senate and retired in 1974. He died in 1993.         Mrs. Bennett is survived by five children, 29 grandchildren and 74 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Beame, the wife of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, died on Tuesday at the New York Medical Center. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Beame was married to the former New York Mayor, who served from 1974 to  1978, for almost 68 years. The two met as teen-agers at the University Settlement House, which provided social services for poor Lower East Side residents.         They married in 1928, and Mr. and Mrs. Beame lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, for more than four decades, until he became Mayor.         Active in charities, she formed the Jennie Levine Cancer League in memory of  a friend who had died of cancer. She was named Woman of the Year in 1973 by the  National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Edmond, of Hamilton, Ontario, and Bernard, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Johnnie Tillmon Blackston, who encountered one officious welfare inspector too many and used her anger to help change the system, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 69.         Her family said the cause was diabetes.         Mrs. Blackston turned her rage over the indignities of a belittling system into a grass-roots movement that won widespread changes and helped make the plight of welfare mothers a feminist issue. And if she did nothing else, she proved that a single mother on welfare can be a woman to be reckoned with.         A sharecropper's daughter who was born in Scott, Ark., and never made it through high school, Mrs. Blackston was accustomed to running her own life. When things went bad in Arkansas, for example, she packed up her children, left her first husband behind and struck out for California in search of a better life.         Mrs. Blackston, who worked in a Los Angeles laundry to support her six children, was not prepared for what she had to endure when she eventually went on welfare, and the system was not prepared for her.         It was the early 1960's, a time, she soon found, when welfare inspectors routinely poked through recipients' refrigerators, demanded to know where they had got the money to buy television sets and staged midnight raids to make sure  they were not harboring men, a violation of the rules for women receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children.         When Mrs. Blackston, who had been a union shop steward, took offense at such  invasions of privacy, she sat down and sent anonymous letters to her neighbors at a Watts housing project, asking those on welfare to come to a protest meeting. More than 300 people showed up.         Within months in 1963, Mrs. Blackston and her friends founded Aid to Needy Children-Mothers Anonymous, linked up with other state groups and inspired the creation of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Over the next several years it successfully campaigned for improvements, removing many of the system's paternalistic trappings and establishing welfare as an enforceable right.         Along the way, Mrs. Blackston not only shaped the national welfare debate, but also changed the very terms of the argument, transforming what had been a concern far down the agenda of the civil rights movement into a compelling feminist issue.         Noting that the vast majority of welfare recipients were women and children and likening welfare to a "supersexist marriage," Mrs. Blackston was unsparing in her analysis in addresses to welfare mothers. As she once put it:         "You trade in 'a' man for 'The' Man. But you can't divorce him if he treats you bad. He can divorce you, of course -- cut you off -- any time he wants. But  in that case, 'he' keeps the kids, not you.         " 'The' Man runs everything. In ordinary marriage, sex is supposed to be for  your husband. On A.F.D.C. you're not supposed to have sex at all. You give up control of your body. It's a condition of aid. 'The' Man, the welfare system, controls your money. 'He' tells you what to buy and what not to buy, where to buy it and what things cost."         After serving as the national organization's executive director until a lack  of money forced it to close the Washington office in 1974, Mrs. Blackston returned to California, where she worked as a legislative aid and served on state and local committees concerned with welfare.         She is survived by her second husband, Harvey Blackston; six children, Marcia Evans of Riverside, Calif., Ronald, Auluavance, Josalyn and Tanya Tillmon of Los Angeles, and Caffie Tillmon of Stockton, Calif.; 20 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Greenberg, a one-time New Jersey housewife who parlayed an unlikely  hit record by a teen-age group known as the Shirelles into an improbable career  as the proprietor of a leading independent label of the 1960's, died on Thursday at the Hackensack University Medical Center. She was 82, and lived in Teaneck, N.J.         As a pioneering woman in the male-dominated world of rhythm-and-blues, Mrs. Greenberg was, by her own later account, a triple anomaly: "a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune."         Maybe so, but she had a finely tuned ear for popular music, a keen eye for talent and a driving ambition, all of which became increasingly apparent in the  1960's.         In addition to a series of hits by the Shirelles, among them "Dedicated to the One I Love," "Tonight's the Night," and Mrs. Greenberg's own composition, "Soldier Boy," her Scepter label produced such 1960's standards as "Louie, Louie," by the Kingsmen; "Twist and Shout," by the Isley Brothers, and "Walk on  By," by Dionne Warwick, not to mention "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," the  Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, sung by B. J. Thomas on the soundtrack of "Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which won an Academy Award in 1969.         Mrs. Greenberg traced her success to a day in 1957 when her 16-year-old daughter, Mary Jane, came home raving about the performance of four classmates at a Passaic High School assembly.         Their names were Shirley Alston, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner and Beverly Lee,  but they called themselves the Shirelles, and as soon as Mrs. Greenberg persuaded them to sing for her, she knew that their song, "I Met Him on a Sunday," had the makings of a hit.         A former Republican campaign worker who had translated her political skills into a job peddling songs for a local songwriters, Mrs. Greenberg, who had been  married to an accountant, had already become a familiar figure on Tin Pan Alley, hobnobbing with music-industry hopefuls at the old Turf restaurant on Broadway at 51st Street. She had also joined with two partners to form a label, Tiara Records.         The Tiara release of "I Met Him on a Sunday" was such an immediate success. Within months, Mrs.  Greenberg climbed so many radio-station stairs, sold so many records from the trunk of her car and created such demand that her company  could not handle the orders. So she sold the Shirelles' contract to Decca, an industry giant.         That might have been the end of her career, but, Decca, convinced that the Shirelles would be a one-hit phenomenon, returned the group to Mrs. Greenberg, who formed Scepter to replace Tiara.         Over the next decade, Scepter became an industry sensation as Mrs. Greenberg, whose company eventually occupied an entire floor of 1650 Broadway, repeatedly demonstrated her sure sense of talent.         This was never more evident than the day in 1962 when Mr. Bacharach played a  demonstration record of one of his songs for Mrs. Greenberg, and she told him that while she did not like the song she loved the singer.         The next day, Mr. Bacharach returned, saying he had a signed contract with the singer, a young woman named Dionne Warwick.         Partly because of the long line of hit Warwick releases that followed, Gulf & Western offered $6 million for Scepter in 1965, but Mrs. Greenberg declined to sell.         It was, she later said, a major mistake. Within a decade, as major labels came to dominate the distribution network, Scepter's success had faded, and by the time the company folded in 1977 Mrs. Greenberg had lost everything.         In recent years, Mrs. Greenberg had been cheered by Bette Midler's plans to make a movie of her life, but because Ms. Midler has been unable to secure the required rights from two of the three surviving Shirelles (Ms. Harris died in 1982), the project is dormant.         She is survived by her daughter, Mary Jane Goff of Upper Saddle River, N.J.;  a son, Stanley, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Ethel T. Chamberlain, who dedicated her life to the Salvation Army and served as national president of its women's organizations from 1974 to 1977, died on Wednesday at a Salvation Army retirement home in Asbury Park, N.J. She was 86.         From the time she attended an open air meeting as a 9-year-old in Malone, N.Y., Mrs. Chamberlain was devoted to the Salvation Army and its principles of service to others. She entered its training school in the Bronx at the age of 17 and spent her entire career with the religious and philanthropic organization.         An inspirational speaker who filled church pews in the 1950's, 60's, and 70's, starting in a time when women were rarely allowed at church pulpits, Mrs.  Chamberlain encouraged women to transcend sexual stereotypes. She served on the  National Board of Directors of Church Women United and was the keynote speaker at the first "International Year of the Woman" Conference in Mexico City in 1975.         Mrs. Chamberlain also organized and directed the Salvation Army's service program during World War II. Among her other jobs for the organization, she was  president of its women's organizations in the West Indies and Caribbean Territory and territorial president of its Women's Services in the southern states and Mexico.         Her husband, William E. Chamberlain, was the Salvation Army's national president.         Mrs. Chamberlain is survived by four daughters, Alice Baxendale of Clearwater, Fla., Jean C. Mosher of DeWitt, N.Y., Roberta C. Schofield of Cazenovia, N.Y., and Carol Appleby of Columbia, S.C.; 10 grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren, and two sisters, Helen Covell of Tucson, Ariz., and Erma Mowers of Syracuse, N.Y.

         Judith Lane Rand, a novelist who also worked in radio and advertising, died on Nov. 21 at her home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. She was 64.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Rand wrote daily radio shows for James Beard, Arlene Francis, Dorothy and Mary Rodgers and Dione Lucas, among others. She also contributed articles to New York magazine and was the author of several novels, including "Fevered Sands." One of her books, "Paper Castles," was the basis of a 1984 CBS movie, "He's Fired, She's Hired." With her husband, John, she wrote and produced "Quick Changes," a satirical revue that had a successful run in Chicago. She also wrote two award-winning industrial films.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Eliza Damiecki  of Bridgehampton, L.I., and Hilary Adams of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Minnie Lee Langley, an early and persistent leader in the effort to have the  State of Florida compensate survivors of a white mob's rampage in the black settlement of Rosewood, Fla., in 1923, died on Saturday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 83 and lived in Jacksonville.         She had cancer surgery earlier in the week, her family said.         Mrs. Langley was one of the few remaining witnesses to one of the worst episodes of racial violence in Florida history. A white mob, looking for a black man accused of assaulting a white woman, was responsible for a week of burning and shooting that left at least six Rosewood residents dead and the hamlet in ruins. Two white men were also killed.         Mrs. Langley and eight other survivors received some satisfaction last year when Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, signed a bill recognizing the depravity of  the event and authorizing $150,000 in compensation for each of them. She was the lead witness in the legislative hearings, providing vivid testimony about the destruction of Rosewood. In the end, the state acknowledged that the authorities, from Gov. Cary Hardee on down, had failed to protect the hamlet's residents.         Mrs. Langley was one of several children staying in an uncle's home when the  mob closed in on a January night. They escaped through a rear door and hid shivering in the woods for several days. The mob never found the man it was looking for, and doubt remains whether any white woman had been attacked.         After moving to Jacksonville in 1926, Mrs. Langley made a living making brooms and brushes.         She is survived by a son, Anthony H. and a daughter, Dorothy Smith, both of Jacksonville; 10 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Alexina Duchamp, the widow of Marcel Duchamp, died on Wednesday at her home in Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris. She was 89.         As a former daughter-in-law of Henri Matisse, the widow of Duchamp and a close friend of John Cage and Jasper Johns, she was in her later years the unquestioned doyenne of the survivors of a great age in art, dance and music.         She had close ties to Philadelphia and took pride in being an honorary trustee of its Museum of Art, which has by far the largest collection of Duchamp's work. She was delighted when in 1967 his last major work, the scenographic "Etant Donnes," or "Given," was installed there.         "Etant Donnes" had been built in secret in New York between 1964 and 1966, a  time when Duchamp was believed to have stopped working forever. During much of its construction, Mrs. Duchamp was her husband's sole confidante.         Alexina Sattler was born in Cincinnati on Jan. 6, 1906, the daughter of Dr. Robert Sattler, an ophthalmologist who ran his own hospital with a free clinic attached, and his second wife, the former Agnes Mitchell.         She at first thought of becoming an artist and for a time studied sculpture with Brancusi in Paris. In December 1929 she married the son of Henri Matisse, Pierre, who was to become a distinguished art dealer on Madison Avenue. When her husband was mobilized in Paris at the outbreak of World War II, she ran the gallery for some months.         After a divorce from Pierre Matisse in 1949, she married Duchamp in 1954. They lived in New York, in Paris and in the summer in Cadaques in northern Spain. After Duchamp's death in 1968, she became close to the composer Cage and  to a new circle of friends.         She is survived by the three children of her marriage to Matisse, Jacqueline, Paul and Peter, and by 12 grandchildren.       
         Lillian Teit Zabar, who fled the pogroms of her homeland, came to the United  States and became part of an American success story, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 90, or perhaps 92 or 93.         Mrs. Zabar was a founder with her husband, Louis, of Zabar's gourmet delicatessen and food emporium on Broadway at 80th Street in Manhattan. The business was started in 1934 and now has about 35,000 customers a week and $40 million in sales a year, her sons Stanley and Saul said last night.         Mrs. Zabar marked her 90th birthday on the day she died, but her sons said she was almost certainly two or three years older. When she came to the United States from Ukraine in the mid-1920's, she shaved some years off her age out of  fear that the immigration authorities would send her back as too old, her sons said.         Nor was it known with certainty that Dec. 22 was her date of birth. But she knew she was born during Hanukkah, so her birthday was celebrated during the holiday every year, her sons explained.         His mother's life was "the classic American success story," Saul Zabar said last night.         She came to America alone and settled first with relatives in Philadelphia. Later, she moved to New York City, where she met Louis Zabar, an old acquaintance from their Ukrainian village. They soon married.         Mr. Zabar headed the smoked-fish section of a food store, and Mrs. Zabar was  an accomplished cook. They started their modest deli in Brooklyn and moved it to Manhattan a half-century ago.         Saul and Stanley Zabar, who live in Manhattan and are still associated with the business founded by their parents, said last night that their mother was a gifted maker of blintzes, potato salad, stuffed cabbage and coleslaw. Besides which, they said, she kept house and raised three sons.         Louis Zabar died in 1950. Mrs. Zabar's second husband, Louis Chartoff, died about 15 years ago. Surviving are another son, Eli, a Manhattan restaurateur; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

         Connie Boucher, a pioneer in licensing cartoon characters who provided the inspiration for "Happiness Is a Warm Puppy," a best-selling 1962 book about Snoopy, the "Peanuts" comic strip character, died on Dec. 20 in San Francisco of complications after heart surgery. She was 72.         Ms. Boucher was a window dresser for I. Magnin, a San Francisco Bay area women's clothier, in 1959 when she grew dissatisfied with the quality of coloring books available for her two sons. With her husband, Jim Young, she created a Winnie-the-Pooh coloring book, using a character that was in the public domain. The book sold 50,000 copies.         Two years later, she founded Determined Productions Inc. to develop other products based on licensing characters. One of her first efforts was a calendar  using the characters in the "Peanuts" comic strip.         "What made her different was the quality and originality of her ideas," Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist, said yesterday. "She proposed the date book in 1961, and now everyone is doing them. After that, she started doing sweatshirts and banners and all that. She kind of set a standard for licensing,  which up until she came along had not always been that high."         Mr. Schulz said that the second year's calendar sold twice as well and that they began discussing his desire to publish books using Charlie Brown and other  characters. Until then, he said, publishers had been interested only in reprints of his comic strips.         "She had seen the strip I had drawn where Snoopy is being hugged by Charlie Brown and Charlie Brown says, 'Happiness is a warm puppy,' " Mr. Schulz said. "Connie said that maybe this could become a good book, and I said I didn't know  if I could think of any more of those ideas. That day, after she left, I wrote virtually all the ideas in 'Happiness Is a Warm Puppy' and it was the best-selling book the next year."         The book spent 45 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, reaching No.  2.         Five years ago, Ms. Boucher's company helped underwrite a show at the Louvre  in Paris celebrating 40 years of Snoopy.         In recent years, Ms. Boucher turned her attention to conservation issues. She helped arrange product licensing to benefit the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations. She was also nominated for an Academy Award for producing "Amazon Diary," a short live-action film, a spokeswoman for her company, Jaymi Horn, said.         In addition to her husband and business partner, Ms. Boucher is survived by a sister, June Dutton of Sausalito, Calif; two sons, Douglas, of Belvedere, Calif., and Theodore, of Davis, Calif., and five grandchildren.       
         Gretchen Geber, a cello instructor whose students have gone on to play in major American orchestras, died on Saturday at her home in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 81.         Mrs. Geber studied briefly at the University of Southern California and later taught there while pursuing studio work and performing.         Among her students are current members of symphonies in Los Angeles and New  Orleans, said her husband, Edwin, a retired cellist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Geber is survived by two sons, Stephen, the  principal cellist with the Cleveland Orchestra, and David, a cellist with the American String Quartet and chairman of the Manhattan School of Music's string department, and six grandchildren.       
         Helen Hill Miller, a prolific biographer and journalist, died on Tuesday at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. She was 96, and had homes in Washington and Kitty Hawk, N.C.         Mrs. Miller wrote more than 20 books. Her biographies included "George Mason: Constitutionalist" (1938), "Captains From Devon: The Great Elizabethan Seafarers Who Won the World for England" and "Colonel Parke of Virginia: The Greatest Hector in Town" (1990). She also wrote six books on Greece and several works on  foreign policy.         Mrs. Miller was born in Highland Park, Ill. She received a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1921, a diploma in economics from Oxford University in 1922 and a doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago in 1928.         After working as a staff writer for the Agriculture Department in the late 1930's, she became a Washington correspondent for The Economist and Newsweek from 1940 to 1952. From 1958 to 1966, she was a contributing editor of The New Republic. She also contributed to Harper's Magazine and Esquire.         At the time of her death she had just completed a memoir, "Washington Observed."         She is survived by two sons, Andrew, of Washington, and Robert, of Elizabethtown, N.C., and nine grandchildren.       
         Lita Grey Chaplin, an actress and Charlie Chaplin's second wife, died today at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital here. She was 88.         Mrs. Chaplin, whose original name was Lillita Louise MacMurray, changed her name to Lita Grey while trying to break into films as a teen-ager. She worked for Chaplin at his Hollywood studio when she was 12. She was 16 when she married him in 1924; Chaplin was 35 and near the height of his fame. Their three-year marriage produced two sons, Sydney and the late Charles Jr.         Mrs. Chaplin played clubs in Europe and the United States and spent eight years with the Radio Keith Orpheum theater circuit before retiring from show business in 1947. In 1965 she wrote "My Life With Chaplin."         Chaplin was married to Mildred Harris in 1918, to Paulette Goddard in 1933 and to Oona O'Neill in 1943. He died in 1977.         In addition to her son, Sydney, she is survived by two grandchildren and one  great-grandchild.       
         Eleanor Brown Gambee, a horticulturist, writer and civic worker, died on Saturday at her home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.

         Mildred Lahr, who was married to the comedian Bert Lahr from 1940 until his death in 1967, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         Mrs. Lahr, whose maiden name was Schroeder, was born in Cincinnati and came to New York in 1928 after winning a beauty contest. She became a Ziegfeld Girl and made her Broadway debut in 1930 in Earl Carroll's "Fine and Dandy." She made occasional appearances in sketches with Mr. Lahr after their marriage, but he did not encourage her acting ambitions.         She is survived by a daughter, Jane, of New York City; a son, John, an author and a drama critic for The New Yorker, of London, and two grandchildren.       
         Felicia Geffen, a former executive director of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, died on Dec. 21 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         She had been suffering from leukemia and osteoporosis, said her daughter, Eloise B. Segal.         Miss Geffen was born in New York City on Feb. 16, 1903. She was a graduate of Hunter College and studied music before becoming an administrative assistant to the conductor and composer Walter Damrosch, whom she succeeded as director of the academy in 1941.

In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Valerie Cossart, an actress who appeared in many Broadway and Off Broadway productions in the 1930's and 40's, died on Dec. 31 at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was pneumonia, said her stepdaughter, Valerie Livingston Hopkins.         Valerie Cossart Livingston was born in London, the daughter of a well-known British actor, Ernest Cossart. She made her theatrical debut as a child, in a production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in which her father played the role of Bottom.

         Libby E. Sachar, who in 1946 was the first woman appointed a Superior Court judge in New Jersey, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 90.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her son, Judge Leonard Sachar of Scotch Plains, N.J.         Selected as a juvenile-domestic relations judge by Gov. Walter Edge and reappointed in 1951, she served in Union County for 10 years until she resumed her private law practice in Plainfield.

         Dr. Barbara Jelavich, a prominent scholar of Eastern European history with a particular interest in the Balkan countries, died on Saturday at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 71 and lived in Bloomington.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Indiana University.         She was on the faculty of Indiana University from 1961 until she retired as distinguished professor emeritus of history in 1993. During that time, she was the author or co-author of 17 books about Russia, the Balkans, and the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires. Some were written with her husband, Charles, also a professor emeritus of history at Indiana.         Her areas of expertise included Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Yugoslavia.         Born Barbara Brightfield in Belleville, Ill., she grew up in Berkeley, Calif. She received three degrees in history from the University of California at Berkeley, including, in 1948, a Ph.D. She started her academic career at Berkeley as a junior research historian at the Institute of Slavic Studies and a lecturer in history.         She joined the Indiana faculty as a lecturer in 1961 and by 1967 was a full professor in the history department.         Among her works currently in print are "History of the Balkans: 18th and 19th Centuries" (Cambridge University Press, 1983); "History of the Balkans: 20th Century" (Cambridge, 1983); "Russia and the Formation of the Romanian Empire" (Cambridge, 1984); "Modern Austria: Empire and Republic" (Cambridge, 1987); "Russia and the Rumanian National Cause" (Archon reprint, 1974), and "Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806-1914" (Cambridge, 1991).         Besides her husband, survivors include two sons, Mark, of Maryville, Mo., and Peter, of Austin, Tex., and two grandchildren.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         "Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities. Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives. Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please." An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities.         Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives.  Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please."         An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.

And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."         Correction:  March 17, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Jan. 23 of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy misstated both the name and the location of the school from which she graduated in 1910. At that time, it was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart, not Manhattanville College, and it was located in Manhattanville, N.Y., not Purchase. A recent letter from a reader pointed out the error.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's church, children and grandchildren today celebrated the enduring Catholic faith of the founding mother of a political dynasty at funeral services in the church where she was baptized 104 years ago.         Her last living son, Edward M. Kennedy, eulogized the mother of a President, two Senators and an Ambassador and the grandmother of two United States Representatives and the Lieutenant Governor and a state representative in Maryland, saying, "She was ambitious not only for our success, but for our souls."         "She sustained us in the saddest times -- by her faith in God, which was the greatest gift she gave us -- and by the strength of her character, which was a combination of the sweetest gentleness and the most tempered steel," he said.         Bernard Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston, celebrated the Mass of Resurrection at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church and said, "Surely, as she herself expressed it, her greatest gift was the gift of faith."         "She treasured it beyond all others," he continued, "and we honor that gift in her as we bring her here to this church."         The Cardinal read a letter of condolence from President Clinton and an apostolic blessing from Pope John Paul II, and called Mrs. Kennedy "a woman of great strength and deep faith, who is unequaled in the way her life was at the service of the commonweal."         "Few lives," he said, "have been so intertwined with the joys and sorrows of our nation's life as have hers."         Mrs. Kennedy, whose sons John and Robert were assassinated, whose son Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in a wartime plane explosion, and whose daughter Kathleen was killed in a plane crash, was quoted by her grandson Edward M. Kennedy Jr. as saying in her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974):         "The most important element in human life is faith. If God were to take away all His blessings, health, physical fitness, wealth, intelligence and leave me with but one gift, I would ask for faith -- for with faith in Him and His Goodness, mercy and love for me, and belief in everlasting life, I believe I could suffer the loss of my other gifts and still be happy."         Along with personal friends of Mrs. Kennedy and her children, the congregation of more than 700 included Tipper Gore, the wife of the Vice President, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston and Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, all Democrats. The two most prominent Republicans were Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who has preceded Senator Kennedy in one Senate chairmanship and followed him in another, and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.         One absentee who was frequently recalled was Mrs. Kennedy's oldest living daughter, Rosemary, who resides in an institution for the mentally retarded in Wisconsin. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the next oldest, said, "Mother's intelligence was always informed and directed by the strength and compassion of the heart," exemplified when "she never forgot or let us ignore the company of our sister, Rosemary." Mrs. Shriver told of Rosemary's going with her on her first trip to Europe and of their forging a friendship that became the basis of her work for the disabled and the mentally retarded.         The grandmother's determined jaw was recognizable on many of the dozens of descendants who attended. The service was occasionally punctuated by cries from the youngest of her great-grandchildren who were here.         Mrs. Kennedy's 104 years amounted to just more than half the history of the Republic, and Senator Kennedy said she "was born in 1890, the year of the Battle of Wounded Knee, when Benjamin Harrison was in the White House."         "And she never let us forget that she had lived so much of the history that we only read about," he said.         Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald was baptized in St. Stephen's Church on July 23, 1890, just a day after her birth. She graduated from Dorchester High School and received her diploma in 1906 from her father the Mayor, John F. Fitzgerald, who was known as Honey Fitz. She was courted and wed in 1914 by an ambitious banker, Joseph P. Kennedy.         Both Senator Kennedy and Mrs. Shriver called their mother "our greatest teacher." Mrs. Shriver told of geography quizzes and bedtime stories, and said, "She taught us to listen to Dad's dinner table conversations about politics, which seemed too boring to a small child but later became the basis for our life's work."         This morning Massachusetts drivers stopped in the cold at highway overpasses to watch the motorcade bring her body from her home at Hyannis Port. This afternoon, after the church service, she was buried next to her husband, who died in 1969, in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.       
         Hilda Cole Espy, an author who wrote about her adventures in rearing five children after an early career as a publicity agent for Kate Smith and Fred Waring, died on Friday at the Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pa. She was 83 and lived in Delaware Water Gap, Pa.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter Freddy Espy Plimpton.         Before her marriage to the writer Willard R. Espy in 1940, Mrs. Espy was a publicity agent and an editor of Woman's Day, in addition to writing for several magazines.         The books she wrote about her family were "Quiet Yelled Mrs. Rabbit" (1959) and "Look Both Ways" (1962). She also wrote, with Lex Creamer Jr., the travel book "Another World: Central America" (1970).         Her marriage to Mr. Espy ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Plimpton, of Sagaponack, L.I., she is survived by three other daughters, Joanna, of Manhattan, Mona Espy Schreiber of New Orleans and Cassin Espy-Speziali of Staten Island, six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said.         Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.         She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.         Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."         When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.         The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."         Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."         Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.         In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.         Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.         Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.         Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Lucy D. Manoff, for four decades a leader in cultural and educational institutions in Israel, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 81.         She died of complications of pulmonary and heart disease, said her son Robert K. Manoff of Pound Ridge, N.Y.         Among the institutions in which she held leadership posts were the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Vidal Sassoon Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism of the Hebrew University and the Committee on Manpower Opportunities in Israel. The latter group recruited American volunteer doctors to serve with the Israeli forces during the Six-Day War of 1967.         For more than 30 years, Mrs. Manoff was the American executive director for the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The institute was organized to study American historical ties to Israel and the contemporary Jewish experience worldwide.         Mrs. Manoff played a prominent role in developing curriculums for Jewish studies in American colleges and universities.         An early feminist, she was a founding member of the board of the Women's Campaign Fund, organized to promote the election of women to public office.         Mrs. Manoff was born in New York City and graduated from Hunter College.         She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Richard K. Manoff; another son, Dr. Gregory P. Manoff of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Martha Deutscher of New York, and six grandchildren.       
         Irene S. Forrest, a biochemist who helped develop tests to trace whether psychiatric patients were taking their medication, died on Dec. 22 in her home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 86.         The cause was complications from diabetes, said her daughter, Joan H. Armer of Menlo Park.         Together with her late husband, Fred M. Forrest, a psychiatrist, Dr. Forrest developed urine tests to detect drugs in the body, phenothiazines, used in the treatment of schizophrenia. The tests, called Forrest tests, also allow doctors to determine the amount of drugs taken and how they worked in the body.         Psychiatric patients are often reluctant to take drugs, doctors say, because it is a tacit admission that they are ill.         Born in Berlin, Dr. Forrest received her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, where she studied under her father, Carl Neuberg, the director. From 1932 to 1936, she worked at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and at Istanbul University before emigrating to the United States.         After World War II she was reunited with her father and worked with him at New York University, the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn and the New York Medical College until his death in 1956. In 1957, she joined the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brockton, Mass., to do research in psychopharmacology.         Dr. Forrest transferred to the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1961. While there she also held research positions at either Stanford University or the University of San Francisco until her retirement in 1978.         Over her career, she had more more than 100 papers published.         In addition to her daughter, Dr. Forrest is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Blanche G. Etra, a lawyer and philanthropist who played an important role in the development of Yeshiva University, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was leukemia, said a son, Donald, of Los Angeles.         The Etra family had long supported Yeshiva. Mrs. Etra expanded that role by helping to found, in 1953, the National Women's Division of Yeshiva's newly chartered Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She was its first president and became honorary president in 1962.         When the university founded the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in the mid-1970's, she was named to its Board of Directors and served as secretary from 1986 until her death. She also was the first woman to serve on the medical college's Board of Overseers.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Etra graduated from Barnard College in 1935. In 1938, she received a law degree from Columbia University and began a private practice. After the death of her husband of 38 years, Harry, in 1977, she joined the law firm of Etra & Etra, where her partner was her brother-in-law, Max Etra, chairman of Yeshiva's board from 1953 to 1977.         Mrs. Etra was on the national Board of Directors for the United Jewish Appeal and served as a director of Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa., and the Brookdale Center of Hunter College.         Besides Donald, she is survived by two other sons, Aaron and Marshall, both of Manhattan; a sister, Helen Rachmil of Los Angeles; a brother, Morton Goldman of Manhattan, and six grandchildren. A fourth son, Jonathan, died in 1991.       
         Nora Dunfee, an actress who taught for many years in the graduate acting program of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, died on Dec. 23 at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was complications after a brief illness, the university's press office reported in a statement.         Ms. Dunfee was born in Belmont, Ohio. She began her professional acting career at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Me. Her stage credits included "Madam, Will You Walk?" (1953), "The Midnight Caller" (1958), "The Visit" (1960), "The Last Days of Lincoln" (1961) and "Crowbar" (1990).         She also taught privately in New York and California and coached many actors over the years, including Julie Haydon, James Earl Jones, Raul Julia, Diane Keaton, Mel Gibson and Keanu Reeves. In theater, she was a vocal consultant for "The Real Thing," "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Lie of the Mind."         Ms. Dunfee also appeared in films, including "Lorenzo's Oil." Most recently, she was seen in "Forrest Gump," as the Southern Lady who sympathetically advises Tom Hanks at a bus stop.         Ms. Dunfee met her future husband, David Clarke, in an acting class. The couple appeared together in a number of stage productions, including "Portrait of a Lady," "The Visit" and "The Gin Game."         She is survived by her husband; two daughters, K. C. Ligon of New York City and Susan Bennett of Seattle, and two grandchildren.       
         Sylvia Bernstein Seaman, a writer and one of the last active members of the suffragist movement, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said. She published a book about that disease 30 years ago, "Always a Woman: What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer," the first by someone outside the medical profession. "It was considered daring at the time," she later said, "but it changed attitudes, I think."         She became a confirmed suffragist in high school and first marched for the right to vote as a student in 1915. While in college, she took part in the parades of August 1920 celebrating the 19th Amendment that secured women's suffrage nationwide.         In 1970, she was one of five veterans of 1920 chosen to lead the 50th anniversary parade on Fifth Avenue.         She was in the lead again in a 1980 march marking the 60th anniversary of victory. She made her final public appearance last August with an address on feminism and women in American history when the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women marked the 74th anniversary.         Sylvia Bernstein was born in Manhattan and graduated from Cornell University. She taught high school English in New York City before turning to writing.         With her Cornell roommate, Frances Schwartz, she wrote novels under the name Francis Sylvin. They chose a male pseudonym because they thought that female authors were not taken seriously.         In one novel, "Miracle Father" (1952), a couple produced a child by artificial insemination. It was republished in 1968 as "Test-Tube Father."         Mrs. Seaman underwent a radical mastectomy in 1955, an experience that led her to write "Always a Woman," published in 1965. It was a rarely discussed topic, which she also wrote about for magazines and newspapers.         In the 1970's, she resumed writing travel pieces and humor, including her last book, "How to Be a Jewish Grandmother" (1979). Travel was her avocation, and she visited more than 100 countries.         Her personal and professional papers are in the collection of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Radcliffe College.         She is survived by her husband of 69 years, William Seaman; two sons, Gideon, of Manhattan and Jonathan, of Brooklyn, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Cecil H. Roy, who supplied the voices for innumerable radio and animated film characters, died on Jan. 26 at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. She was 94 and lived at the Actors' Extended Care Facility in Englewood.         Ms. Roy was born in St. Paul and reared in Oklahoma. She began her acting career with a stock company in Chicago, but soon turned to radio work, where her vocal versatility quickly made her known as "The Girl of a Thousand Voices." Able to imitate anyone from a crying baby to a cranky octogenarian, she frequently performed more than a score of character roles during a single hourlong radio program.         Later in her career, she was the voice behind a number of animated film characters, among them Little Lulu and Caspar the Friendly Ghost. She also made recordings for children, including a portrayal of Winnie the Pooh on a recording with Jimmy Stewart. Among her many radio credits were "Ma Perkins," "The Rise of the Goldbergs," "The Henry Aldrich Show" and "Pepper Young's Family."         She is survived by a son, Richard, of Montclair, N.J.; four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Millicent Hirsh Lang, a Bronx native who became a top-ranked women's tennis player in the 1930's and 1940's, died at a hospice in Boca Raton, Fla., on Friday. She was 78 and lived most of her life in Great Neck, L.I.         She died of a stroke, said her husband, Nathaniel Lang.         Mrs. Lang began playing tennis when she was 8 years old on public courts in the Bronx. She won her first public tournament at age 11. As a junior player, she captured three titles in the 1930's and at age 16 won the singles and doubles trophies at the United States Ladies Tennis Association National Indoors Tournament in 1933.         By the time she was 19, Mrs. Lang was a veteran on the women's tennis circuit. In the early 1940's, she was ranked 14th in United States women's singles and No. 1 in the Eastern states. In her later years, she played a prominent role in the Eastern Tennis Association.         She is survived by her husband; her daughters, Geraldine Jacobs of Woodstock, N.Y., Sarah Cleary of Warwick, N.Y., and Elizabeth Marino of Great Neck, and seven grandchildren.       
         Dr. Mary Dwight B. McNair Scott, a biochemistry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was a pioneer in the identification of the B complex of vitamins and their functions, died on Feb. 9 at the Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, where she lived. She was 87.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Thomas F. McNair Scott.         In 1935, while she was completing work at Harvard University for a doctorate in biochemistry, she became one of the first women appointed to the faculty of the Harvard Medical School as a research associate.         She married the following year and moved to England with her husband where she did research on the biochemistry of diabetes at the University College Medical School in London.         From 1943 to 1946, while on the faculty of Wellesley College, she conducted studies identifying N-methyl nicotinamide in urine which contributed to the discovery of the B complex vitamin, niacin.         After her husband completed his wartime service in England, the couple settled in Philadelphia, where she went to work for the University of Pennsylvania's Children's Hospital. From 1954 to 1965 she was in the School of Medicine's research medicine and physiology departments. In 1965 Dr. Scott moved to the School of Veterinary Medicine and retired in 1972.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Robert, of Bern, Switzerland; a daughter, Carolyn Hoehn of Heidelberg, Germany; a sister, Helen Sutton Gulick of Sacramento, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Ellen Sulzberger Straus, who was active in Call for Action and other nonprofit organizations and in the communications industry, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, R. Peter Straus.         At her death, Mrs. Straus was president of Executive Service Strategies, a management and consulting firm that she founded in 1986. She and Mr. Straus were for some years co-owners of WMCA, a Manhattan-based radio station, which they sold in 1986.         In 1963, Mrs. Straus founded Call for Action, the nation's first telephone help line, which was intended to aid individuals in solving their problems with officials, corporations and landlords. That activity, using office space at WMCA, became the prototype for similar organizations in nearly all major United States cities.         Mrs. Straus was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College in 1945. She worked as the executive secretary of the New York League of Women Voters and on the staff of the Atomic Energy Commission, becoming assistant director of public information. In 1949, she helped to manage Gov. Herbert H. Lehman's campaign for the United States Senate.         Later, based in Switzerland while Mr. Straus was an executive with the International Labor Organization, she worked as a Geneva correspondent for several upstate newspapers.         In addition to her husband of 45 years, who is chairman of Straus Communications, Mrs. Straus is survived by her mother, Louise Mayer Blumenthal Sulzberger of Longboat Key, Fla., and Saranac Lake, N.Y.; four children, Diane Tucker of Bedford, N.Y., Katherine Caple of Wellesley, Mass., Jeanne Tofel of Manhattan and Eric Straus of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; two sisters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann Sand, both of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Ida Gertrude Krebs, whose lifelong interest in children with learning disabilities led her to found a school where she could implement a highly individual approach to such problems, died on Feb. 11 at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. She was 86 and had lived in Lexington, Mass., until about three years ago.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Roy R. Krebs Jr. of Alexandria.         Born in Fort Worth, a grand-niece of President Woodrow Wilson, she first offered help to the disadvantaged when, as a teen-ager, she tutored a neighbor who had been dismissed from school because of a learning disability. In 1968, she founded the Krebs School in Lexington, Mass., where more than 100 children with learning disabilities studied in classes of no more than eight pupils.         She employed unusual techniques to capture the children's interest. The school's pet dog was brought to class so students would learn to count by monitoring the wags of its tail. Division was taught with visits to the kitchen to slice carrots.         She was a member of the President's Council on Handicapped Children for more than 20 years and worked as a consultant to Governments in Canada, Colombia and Venezuela.         Trained as a nurse, she counseled veterans returning from World War II who had suffered battle trauma. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education from Boston University, she tutored extensively in Cambridge, Mass., and then in Arlington, Mass., before establishing her own school.         Upon her retirement in 1986, the Krebs School was merged into the Cotting School, which offered a more comprehensive curriculum.         Her husband, Roy R. Krebs, died in the mid-1940's. In addition to her son, Roy Jr., she is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Quinlan of San Clemente, Calif., and Dr. Ruth Briles of Sycamore, Ill.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Catherine H. Sweeney, a patron of the sciences and arts for whom the Sweeney Mountains of Antarctica were named, died on Jan. 25 at the Miami Heart Institute. She was 80 and lived in Coconut Grove, Fla.         The cause was heart failure, said her son-in-law, Eric Fraunfelter.         Mrs. Sweeney called herself "just a lady gardener," but her efforts on behalf of botany, exploration, education and the arts earned her such honors as a silver medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society and an honorary doctorate from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., where she sent eight women from Sri Lanka to be educated at her expense.         She was also a trustee of the Congressionally chartered National Tropical Botanical Garden, the Fairchild Tropical Garden in Miami, the American Horticultural Society, the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation. She was a member-at-large of the Garden Club of America and a founder of the Florida chapter of the Society of Women Geographers.         Among other enterprises, Mrs. Sweeney rescued and restored the eight-acre estate called The Kampong in Coconut Grove in 1963. She donated the property, the former residence of the plant explorer David Fairchild, to the National Tropical Botanical Garden as a refuge and retreat for horticulturalists.         After she helped finance the Norwegian explorers Finn and Jackie Ronne in an expedition to Antarctica in the late 1940's, the Ronnes named the Sweeney Mountains in her honor.         She was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Rye, N.Y., and a life trustee and national board member of the Aspen Music Festival and School in Aspen, Colo.         Born Catherine Denkmann Hauberg, she was a granddaughter and grandniece of the two brothers who established the company that became the Weyerhauser lumber empire.         She was a graduate of Dana Hall in Wellesley, Mass., and of the University of Illinois. Her husband, Edward C. Sweeney, a former president of the Explorers Club, died in 1967.         Mrs. Sweeney is survived by her children, Edward Jr., of Black Forest, Colo.; Philip, of Amherst, Mass.; John, of Aspen, Colo.; Susie Kayyali of Coral Gables, Fla., and Harriet Fraunfelter of Washington; her brother, John Hauberg Jr. of Seattle; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Joan R. Cook, a former reporter and union leader at The New York Times who was a principal organizer of a successful 1974 sex-discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper, died Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her daughter, Jezebel, of Manhattan.         Ms. Cook was a reporter in metropolitan news when she retired from The Times in 1991.         In 1974, when women at The Times filed a class-action suit accusing it of discrimination, she was one of seven named plaintiffs. The case was settled in 1978 with cash payments and an affirmative-action plan.         She was elected head of the New York Newspaper Guild's Times unit in 1980, the first woman in the post.         Ms. Cook was born in Portland, Ore., and attended the University of California at Los Angeles. In 1940, she joined The Minneapolis Star-Journal and Tribune, working in classified advertising. In 1949, she moved to Paris, where she wrote a column for the Paris edition of The Herald Tribune. She joined The Times in Family/Style in 1959 and transferred to metropolitan news in 1972 as a New Jersey correspondent.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two other children, John Barlow of Winchester, England, and Joseph Cook of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Catherine, of Pearl River, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  February 18, 1995, Saturday         An obituary on Feb. 6 about Joan R. Cook, a former reporter and Newspaper Guild leader at The New York Times, referred incorrectly to women's history in the union leadership at The Times. Ms. Cook, who was elected in 1980 to head the guild's Times unit, was not the first woman to do so. The first was Jerre Smoot, in the 1940's.       
         Bella Fishko, an art dealer and founder of the Forum Gallery, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, Robert, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Fishko, whose original name was Bella Gold, was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1913 and moved to the United States with her parents in 1923. She attended Hunter College and in the early 1940's began working at the A.C.A. Gallery. After leaving A.C.A. in the late 1950's, she established the Forum Gallery, specializing in American figurative art. The artists represented by the gallery, now at 745 Fifth Avenue, include Raphael Soyer, Chaim Gross, David Levine and Gregory Gillespie. Mrs. Fishko retired in 1988 and was succeeded by her son.         Mrs. Fishko's husband, Sol, died in 1989. In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Sara Gill, and four grandchildren, all of Manhattan.       
         Loyce Houlton, a leader in American regional dance and a choreographer whose works were performed by companies in the United States and Europe, died on Tuesday at United Hospital in St. Paul. She was 70 and lived in Minneapolis.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Lise Houlton Gilliland, a former member of American Ballet Theater and the Stuttgart Ballet.         Mrs. Houlton favored a rhapsodic choreographic style that combined ballet with various modern-dance techniques. She created more than 90 works, many of them to contemporary music, and her Minnesota Dance Theater became known for its experimental productions. Ballets by her have also been presented by Dance Theater of Harlem, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Deutsche Oper Ballet of Berlin.         A tiny and perpetually restless woman, Mrs. Houlton liked to say to students: "Explode! Be voracious in space." Yet for the last two decades of her life, she was in chronic ill health. Undaunted, she once said in an interview that her illness had significantly changed her choreography. "I have more courage now," she declared.         Mrs. Houlton, a native of Duluth, Minn., studied dance at Carleton College and New York University and at several New York ballet and modern-dance schools. After settling in Minneapolis, she founded the Contemporary Dance Playhouse in 1962; seven years later, it was renamed Minnesota Dance Theater. Financial problems in 1986 forced the company to disband. But in the last few years, Mrs. Houlton had attempted to reorganize it, and last summer, it revived two of her important works: her version of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," and "Ancient Air," to music by George Crumb, an American composer she particularly admired.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Dr. William Houlton; three sons, Laif, Joel and Andrew, and four grandchildren, all of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Jewell Kraemer of Wausau, Wis., and Ardeth Becher of St. Paul.       
         Marjorie Kahn Unterberg, a philanthropist and volunteer in the health care field, died yesterday at Lennox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan and Tinton Falls, N.J.         The cause was complications after surgery, said her daughter, Mary A. DeBare of Manhattan.         Until her death, Mrs. Unterberg was active in a nursing scholarship program at Monmouth College in Long Branch, N.J. She was former president of the School of Nursing at Monmouth Medical Center, where she established the Center for Nursing Excellence, an educational program. She was also a former vice president of the board of governors at the medical center.         Mrs. Unterberg was the widow of Clarence E. Unterberg, founder of the Wall Street brokerage firm of C. E. Unterberg, Towbin. He died in 1987.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Thomas I. Unterberg of Manhattan, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Constance Morrow Morgan, a longtime Smith College trustee, died on Saturday in Portland, Ore., at the home of her son, Rhidian. She was 81 and lived in Ridgefield, Wash., and North Haven, Me.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Morgan was born in Englewood, N.J. Her father was Dwight Whitney Morrow, Ambassador to Mexico from 1927 to 1930; her sister is the writer Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the wife of the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh.         She graduated from Smith in 1935, and married Aubrey Niel Morgan in 1937. Mr. Morgan died 10 years ago.         Mrs. Morgan was a Smith trustee from 1964 to 1971, serving as board chairwoman for four years. She was also an active supporter of the Marshall Fellows Program.         In addition to her sister and son, Mrs. Morgan is survived by three daughters, Saran Hutchins of Chicago, Elisabeth Pendleton of Washington and Margaret Eiluned Morgan of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Maude B. Feld, a retired Manhattan antiques dealer and expert on early American glassware, died on March 13 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         She advised collectors, dealers and museums, and researched the history of the reproduction of antique glassware in Italy. She also helped to assemble collections of Wedgwood pottery and American art glass that later were donated to the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Born in Passaic, N.J., she opened a shop in New Jersey in the mid-1930's and moved it to Madison Avenue in 1959. She retired about 15 years ago.         Mrs. Feld is survived by her husband of 70 years, Samuel B.; two sons, Dr. Alan, of Las Vegas, and Stuart P., of Manhattan, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Mildred Henry Gross, who wrote for several radio drama serials popular during the 1940's and 50's, died on Tuesday in Stuart, Fla. She was 93.         Mrs. Gross, who wrote under the name Mildred Henry Merrill, spent the early part of her career in Detroit, where she was a staff writer at the radio station WXYZ, the originating station for many shows broadcast over the ABC Network. She wrote episodes for shows including "The Long Ranger," "The Green Hornet" and "Preston of the Yukon."         In the mid-1950's, she moved to New York City, where she wrote for the radio shows "Official Detective," "Under Arrest" and "Bobby Benson," as well as a series for the Mutual Broadcasting Network called "Mr. Mystery."         She is survived by a son, Theodore B. Merrill of Piermont, N.Y.; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Jean Davis, a philanthropist and the mother of Marvin Davis, the billionaire financier and former owner of 20th Century Fox, died on Feb. 21 at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 94 and had lived most of her life in Manhattan.         The cause was respiratory failure, said a spokesman for the family.         In her later years, Mrs. Davis worked closely with her daughter-in-law, Barbara Davis, to raise money for the Children's Diabetes Foundation in Denver and for multiple sclerosis research. She was also active in raising money for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society and the United Jewish Appeal.         Besides her son, Marvin, she is survived by 14 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  March 10, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Wednesday about Jean Davis, a philanthropist and the mother of the financier Marvin Davis, omitted a surviving daughter. She is Joan Davis Chorney of Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Margery Mastbaum Solomon, one of America's leading bridge players, died on Saturday at her home in Elkins Park, Pa. She was 86.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said her daughter Norma Brunswick of Rydal, Pa.         Mrs. Solomon, who was always known as Peggy, represented the United States in several international bridge competitions. In 1972, she was a member of the American team that finished third in the World Team Olympiad.         Her most important success was a victory in the National Board-a-Match Teams, now called the Reisinger Teams, in 1944. She won nine other national titles in the Mixed Teams in 1949, 1950 and 1959; the Women's Teams in 1948, 1953, 1954, 1961 and 1967, and the Women's Pairs in 1960. Her 14 second-place results included all three major national team championships, the Spingold Knockout in 1944, the Board-a-Match in 1953 and the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1954. In 1944 she became the 33d person, and only the third woman, to reach the rank of life master.         Mrs. Solomon was a member of a prominent Philadelphia family. Her father, Jules Mastbaum, a real estate investor who owned a chain of movie theaters, bought many Rodin sculptures in France and built a museum to house them. The Rodin Museum was presented to the City of Philadelphia and opened in 1927 shortly after his death.         Her second husband, Charles Solomon, a former president of the American Contract Bridge League and the World Bridge Federation, died in 1975. She was previously married to Benjamin Golder, a Pennsylvania member of the House of Representatives for 12 years who also headed the national bridge organization; Mr. Golder died in 1946.         In addition to Mrs. Brunswick, Mrs. Solomon is survived by a sister, Lisa Dickson of Beverly Hills, Calif.; another daughter, Joan Ash of Elkins Park; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Blanche Rangel, a retired garment worker and mother of United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. A Harlem resident, she was 90.         She had a long illness, according to Mr. Rangel's office in Washington.         Mrs. Rangel worked in the garment industry from 1943 until her retirement in 1965.         Besides Mr. Rangel, she is survived by a daughter, Frances McDermott of the Bronx; a brother, Percy Wharton of Camden, N.J.; a sister, Sylvia Curtis of Manhattan, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Muriel Resnik, a novelist and playwright best known for her comedy "Any Wednesday," died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 and had recently lived in Beaufort, N.C.         The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her husband, Victor Jackson.         "Any Wednesday," which starred Sandy Dennis, Don Porter, Gene Hackman and Rosemary Murphy, opened on Broadway in 1964 to rave reviews. The instant success of the play, Ms. Resnik's first, took even the author by surprise. In an interview, she said, "I was just praying it wouldn't be a complete bomb." It was later made into a movie starring Jane Fonda and Jason Robards.         Ms. Resnik was born in New Haven. She wrote several novels, including "Life Without Father," "House Happy" and "The Girl in the Turquoise Bikini." She later wrote "Son of Any Wednesday," a reflection on the production of the play. In 1992, her first murder mystery, "The Garden Club," was published, and at her death she was nearing completion of a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Michael, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Henry, of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Lillian Stamler of Stony Creek, Conn., and Jean Krosner of New York City; three grandchildren, and a great-grandson.       
         Barbara Mercati, who was active in cultural, charitable and volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. Mrs. Mercati, who also lived in Vineyard Haven, Mass., on Martha's Vineyard, was 87.         The cause of death was cancer, said her son George.         Mrs. Mercati served as a member of the national council of the Metropolitan Opera, a director of the English Speaking Union and in many capacities with Recording for the Blind, including vice president of its board and director emeritus, a post she held at her death.         Mrs. Mercati was the widow of the Baron Antonio d'Almeida, who died in 1947; of the investment banker, diplomat and philanthropist Paul Felix Warburg, who died in 1965, and of Count Leonardo Mercati, who died in 1974. She was also the mother of the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida.         Mrs. Mercati, the former Barbara Tapper, was born in 1907 in Pasadena, Calif., and spent her childhood in Highland Park, Ill.         Besides her sons George, of Selvole, Italy, and Antonio, of St. Remy de Provence, France, Mrs. Mercati is survived by her son Louis d'Almeida of Manhattan, five grandchildren and a great-grandchild. Other survivors include 5 stepdaughters, 14 step-grandchildren and 5 step-great grandchildren.       
         Norma Fields Furst, the president of Baltimore Hebrew University for the last three years, died on March 7 at her home in Wynnewood, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She was associated with Temple University from 1963 to 1983 in various positions, including full professor and finally dean of student affairs. She then was president of Harcum Junior College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., before joining Baltimore Hebrew in 1992.         She was active in many national and local organizations, including International B'nai B'rith/Hillel Commission, the Jewish Publication Society, and the American Association of University Women.         A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Furst was a graduate of Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in education and a doctorate in educational psychology at Temple.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. M. Lawrence Furst; a son, Merrick, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Laura F. Jacobs of Merion, Pa.; her mother, Anne Platzer of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.       
         Madeleine Herling, a businesswoman and philanthropist, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 75. Besides her home in Manhattan, she had residences in Miami Beach, Zurich and Sao Paolo, Brazil.         The cause was complications from leukemia, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Herling was owner and president of the Jolie Gabor Jewelry Store in Manhattan. Along with her husband, Erwin, she established the Countess Madeleine Galleries Ltd. in Manhattan. The galleries featured the works of Eastern European artists.         Active in many charitable causes, she aided the Magdalena Home for the Elderly in her native Budapest, the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem and the Emanuel Foundation in Manhattan. She was a major contributor to the building of Holocaust museums in Washington and Budapest.         Besides her husband of 48 years, she is survived by her son, Thomas, of Huntington, L.I.; a brother, Laszlo Steingisser of Chile, and four grandchildren.       
         Ludmilla B. Turkevich, an expert in Russian language and literature who was the first woman to teach at Princeton and then spent 18 years as chairwoman of the Russian department at Douglass College of Rutgers University, died on Friday at the Princeton Medical Center. She was 85 and lived at the Monroe retirement village in Jamesburg, N.J.         Her family said the cause of death was respiratory failure.         She had the academic credentials, including degrees from New York University and Bryn Mawr and a doctorate from Columbia. She had been speaking and reading Russian with an informed passion since she was a child and had added Spanish as a sub-specialty. And she had experience as a teacher at the University of Kansas and at Douglass College, in New Brunswick, N.J.         Yet if there had not been a war on in 1944, and if Princeton had not found itself without a single Russian teacher at a time when there was a sudden, almost panicky upsurge in interest in the Soviet Union, it is doubtful that the university would have allowed the former Ludmilla Buketoff of New Britain, Conn., to be more than a faculty wife, the bride of John Turkevich, a professor of chemistry.         Even after Princeton did allow her on the faculty in 1944, the university, which would wait a quarter-century more before admitting women as students, insisted on maintaining a certain distinction. During the 17 years Mrs. Turkevich taught Russian and Spanish literature and a popular course on the modern European novel, she was relegated to the position of lecturer, subject to annual contract renewals.         When Rutgers offered in 1961 to make her a full professor at Douglass, its women's division, she accepted, and spent the next 18 years dazzling students like her own daughter, Tamar Skvir, who recalled her mother yesterday as a mesmerizing lecturer who made Pushkin, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy come alive.         Professor Turkevich, who also held research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study and the Center for Theological Inquiry at Princeton and served as the president of the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and Eastern European Languages, wrote widely on Russian literature.         Her books include "Cervantes in Russia" (1950), "Masterpieces in Russian Literature" (1964) and "Spanish Literature in Russia and the Soviet Union 1735-1964" (1967).         She and her husband were also instrumental in the translation and publication of the "Guide to Russian Scientific Literature" in the 1940's and wrote the textbook "Russian for the Scientist" (1959).         Professor Turkevich also served as a specialist in American education at the United States exhibit in Moscow in 1959.         In addition to her husband and her daughter Tamar, she is survived by another daughter, Marina Naumann of Norwich, Vt., and four grandchildren.       
         Pauline Ames Plimpton, who had a late-blooming career as a writer that startled but not did not surprise her famous literary offspring, George Plimpton, died yesterday at her home in New York City. She was 93.         Her family said the cause was circulatory illness.         As the daughter, wife and mother of famous men, Mrs. Plimpton spent most of her life in the shadow of her father, Oakes Ames, the Harvard botanist; her husband, Francis T. P. Plimpton, the lawyer and diplomat, who died in 1983, and her son, George, the multifaceted editor of The Paris Review.         But at the age of 79, as her son put it yesterday, "she suddenly came out from underneath," and started writing books, concentrating, appropriately enough for a novice writer, on what she knew best: her family.         Among the eight books she turned out over the next dozen years was one about her father: "Oakes Ames, Jottings of a Harvard Botanist," (Botanical Museum of Harvard, 1979); one about her husband: "The Plimpton Papers, Law and Diplomacy" (University Press of America, 1985) and even one about her father-in-law, a wide-ranging literary collector: "A Collector's Recollections, George Arthur Plimpton" (Columbia University Library, 1992).         Mr. Plimpton said he had not been surprised at his mother's literary emergence.         "As a young girl," he said, "she kept wonderful diaries."         Mrs. Plimpton, a graduate of Smith College, also served on the boards of Planned Parenthood, the Institute for World Affairs and the Public Education Association.         In addition to George, she is survived by two other sons, Francis T. P. Plimpton Jr. of Ormond Beach, Fla. and Oakes A. Plimpton of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Plimpton of New York; a brother, Amyas Ames of Syosset, L.I., seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren.

         Bernice Levy Rudnick, a philanthropist active with organizations in New York City and in Palm Beach, Fla., died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 and also lived in Palm Beach.         The cause was cancer, according to a spokeswoman for Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Yeshiva University, which her family had long supported.         She and her husband, Cecil N. Rudnick, financed laboratories for research on Alzheimer's disease at the medical school and a meditation chapel at the college's Jack D. Weiler Hospital in the Bronx. At her death, she was vice chairman of the board at Albert Einstein.         Mrs. Rudnick was born in Manhattan and graduated from Wellesley College, where she remained active in alumni programs.         In addition to her husband of 57 years, Mrs. Rudnick is survived by two sons, David, of Palm Beach, and Andrew, of Buffalo, and two grandchildren.       
         Marion Burbank Stevens Rice, a noted teacher and producer of dance by the pioneering modern dancers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, died on April 12 at the Highlands Long Term Care Center in Fitchburg, Mass.. She was 90 and lived in Ashby, Mass.         Mrs. Rice was known for the purity and vitality of her dancers and her dance restagings. She learned the Denishawn technique and most of the dances in the late 1920's and early 30's at the Braggiotti-Denishawn School of Dance in Boston, where she studied with Shawn and others. From 1929 through 1988, she was director of the Marion Rice Studio of the Dance in Fitchburg, Mass., and she continued to teach in the area after closing her school.         Mrs. Rice founded her own company, Marion Rice Denishawn Dancers, in the 1940's. The group gained widespread attention and critical praise in 1972 when it performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. The company received even greater critical praise five years later when it performed in its New York City debut, featuring the 72-year-old Mrs. Rice in a St. Denis solo.         In 1980, Mrs. Rice was invited to stage her version of "Soaring," a 1920 dance created by St. Denis and Doris Humphry, for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montreal. The next year, the troupe participated in "The Early Years: American Modern Dance from 1900 through the 1930's," a festival organized by the State University of New York at Purchase. Mrs. Rice continued to teach until recently.         Mrs. Rice's husband, J. Parker Rice, died in 1965. She is survived by a daughter, Carolyn Brown of Millbrook, N.Y., a former lead dancer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; a son, J. Parker Rice Jr. of Ashburnham, Mass.; a sister, Elinor Stevens Cloutier of Ashburnham; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Avery Rowell, a cellist who was one of the country's best-known teachers of the instrument, died on April 21 at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.         The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter-in-law, Barbara Rowell.         Mrs. Rowell taught for 14 years at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Mills College and San Francisco State University.         Among her former students are Paul Tobias, a faculty member of the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and Bonnie Hampton, the president of Chamber Music America and a member of the San Francisco Trio.         Her husband, Edward Z. Rowell, a speech and philosophy professor at the University of California, died in 1975. She is survived by a son, Galen, of Berkeley, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Vita R. Ostrander, a former president of the American Association of Retired Persons who helped make the health care system a major national issue a decade before last year's debate on overhauling it, died on Tuesday at Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta. She was 72 and lived in suburban Decatur.         Her family said she had a heart attack while recovering from back surgery.         Mrs. Ostrander was a member of the A.A.R.P.'s board from 1976 to 1988 and its president for two of those years, 1984-86. She had earned those unpaid positions through her volunteer work in Georgia as an advocate for the elderly, and during her dozen years on the board gained a reputation as an effective advocate both inside and outside the huge organization, which now claims 33 million members.         "She really brought us into health care," the current president, Eugene Lehrmann, said yesterday, recalling that she had often built support for her views even as she formed them, in informal chats with fellow board members.         When the association, under her prodding, spoke out in favor of fee controls and a combination of private insurance and Government subsidies to pay for prescription drugs and catastrophic illnesses, it was often Mrs. Ostrander who did the speaking.         In an organization that likes to precycle as well as recycle its executive talent, Mrs. Ostrander was a representative at news conferences during her two years as president-elect, testified at Congressional hearings during her two years as president and continued to speak out during her two years as "immediate past president," an official association position.         Not one to shrink from confrontation, she once told a meeting of the American Medical Association that high costs had created a form of rationing of health care. And when she served on a Federal advisory panel that made only a vague reference to a need for Government subsidies in a report stressing the role of private insurance in protecting Americans against catastrophic medical costs, Mrs. Ostrander issued a stinging dissent, chiding her fellow panelists for obscuring a need for Government participation.         A native of Utica, N.Y., where her father operated a bakery, Mrs. Ostrander, whose maiden name was Romano, received a nursing degree from the University of Buffalo and spent 10 years as a Red Cross executive before settling in Atlanta and becoming a full-time volunteer on issues involving the elderly.         She is survived by her husband, Gladding, a retired Red Cross executive; a daughter, Sylvia Lucas of Columbia, S.C., and three grandchildren.       
         Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural, philanthropic and environmental causes, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause of death was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Goldman was the president of the sisterhood of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue and the chairwoman of the book and author series of UJA-Federation of New York.         In 1977 she co-founded the Council for a Beautiful Israel, an environmental group, with Ora Herzog, a former First Lady of Israel.         Mrs. Goldman was also active in the women's division of the American Technion Society and the Yeshiva University women's organization.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jacob E. Goldman; a brother, Rabbi Burton Mehler of the Bronx; three sisters, Jean Kelman of Queens and Gloria Mehler and Mindella Lamm of Manhattan; three sons, Shalom L., of East Thetford, Vt., and Ari L. and Dov E., of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         She is also survived by three stepchildren, Melvin Goldman of Chevy Chase, Md., Edith Goldman-Hoffman of Brookline, Mass., and Beth Goldman of Manhattan.         Correction:  May 3, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Sunday about Judith A. Goldman, who was long active in Jewish cultural and philanthropic causes, misspelled the given name of a former First Lady of Israel with whom she founded an environmental group. The former First Lady is Aura Herzog, not Ora.
