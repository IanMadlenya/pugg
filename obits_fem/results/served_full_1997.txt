         Katharine Homer Fryer, an artist, teacher and writer who devoted much of her later life to the mentally disturbed, died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 89 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         At her death, she was president of the Schizophrenia Foundation of New York, which provides information on alternative treatments for the illness. She headed the foundation since 1969, shortly after its creation.         She also was director emeritus of the Fryer Research Center, an outpatient clinic in the former Murray Hill Hospital on East 40th Street in Manhattan. It offers a biochemical-nutritional approach to emotional and mental conditions, like schizophrenia and depression, as well as physical disorders.         She founded the nonprofit center in 1971 to help people who could not otherwise afford such treatment, and remained its director until a few months ago. Her daughter and successor, Dr. Kathy Fryer, estimated yesterday that the center had served more than 10,000 people and their families.         Mrs. Fryer's dedication stemmed in large part from living with mental illness in her immediate family. One of her five daughters, Barbara, committed suicide in 1968 at age 31, after spending 10 years in a succession of treatments for schizophrenia.         In a new book, ''The Story of Barbara,'' Mrs. Fryer wrote of her daughter's condition, which might have had a different outcome with the alternative treatments for schizophrenia emerging then. The book is to be published by Rivercross Publishing later this year.         An earlier book was ''Kathy: A Mother's True Story of a Young Girl's Fight to Regain Health'' (Dutton, 1956). It told of her daughter Kathy's successful emergence from a mysterious ailment that befell her at 13 and a mother's years of searching for the right diagnosis and cure.         Mrs. Fryer wrote of the ''unexpected, miraculous'' deliverance when Kathy's condition was recognized and swiftly overcome. It proved to be a complex case of severe thyroid deficiency aggravated by psychological problems.         Mrs. Fryer published a second book in 1994, ''Till Death Do Us Part,'' on life with her husband, Dr. Douglas Fryer, a pioneer in industrial psychology and a prolific author, whom she married in 1934. A former head of the Department of Psychology at New York University, he died in 1960.         Katharine Homer was born in New York City to two well-known parents, Sidney Homer, a composer of chamber music and songs, and Louise Homer, a Metropolitan Opera contralto. In the 1920's, she studied piano, singing and painting under distinguished teachers at the Curtis Institute of Music, Mannes College of Music and the Arts League in New York, and at l'Ecole Julienne in Paris.         For several years, she traveled as her mother's accompanist before touring on her own as a solo pianist and with chamber music groups. She exhibited her paintings in New York and Paris.         In 1932, she organized a 50-member girls' choir in Scarsdale, N.Y., and directed it until 1951. She also organized and directed an adult choir in Rye, N.Y., in the 1960's.         All along, until her work at the foundation and center became a primary occupation, she privately taught piano, singing and painting. She also served stints as a piano teacher at the Manhattan School of Music in the 1930's, and more recently at the Brearley School.         Besides Dr. Fryer, a Manhattan resident, she is survived by three other daughters, Dr. Judith Shedden, Anne Eddis and Dr. Sarah Leibowitz, all of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Katherine Pollak Ellickson, a retired labor economist with a lifelong commitment to the women's and union movements, died on Dec. 28 at the White Sands retirement community in La Jolla, Calif. She was 91 and had lived in Washington until 1978.         Ms. Ellickson was long associated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations and, later, with the merged A.F.L.-C.I.O.         She served as executive director of the White House Commission on the Status of Women during the Kennedy Administration.         A native of Yonkers, she grew up in Manhattan and studied economics at Vassar College, graduating in 1926.         She started her career in workers' education at Brookwood Labor College and also did field work in Southern textile mills and coal camps in West Virginia.         She did organizational work for the C.I.O. in the late 1930's and joined its national office as associate director of research in 1942.         Among her duties was liaison with the Bureau of Labor Statistics.         In 1961, she was enlisted to help prepar the President's Commission on the Status of Women and became is executive director under Eleanor Roosevelt and Esther Peterson.         She also assisted in the creation of the Federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in the early 1960's.         She retired in 1967 after a brief stint with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.         She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Senturia of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Robert C., of Woodbridge, Conn., and three grandchildren. Her husband, John C. Ellickson, died in 1970.       
         Marie Torre, a former television columnist for The New York Herald Tribune who was jailed for refusing to disclose a source in a libel action, died on Friday at Health South Rehabilitation Hospital of Greater Pittsburgh in Monroeville, Pa. She was 72 and lived in Salem, N.J.         She died of lung cancer, said her son-in-law, Ed Lopez of Manhattan.         Miss Torre served 10 days in the Hudson County Jail in New Jersey in 1959, the first reporter to gain national attention for going to jail for refusing to identify a news source.         Miss Torre, who shortened her last name from Torregrossa, was born in Brooklyn. She joined the Herald Tribune staff in 1955. As a radio and television columnist in 1957, she quoted a CBS executive, whom she did not name, as saying that Judy Garland was balking about doing a CBS special ''because she thinks she is terribly fat.''         Miss Garland sued the network for $1.39 million, and Miss Torre, as a witness in a pretrial hearing, was ordered by the court to disclose the name of her source. She refused, arguing that a reporter should not be compelled to reveal sources in court because such an order violated the First Amendment's guarantee of press freedom.         ''She never revealed his name, even to members of our family,'' Mr. Lopez said yesterday.         Judge Sylvester Ryan of Federal District Court in Manhattan warned her that she could be jailed for contempt of court. When she again refused, he sentenced her to 10 days in jail. The case drew attention and support from news organizations.         Miss Torre, with The Herald Tribune's backing, appealed the sentence, but it was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals in New York. In his opinion, Judge Potter Stewart, who later served on the United States Supreme Court, conceded that ''compulsory disclosure of a journalist's confidential sources of information may entail an abridgment of press freedom.'' But he added that ''the duty of a witness to testify in a court of law has roots as deep as the guarantee of a free press.'' He held that Miss Torre must yield ''to a paramount public interest in the fair administration of justice.''         The Supreme Court refused to review the decision, but Miss Garland did not pursue the case once Miss Torre's jail term ended.         Miss Torre did a radio talk show in Wilmington, Del., until August, when she was hospitalized.         She is survived by a daughter, Roma Torre of Manhattan, a news anchorwoman; a son, Adam Jeffrey Friedman of Los Angeles; a brother, John Torregrossa of Panama City, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Dorathi Bock Pierre, a theatrical publicist and dance writer, died on Jan. 2 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 96.         During a long career, Ms. Pierre served as press representative for tours by such groups as the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, American Ballet Theater, the Old Vic, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Comedie Francaise and the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden.         A champion of the arts in Southern California, she served as public relations director for such Los Angeles organizations as the Greek Theater Association, the Hollywood Bowl, the Free Shakespeare Festival and the Los Angeles Ballet.         Ms. Pierre contributed articles to The American Dancer and Dance magazine and founded and edited The Journal of Educational Dance from 1938 to 1942.         Ms. Pierre, whose father was Richard W. Bock, a sculptor, was born in Chicago. At 16, she danced with the Michel Fokine Ballet. She moved to Los Angeles after marrying Jacques J. Pierre, a theatrical producer. In 1991 she edited ''Memoirs of an American Artist: The Sculptor Richard W. Bock,'' a book about her father.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Pilar Barbosa de Rosario, a revered Puerto Rican historian and political authority who served as teacher, mentor and mother confessor to generations of Puerto Rican politicians, scholars and intellectuals, died on Wednesday at a hospital near her home in San Juan. She was 99 and widely regarded as the conscience of the ruling New Progressive Party.         In a career in which, in 1921, she became the first woman to teach at the University of Puerto Rico and later established the departments of history and social studies there, Dr. Barbosa became such an authority on Puerto Rican political history, from the movement for autonomy from Spain in the late 19th century to the drive for statehood in the 20th, that she was named the commonwealth's official historian in 1993.         It was a further reflection of her standing that after her death Gov. Pedro Rossello decreed a three-day period of mourning and that half a dozen members of the Legislature formed an honor guard at her coffin during a wake on Wednesday night.         The only reason a state funeral was not planned was that Dr. Barbosa had asked for private ceremonies, and as virtually any political figure in Puerto Rico would attest, Dr. Barbosa's wishes had long been treated as commands.         Indeed, long after she retired in 1967, Dr. Barbosa remained an influential figure in Puerto Rican politics -- a gregarious and vivacious woman with such a magnetic personality and wide-ranging knowledge of political history and current events that students, politicians and government officials trooped to her door for her counsel and her company.         ''It was an intellectual watering hole,'' said Gonzalo Cordova, a friend who began teaching history at the university the year she retired. ''You didn't come to drink, but for the conversation.''         To Kenneth McClintock, a 40-year-old member of the Puerto Rican Senate, her wealth of political and historical knowledge was understandable. ''As she was growing up,'' he said, ''history was made at her dining room table.''         Her father, Jose Celso Barbosa, was the founder of the Puerto Rican statehood movement and the precursor of the New Progressive Party, which has continued to embrace his ideals -- as modified over the years, to be sure, by his daughter, who insisted that the party of statehood also commit itself to social justice.         This, too, was a tribute to the legacy of her father. He was a black man who was so outraged at being denied higher education by the Spanish that after graduating first in his class at the University of Michigan medical school in 1882 -- and even then allowed to practice in Puerto Rico only after the intervention of the American consul in San Juan -- that he became a leader of the autonomy movement.         Having found a measure of racial and civil justice in 19th-century America after the United States displaced the Spanish in 1898, he espoused statehood as the best way to guarantee similar rights in Puerto Rico.         As one of his 12 children, Dr. Barbosa, whose mother died when she was a toddler, inherited her father's intelligence and his ideals. When she began teaching at the University of Puerto Rico in 1921 she was still an undergraduate herself, and the university was little more than a teacher's college.         After graduating in 1924, she moved on to Clark University in Worcester, Mass., receiving a master's in 1925 and a doctorate the next year.         Over the next decades Dr. Barbosa researched and wrote numerous books, pamphlets and papers on Puerto Rican political history, some based on her father's papers.         Partly, perhaps, because she and her husband, Jose Ezequiel Rosario, an economics professor who died in 1963, had no children, Dr. Barbosa began receiving her students for informal consultations on Saturday afternoons.         The sessions, which began in the days she lived in a farmhouse on the outskirts of San Juan, were continued after she retired and moved to a condominium in the city's Santurce section, but with a difference.         Because she no longer had a teaching load to keep her busy during the week, her proteges took to calling on her any day of the week.         By the time many of them had risen to high positions in the government, Dr. Barbosa, who also maintained friendly relationships with members of other parties, had acquired so much influence that she operated almost as a political boss -- a boss who seemed so blind to her own power that she may not have realized that an off-hand criticism delivered in a private conversation would soon be altering party policy.         Dr. Barbosa is survived by a brother, Rafael Barbosa, of Carolina, P.R.       
         Louise Roberts, who directed the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan, died on Jan. 17 at Bellevue Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         In her nearly three decades of presenting dance, Ms. Roberts helped shape the careers of many fledgling avant-garde and black choreographers who later became major modern dance artists, among them Kei Takei, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and Bill T. Jones. A small, rotund woman with an earthy sense of humor, Ms. Roberts also served as a patient yet eminently practical ''great mother figure,'' as Alvin Ailey put it, to several generations of modern dancers.         A central tenet of her career as a dance producer was that no one should be excluded from dance because of imperfect bodies or the color of their skin. She also believed that dance ought to be available to everyone, whether through the low-cost classes at Clark Center or affordable concerts. She wanted, she said in a 1986 interview, to ''offer people the opportunity to take chances.''         Born in Boston, Ms. Roberts attended Hunter College in Manhattan, graduating in 1931 with a degree in political science. It was during her college years that Ms. Roberts began to study dance seriously, performing  with Blanche Evan. When her husband, Paul Ziporkis, died in 1953, Ms. Roberts was left with a daughter to bring up alone. She worked as a magazine caption writer, an administrator at the Downtown Community School and as the director of the June Taylor School before moving on to Clark Center in 1970.         A friendship with Donald McKayle, a young choreographer, led to her first experience producing dance when Mr. McKayle asked her for help in putting on a concert at the 92d Street Y. Ms. Roberts continued to present dance regularly at Clark Center, where Alvin Ailey had started his company in the 1960's. The center is also where Wendy Wasserstein had the first staged reading of one of her plays.         From 1975 to 1978, Ms. Roberts produced a summer dance festival in the mall at the City College Graduate Center on West 42d Street. Her dreams of moving Clark Center from small, dingy studios on Eighth Avenue to a new theater and studio complex on the West 42d Street Theater Row in the mid-80's were dashed after the city reneged on promised support. Ms. Roberts rebounded with an ambitious eight-week series at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row in 1986, the year she resigned from Clark Center. ''We're going to be dancing on 42d Street,'' she told a reporter. ''I may cry a lot, but that's what we're going to do.'' The Clark Center closed in 1988.         Ms. Roberts was a Capezio Award honoree in 1991 and won a Bessie Award in 1986.         She is survived by a daughter, Karen deFrancis of Brooklyn, and a stepsister, Grace Herman of Manhattan.       
         Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska, a founder of Mazowsze, the Polish State Folk Song and Dance Ensemble, died on Sunday in Warsaw. She was 96.         Ms. Ziminska-Sygietynska became famous as a cabaret singer for whom leading Polish poets wrote songs. She also acted in films and edited the satirical magazine Duby Smalone (Fish Stories). She worked as a nurse for the underground in Nazi-occupied Warsaw during World War II and sang at clandestine concerts to raise money for war victims.         Work with children from small villages after the war led her and her husband, Tadeusz Sygietynski, to found the Mazowsze ensemble in 1948. Students were chosen by audition for lessons in music and dance and a general education at Karolin, a country estate outside Warsaw where the company still trains.         The aim of Mazowsze was to present traditional music and dance carefully adapted for the stage, with the performers wearing traditional Polish dress adapted by Ms. Ziminska-Sygietynska. Public performances began in 1950. Mr. Sygietynski, a composer, died in 1955.         The company made its American debut in 1961 and is now on tour in the United States. For many years, Ms. Ziminska-Sygietynska traveled with the group. Lively and plain-spoken, she chided picketers of the company in Chicago in 1982 who were opposed to the Polish Government. ''Our Government does things we don't like,'' she said firmly. ''I only represent art, not government. Art goes its own direction, politics its own.''         She served as director of company up to her death.       
         Sally Ganz, an art collector and benefactor of educational and cultural organizations, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         With her husband, Victor W. Ganz, a vice president and longtime trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art who died in 1987, Mrs. Ganz accumulated works by Picasso, Jasper Johns, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and other artists whom the couple championed and befriended.         An independent, spirited woman with a husky tobacco voice, Ms. Ganz was recalled by Kirk Varnedoe, the chief curator of paintings and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, as ''tough-minded, seriously dedicated to what she believed in.'' It happened that several works she had loaned to the Modern's Johns retrospective, which closed last week, were returned to her just yesterday.         As a founding volunteer of Public Education Association, an advocacy group, Mrs. Ganz helped students in New York City learn to read. Over the years she organized exhibitions to benefit the group, including a Picasso show in 1962 on which she asked John Richardson, who would become Picasso's biographer, to collaborate. She also sponsored minority scholarships at Barnard College and served for years on the board of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Most recently, she gave money to Helen Keller International to combat river blindness in Africa.         She was born Sally Wile in Louisville, Ky., on Jan. 16, 1912. She studied journalism at the University of Wisconsin, then moved to Manhattan, where she worked at Macy's. In 1935 she met Mr. Ganz, who ran a family costume jewelry business.  They married in 1942.         For years they almost exclusively bought works by Picasso, including, in 1956, his series derived from Delacroix's ''Women of Algiers.'' In the 1960's they branched out to collect works by younger, American artists, becoming frequent lenders to exhibitions and occasional donors, especially to the Whitney. They gave works by Mr. Johns, Mr. Stella and Claes Oldenberg to the museum. Last year Mrs. Ganz also donated a drawing by Tom Levine, a young New York artist.         Mrs. Ganz is survived by a son, Tony, of Los Angeles; three daughters, Victoria DeFelice of Newport Beach, Calif., Kate Ganz Dorment of London and Nancy Wright of La Canada, Calif., and six grandchildren.       
         Casey Miller, a writer and editor who was a pioneering advocate of nonsexist language, died on Sunday at her home in East Haddam, Conn. She was 77.         Kate Swift, her close friend and co-author, said the cause of death was chronic obstructive lung disease.         Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift co-wrote numerous books and articles on English usage and its relationship to the status of women. Writing in a climate of increasing sensitivity and opposition to language that relegated women to secondary status, Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift waged a forceful campaign against what many considered sexist language. If not all their proposals (like ''genkind'' to replace mankind) found their way into everyday usage, the women nonetheless helped to raise awareness of oppression by language.         Ms. Miller and Ms. Swift were the authors of ''Words and Women,'' published in 1976 by Doubleday and 1991 by HarperCollins, and ''The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing,'' published in 1980 by Lippincott & Crowell and in 1988 by HarperCollins. They also wrote many articles on sexism in English that appeared in national periodicals and in more than 30 anthologies and textbooks.         They achieved widespread recognition as authorities on the subject of linguistic disparagement of women with ''One Small Step for Genkind,'' a 1972 article in The New York Times Magazine that was reprinted in college textbooks as recently as last year.         In it, they wrote: ''Except for words that refer to females by definition (mother, actress, Congresswoman), and words for occupations traditionally held by females (nurse, secretary, prostitute), the English language defines everyone as male. The hypothetical person (''If a man can walk 10 miles in two hours . . . ), the average person (''the man in the street'') and the active person (''the man on the move'') are male. The assumption is that unless otherwise identified, people in general -- including doctors and beggars -- are men.         ''It is a semantic mechanism that operates to keep women invisible; man and mankind represent everyone; he in generalized use refers to either sex; the ''land where our fathers died'' is also the land of our mothers -- although they go unsung. As the beetle-browed and mustachioed man in a Steig cartoon says to his two male drinking companions, 'When I speak of mankind, one thing I don't mean is womankind.' ''         Ms. Swift said yesterday that the idea for the article grew out of their first collaboration as editors in 1970, on a sex education handbook for high schools that talked about the nature of man and man's behavior and used the pronoun ''he'' in ways that made it impossible to know whether the author was writing about both males and females or only about males.         ''We began to think this was a field that needed to be written about and explored,'' Ms. Swift said.         Their articles on the subject first appeared in New York magazine and in the first issue of Ms. magazine. The New York Times Magazine article appeared on April 16, 1972, and  ''got an awful lot of negative comment,'' Ms. Swift said.         Casey Geddes Miller was born on Feb. 26, 1919, in Toledo, Ohio. She received a bachelor of arts degree in 1940 from Smith College, where she was a philosophy major. During World War II, she served for three years in the Navy, working in Washington in naval intelligence.         She was on the staff of Colonial Williamsburg from 1947 to 1954, when she became the curriculum editor of the publishing house of the Episcopal Church, Seabury Press. Ten years later, she became a freelance editor, working at her home in Greenwich and after 1967 in East Haddam, where she formed her editorial partnership with Ms. Swift.         She is survived by her sisters, Kate R. Gregg of Falmouth, Me., and Caroline S. Cooper of Gilmanton, N.H.       
         Evelyn Payne Davis, a founder of the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women and a former vice president at the Children's Television Workshop, died on Friday at Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Davis had suffered from lung cancer for a year, said her son, David Payne.         As vice president of the Children's Television Workshop's Community Education Services, Mrs. Davis led efforts to make ''Sesame Street'' known to inner-city parents and children when the program began appearing in 1969.         At that time, before cable, ''Sesame Street'' and other public television shows were typically on hard-to-find UHF channels, Joan Ganz Cooney, a Children's Television Workshop founder, said yesterday.         Because these channels attracted few viewers in poor, urban and rural areas, Mrs. Davis oversaw employees who visited these communities and explained that ''Sesame Street'' was an innovative television experiment that would teach preschoolers about numbers and the alphabet, a sort of televised version of the Head Start program, Ms. Cooney said.         Three years after the program started, surveys showed that the efforts to reach these children had succeeded, Ms. Cooney added.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Davis also helped found the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women, which urged black women to become involved in politics and community affairs. In 1972, she served as its first president.         The coalition's projects included helping young black women establish personal networks and holding voter registration drives on 125th Street in Harlem, said Mary Burke Washington, a co-founder of the coalition and a former chairwoman of the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board.         Born in New Orleans on Dec. 27, 1921, the former Evelyn Aramburo and her family moved to New York when she was a child. She grew up in Harlem, graduated from Hunter High School and attended Hunter College. In the 1960's, she worked in antipoverty programs and also became involved in the New York Urban League.         She was married to Mynor Payne, an electrical engineer, for two decades. He died in 1968. Later, she married Charles Davis.         Working with the Children's Television Workshop, where she served as a consultant after retiring in 1992, Mrs. Davis also helped open scores of children's centers in prisons. The centers offered programs to help prison inmates form better relationships with their visiting children, in part through ''Sesame Street'' and educational games.         ''It's not fair to say to a child, 'Your mother can't hold you,' '' Mrs. Davis said in 1986. ''Kids deserve to see their parents in a setting that doesn't scare them.''         Mrs. Washington, who lived down the hall from Mrs. Davis in a Gramercy Park building for 26 years, said Mrs. Davis was also known to friends for her talents as an entertainer. She played the piano and sang, imitating Billie Holiday. Mrs. Davis could also  play an improvised bass fiddle -- a broom tied to an overturned old-fashioned washtub, Mrs. Washington recalled.         In addition to her son, who lives in New Town, Conn., she is survived by a stepdaughter, Liberty Davis Rashad of Cambridge, Mass., and two granddaughters.       
         Lea M. Kisselgoff, a Sinologist who specialized in classical Chinese texts, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         Mrs. Kisselgoff studied classical Chinese at the School of Oriental Languages in Paris and received a degree in Chinese civilization from the Sorbonne. She studied there with the pioneering Sinologists Marcel Granet and Paul Pelliot and was Professor Granet's research assistant in the 1930's.         She also did graduate work at Columbia University after coming to the United States in 1941. In January 1942 she joined the staff of the Chinese History Project, sponsored by the University of Washington and Columbia.         The project published ''History of Chinese Society, Liao (907-1125),'' a study of the Liao dynasty. The Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies in 1950 called the volume ''a monumental work.''         Mrs. Kisselgoff served as president in 1972-74 and 1982-84 of the New York Oriental Club.         Her husband, Avram, chief economist of the Allied Corporation, died in 1983. She is survived by her daughter, Anna, chief dance critic of The New York Times.       
         Elizabeth Rudel Gatov, a wealthy California businesswoman who was long active in Democratic politics and served briefly as Treasurer of the United States, died on Jan. 25 at her home in Kentfield, Calif., near San Francisco. She was 85.         Mrs. Gatov was Elizabeth Rudel Smith -- she had just divorced Frederick H. Smith, a San Francisco businessman when, as a Democratic national committeewoman from California, she was appointed Treasurer in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.         She resigned in April 1962 to return to California politics and helped fellow Democrats that year thwart Richard M. Nixon's initial bid for a political comeback, in the race for governor. She also rejoined the Democratic National Committee, where she remained until 1965.         Mrs. Gatov was born in Montreal, the daughter of a Canadian-American industrialist. She attended Smith College and graduated in 1937 from the University of Michigan.         She was married four times and widowed three times. Her last husband, Albert W. Gatov, a California businessman and former Government official, died in 1978.         She is survived by a daughter, Jane Jackson of Oakland, Calif.; a son, Daniel Smith of Kentfield; four granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.       
         Dorothy Fosdick, the foreign policy expert who helped fashion the United Nations, the Marshall Plan and NATO in the 1940's, advised Adlai E. Stevenson in the 1952 Presidential campaign and then spent nearly three decades as Senator Henry M. Jackson's chief cold war strategist, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Washington. She was 83 and had continued to live in Washington after Senator Jackson's death in 1983.         Her sister, Elinor Downs, said the cause was cardiac arrest.         From the early months of World War II, when the United States began  planning for the postwar world, until President Reagan opened the final phase of the struggle against the Soviet Union with his ''evil empire'' speech in 1983, Dr. Fosdick was in the thick of national foreign policy planning and debate.         Along the way, she consistently took such a hard line against the Soviet Union and was such a passionate and articulate advocate of military might that her colleagues sometimes had to remind themselves that she was, in fact, the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, the pacifist pastor of Riverside Church, the Rockefeller-backed bastion of New York liberalism.         Whatever her father's influence,  Dr. Fosdick, who was born in Montclair, N.J., and grew up in the faculty housing at the Union Theological Seminary, took as her mentor the family's friend and neighbor, Reinhold Niebuhr, the theologian whose belief that evil is a palpable world force that must be resisted and overcome became the geopolitical creed of a generation of cold war theorists.         Dr. Fosdick's career was also influenced by her beloved Uncle Raymond, her father's brother, Raymond B. Fosdick, an international lawyer whose appointment as Under Secretary of the League of Nations came to naught after the Senate failed to ratify the founding treaty.         She took the rejection of the treaty as a personal affront and later wrote a prize-winning essay on the episode at the Horace Mann School, then went off to Smith College, where she was an acclaimed athlete. After obtaining a doctorate in public law from Columbia University, she taught sociology and political theory.         Her academic career came to an end early in 1942, when she was recruited by the State Department's opaquely named Division of Special Research and was assigned to begin planning for a postwar international organization.         Over the next few years, she helped shape the Dumbartron Oaks and San Francisco conferences, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, served on the delegations to both conferences and attended the early sessions of the U.N.         Her contributions were so impressive that in 1948 at the age of 34, she became the only woman on the State Department's newly formed Policy Planning Staff, a high-level, in-house think tank of nine strategic planners whose work under George Kennan and later Paul Nitze helped shape the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.         During the 1952 Presidential campaign, Dr. Fosdick became so enamored with the Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, that she became his chief foreign policy adviser and had a romantic fling with him (at the same time, she later learned, that Stevenson was having a secret affair with Alicia Patterson.)         Stevenson apparently disappointed her on both fronts. Dr. Fosdick, who never married, mainly, her sister suggested, because she never found a man her equal, later confided to friends that she did not think Stevenson had the gumption to be President.         After a period as a freelance writer, Dr. Fosdick, whose books included, ''What is Liberty?'' and ''Common Sense and World Affairs,'' finally found her niche in 1954 as chief foreign policy adviser to Senator Jackson, the Washington State Democrat known for his expertise in military affairs.         Sharing both his passion for liberal social causes and his commitment to a strong military, Dr. Fosdick became the Senator's alter ego. She wrote his speeches, helped develop his strategic positions and political initiatives and orchestrated his legendary informational hearings. Her 1961 report, for example, after a quiet, thorough investigation of cold war policy procedures became the blueprint for President John F. Kennedy's reorganization of the national security policy apparatus.         At a time when Senator Jackson was a Senate legend for the quality of his staff, Dr. Fosdick was in command of the ''bunker,'' so called partly because of the cramped staff quarters and partly because Senator Jackson and his staff were so often at odds with the prevailing political winds of detente.         Dr. Fosdick, known as Dickie and sometimes referred to as the bunker's bubbie, the Yiddish word for grandmother, was an exacting boss, one whose day could be ruined by a misplaced comma.         A slim, peppery woman who had been a fierce competitor on the Horace Mann and Smith athletic fields, Dr. Fosdick was only 5-foot-1, but more than one bulky senator felt her sting. When Dr. Fosdick went toe-to-toe, eyeball-to-tie clasp on a cherished issue, she would punctuate her arguments with rapid finger gestures that often peppered a senatorial paunch.         In time, Dr. Fosdick was eclipsed on the public stage by some of her  admiring young proteges, among them Ricard N. Perle, who became an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Elliott Abrams, who became an Assistant Secretary of State, but only, perhaps, because she preferred to work behind the scenes.         As Mrs. Downs put it, recalling that her sister had turned down repeated offers to become an ambassador or college president: ''She had no personal ambition. She only wanted to save the world.''         In addition to Mrs. Downs, of Boston, Dr. Fosdick is survived by a niece, Patricia Berger of Brookline, Mass., a nephew, Stephen Downs of Albany; two grand-nephews, and three grand-nieces.       
         Harriet Pratt Morris, a leader in the movement against the death penalty in Georgia and nationwide, died on Sunday at her home in Atlanta. Mrs. Morris, who was known as Patsy, was 66.         Her husband, the Rev. John B. Morris, said she died of lung cancer.         For some 20 years, first with the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia and after 1987 at the Georgia Appellate Practice and Educational Research Center in Atlanta, Mrs. Morris worked to find legal representation for death row inmates.         She was among the first to document that the likelihood of receiving the death penalty for a murder conviction depended in large part on the race and social status of the victim and the county where the crime took place.         Mrs. Morris's efforts not only earned the gratitude of prisoners spared capital punishment, but also inspired many lawyers to devote their practices to opposing the death penalty. Her work served as a model for those outside the courts as well.         ''Both of us are enormously and extremely opposed to the state killing people,'' Mr. Morris said yesterday. ''We don't believe that the death penalty acts as a deterrent.         Mrs. Morris honed her social conscience in the turbulent South of the 1950's and 60's, during the early days of school desegregation and of passive civil rights protests that were often met by violence.         ''My views on capital punishment have been shaped by my life,'' she  once wrote.         When the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to be reinstated in 1976, Mrs. Morris began to monitor prisoners under sentence of death, trying to find counsel for them. Good-natured but firm, she pressed lawyers in Georgia and elsewhere to accept these cases without fee.         Mrs. Morris was a great-granddaughter of Charles Pratt, a co-founder of Standard Oil and a founder of the Pratt Institute. A daughter of H. Irving Pratt and Ellen H. Pratt, she was born in Manhattan and reared in Glen Cove and Oyster Bay, L.I.         Mrs. Morris graduated from Vassar College, where she studied childhood education, in 1952. Later that year, she married Mr. Morris.         The couple moved to the Deep South in 1954, when Mr. Morris was appointed a vicar in Dillon, S.C.         At the end of 1958, they moved to Atlanta, where Mr. Morris became the executive director of the newly formed Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity, a group that supported the civil rights movement and addressed segregation within the Episcopal Church.         Later, the couple helped found the Georgia chapter of the A.C.L.U.         In addition to her husband and her mother, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Pratt is survived by two daughters, Anne B. Morris of Southampton, Mass., and Ellen Morris McCann of Lincoln, Mass.; two sons, Christopher W. Morris of Haverford, Pa., and John B. Morris Jr. of Washington; two sisters, Margaret Cardoza of Brookline, Mass., and Ellen Stoia of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Lenore Hershey, a former editor of McCall's magazine and The Ladies' Home Journal, died Thursday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old and a resident of Riverdale, the Bronx. Her daughter, Jane Cuozzo, said the cause of death was complications from Parkinson's disease.         Mrs. Hershey, a graduate of Hunter College, began her career in the promotion department of The New York Herald Tribune and moved to McCall's in 1952. She was executive editor when she left in 1968 to become managing editor of The Ladies' Home Journal. She was appointed editor in 1973, three years after feminists had staged a daylong sit-in demanding that a woman be named editor. In 1981, Mrs. Hershey was named president and editorial director of a new multimedia subsidiary of The Journal's parent company, the Charter Publishing Company.         Mrs. Hershey's seminars on the role of women in the economy led to the creation in 1972 of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Economic Role of Women, on which she served.         Her husband, Dr. Solomon G. Hershey, a professor of anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died in 1992. She is survived by her daughter, Jane Cuozzo of Manhattan.       
         Leanne Katz, who served as executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship since its creation more than 20 years ago, died at her New York home Sunday, after a three-year battle with cancer. She was 65.         As a defender of free speech, Ms. Katz worked with teachers, librarians and authors across the country to fight the banning of books, magazines, movies and art.         Ms. Katz worked on dozens of cases each year in which principals or school boards had removed books from classrooms or libraries because they disapproved of the content. Among the authors whose works Ms. Katz defended -- sometimes repeatedly -- are Judy Blume, Maurice Sendak, Nancy Friday, V. C. Andrews, Katherine Paterson, Ken Follett, Madeleine L'Engle, Chris Durang, Dorothy Allison and Robert Cormier -- in addition to Mark Twain and Geoffrey Chaucer.         Ms. Blume, a popular children's author whose books dealing frankly with adolescent sexuality have frequently been the targets of censorship, said: ''When my books were being banned early on, in the 80's, I had nowhere to go, until I found this remarkable woman, this tiny dynamo who had such passion and energy for fighting censorship. From then on, if I had word from a teacher, a librarian, or a newspaper anywhere in the country that something was being banned, all I had to do was put this person in touch with Leanne, and I knew she would instantly respond and get them through this, let them know they were not alone. She believed in the First Amendment above all.''         Recently, Ms. Blume said, Ms. Katz had been distressed about what seemed to be an increasing tendency not just to remove controversial books from use, but to dismiss the teacher or librarian who chose them.         The coalition Ms. Katz headed was created in 1974, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Miller v. California, which broadened the reach of censorship, allowing the banning of any work that lacked ''serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.''         The coalition is an alliance of 45 religious, artistic, educational and civil liberties groups ranging from Actors' Equity to the American Library Association and the National Council of the Churches of Christ, and it began as a project of the American Civil Liberties Union, but soon became a separate entity.         The coalition acted as an advocate against proposed legislation, national or local, that would restrict free speech. Roz Udow, the coalition's director of education and public affairs, said it worked on more than a hundred individual cases a year, most of them involving efforts to ban works because their content is considered sexual, profane -- as is becoming increasingly common -- a reference to Satan.         ''There isn't a book in the library that somebody hasn't tried to censor,'' Ms. Udow said. ''There have always been a lot of cases about sexual content, and currently the major topics of concern seem to be homosexuality, witchcraft and the occult.''         Throughout the 1990's, Ms. Katz has been a central figure in the debate over whether pornography harms women. Some feminists, including Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, believe that pornography is inextricably connected to discrimination and violence against women, but Ms. Katz organized other leading feminists to argue that free expression about sexuality is a feminist value and that censorship has harmed women in the past by suppressing information about sexuality and birth control.         Before she began working with the censorship coalition, Ms. Katz was on the national staff of the American Civil Liberties Union, as liaison to the group's affiliates. Ms. Katz served as a consultant for Human Rights Watch, the National Council of Teachers of English and the Modern Language Association. She taught courses on free expression at Queens College of the City University of New York and the New School of Social Research, and wrote and lectured widely on freedom of expression.         She is survived by her husband, Alvin M. Katz, her sons, Joseph and Jamie, and her sister Sara Blackburn.         A memorial service will be held at a date to be announced.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Evelyn Sharp, a New York businesswoman, investor and philanthropist and the head of a hotelier family that owned and managed some of the country's best-known properties, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 94 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         A native of Manhattan, she was attending the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1923 when she married Jesse Sharp, an up-and-coming developer and expert in real estate finance.         Besides keeping up with his ambitious undertakings, she made a name for herself as an interior designer. Among her clients in the 1920's were the Shubert theater chain and her husband's diverse building clients.         By the time he died in 1941, Mr. Sharp had built and owned large apartment houses and a string of fashionable Manhattan hotels, notably the Stanhope, on Fifth Avenue  opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Sharp took charge of the business, selling and buying her own rich portfolio of properties by 1955.         Early on, she sold 14 hotels left by her husband, keeping only the Stanhope, because, she said, ''We built it together, and we raised it like a pet.'' She added the Gotham, the Saranac Inn in Saranac Lake, N.Y., the Beverly Wilshire in Los Angeles and other properties, which she owned and managed.         At one time or another, the Sharp family also had stakes in Delmonico's, the Ritz Tower, the Carlyle, the Beaux Arts and the Paramount Building in Manhattan, and the St. Francis in San Francisco.         Mrs. Sharp took pride in offering gracious service in the European manner. She eventually divested most of her real estate holdings, including the Stanhope, and devoted herself to charities in New York and Los Angeles and to her art collection.         A fancier of School of Paris paintings and sculpture, she exhibited her collection at the Guggenheim Museum in 1978. Later she and her son, Peter Jay Sharp, a developer and owner of the Carlyle, donated the Sharp Gallery in the Metropolitan's 20th-century wing. (He died five years ago.)         In 1952, she endowed the Evelyn Sharp Foundation, which benefits the arts. In 1994, it listed almost $6.3 million in assets as well as grants totaling nearly $300,000, supporting music, dance, the fine and performing arts, museums and art and music education, primarily in New York.         Mrs. Sharp was a 50-year supporter and former board member of Planned Parenthood of New York City, and she helped establish its adolescent services program and Central Harlem Center. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan., for which she built the Sharp House for outpatients. She gave the Evelyn Sharp Laboratory for Nuclear Medicine to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.         She served on the boards of the Lexington Center for the Deaf and of the Associates of the California Institute of Technology. She endowed a graduate fellowship in behavioral biology at the institute and was a founder of the Los Angeles Music Center.         Mrs. Sharp was co-chairman of the Martha Graham Dance Company from 1979 to 1985. She also was a past chairman of La Maison Francaise at New York University.         Mrs. Sharp is survived by a daughter, Mary Sharp Cronson of Manhattan, now the president of the foundation; four grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Eugenie M. Anderson, who in 1949 became the first woman appointed a United States Ambassador, died on Monday at her home in Red Wing, Minn. She was 87.         Mrs. Anderson had been active in the Democratic Party on the state and national levels when she was appointed Ambassador to Denmark  by President Truman.         Her interest in international affairs had been stirred by a trip to Europe in 1937, where in Germany she first saw a ''totalitarian state in action,'' as she recalled.         On her return she spoke frequently on foreign affairs on behalf of the League of Women Voters at a time when much of the Middle West was strongly committed to isolationist policies.         She joined the Democratic Party in part to oppose Republican isolationists in her election district and worked with Hubert H. Humphrey in the successful effort to eliminate a Communist faction within the Minnesota party. That effort culminated in the Democratic-Farmer Labor Party fusion in 1944.         She took part in the establishment of Americans for Democratic Action, formed by the party's anti-Communist liberal wing in 1947. She was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948, a National Committeewoman, and a campaigner for the re-election of President Truman.         ''She was a prime force in moving along a good Democratic Party,'' said Orville Freeman, the former Minnesota Governor.         After her service in Denmark, President Kennedy appointed her in 1962 to head the American legation in Bulgaria, which was then a Communist ally of the Soviet Union.         The Government of Prime Minister Todor Zhivkov repeatedly made life uncomfortable for her mission, to the point of organizing a rock-throwing demonstration against the legation.         When the Bulgarian police tried to prevent her aides from passing out literature at the American display in the annual Plovdiv fair, Mrs. Anderson grabbed a handful of leaflets and distributed them herself.         She retired from the post as Ambassador in 1964.         President Johnson appointed Mrs. Anderson to represent the United States on the United Nations Trusteeship Council and a year later she served on the United Nations Committee for Decolonization.         Helen Eugenie Moore was born on May 26, 1909, in Adair, Iowa, one of five children of Rev. Ezekial A. Moore, a Methodist minister, and his wife, FloraBelle.         She concentrated in music as a student, and attended the Julliard School in New York; her original hope was to become a concert pianist.         She is survived by her husband of 67 years, John Pierce Anderson, an artist; a son, Dr. Hans P. Anderson of LaCrosse, Wis.; a daughter, Johanna A. Ghei of Madison, Wis.; six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Helene-Diane Shulman Kravis Ruger, an interior designer known professionally as Hedi Kravis, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Ms. Kravis, who maintained homes in Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y., was 49.         The cause was cancer, her son, Robert S. Kravis, said.         With her friend Elissa Cullman, known as Ellie, Ms. Kravis was a founding partner in 1984 of the Manhattan decorating firm of Cullman & Kravis.         They were among a new breed of interior designer -- young, chic, energetic and enterprising -- who were part of the society they designed for.         Their natural habitats were the Upper East Side and summer homes in the country. And instead of serving long apprenticeships with well-known decorators or taking courses in interior design, these women began by decorating their own apartments, their husbands' offices and their friends' country retreats.         For their clients, they enhanced the kind of settings they knew well -- spacious living rooms for parties, paneled libraries for leisure, tables hospitable to guests numbered in the dozens and richly canopied beds for slumber.         ''If you can really organize a household, you can do anything,'' Ms. Kravis said in an interview in 1987.         For one assignment, Ms. Kravis and her clients donned sunglasses and sun hats in the first week in January to imagine what summer would be like at a sprawling stucco and shingle house of 8,500 square feet on a site overlooking the Atlantic in East Hampton, L.I., where she had only six months to effect a transformation.         ''We imagined the landscaping and the not-yet-built tennis court,'' Ms. Kravis said, ''and thought what it might be like to walk through the house and out to play tennis.''         In 1987, Mrs. Cullman traced the origins of the firm to a movie script that she and Ms. Kravis showed to Stanley Jaffe, a film producer and old friend. ''His reaction was that we were talented, but could we help him refurbish his house in the country and pull his different homes together?'' she said. ''We were obsessive. We went down to the last details -- matchbook covers and guest towels.''         Both women married young, bore children, traveled, entertained, served on the boards of charities and collected antique English furniture, Chinese porcelain, American folk paintings and modern art.         Ms. Kravis, whose father, Bernard Shulman, was a psychiatrist, was born and reared in Brooklyn. She graduated from Finch College in 1969 and studied English at Columbia University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         She was a member of the board of the Irvington Institute for Medical Research and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. She also worked on behalf of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the American Jewish Committee.         Her marriage to Henry Kravis, the leveraged-buyout specialist, ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to J. Thompson Ruger, an executive of Sturm, Ruger & Company, manufacturers of firearms, was ended by his death in 1993.         In addition to her son, Ms. Kravis is survived by a daughter, Kimberly R. Kravis, and a sister, Sharon Beckerman, all of Manhattan.       
         Rebecca Shulman, who devoted a lifetime to Jewish and Israeli causes, most of all through Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 100.         She served three terms as national president of the large volunteer agency, from 1953 to 1956. She also held virtually every other major office in Hadassah, which was founded in 1912 and grew into the world's largest Zionist organization. She became active in it in 1929.         A trained nurse, she took particular interest in the medical aspects of Hadassah's work. She was a past chairman of the building fund for the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center and chairman of the Hadassah Medical Organization, one of the Mideast's largest medical care and research institutions.         The Hadassah Medical Organization comprises, besides Hadassah-Hebrew University Center, the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem and 10 other medical school, institutes and health care centers.         Mrs. Shulman became a nurturing presence in Israel from its birth.         In 1945, as chairman of Hadassah's national convention, she called on its 150,000 members to take up the struggle for Jewish statehood. In the next year, she visited Palestine to assess Hadassah's services amid a flood refugees from Europe.         In 1947, she helped David Ben-Gurion, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, break ground for a new Hadassah hospital building on Mount Scopus. She was there when the State of Israel was proclaimed, and her elder son, the late Paul Shulman, helped establish the Israeli Navy.         As national board chairman, she stayed in Israel to mesh Hadassah's medical and child-care centers of Palestine with the public health and sanitation programs being charted by the new state. She also remained there to serve as liaison between Hadassah members in Israel and the United States.         On a visit in Israel in 1967, she was about to leave when war broke out. She stayed on in Jerusalem to marshal Hadassah's resources and, the Six-Day War over, joined the first group to visit Mount Scopus after its capture by Israeli troops.         Rebecca Beldner was born in Vienna and brought to New York as a little girl. She graduated from Hunter College and its nursing school and started a career as a nurse and social worker. In 1918, she aided New York victims in the influenza epidemic.         In 1921, she married Herman Shulman, who became a prominent corporate lawyer and, like her, a strong supporter of Zionist causes.         Her husband died in 1945. She is survived by a son, Mark, of San Miguel Allende, Mexico, and seven grandchildren.       
         Mary Dewart Gleason, whose family owned The New York Sun from 1926 until 1950, died of liver failure yesterday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, her daughter, Laura Gleason Edgar, said. She was 81 and a longtime resident of Portland.         Mrs. Gleason's father, William T. Dewart, bought The Sun from the estate of Frank A. Munsey, and served as its president and publisher until his death in 1944.         In 1950 the family sold the newspaper to Scripps-Howard, which merged it to create The World-Telegram and Sun.         Born in New York City, Mrs. Gleason was the granddaughter of Thomas H. Wheeler, an early associate of John D. Rockefeller in the establishment of the Standard Oil Company.         A 1933 graduate of the Brearly School, Mrs. Gleason studied art in Italy after graduation. She was presented to New York society at a dinner-dance in December 1934.         Mrs. Gleason served on the board of the C. W. H. Merlis Corporation, a Dewart family holding company with interests in real estate and banking.         Mrs. Gleason is survived by her husband of 57 years, Frederick B. Gleason Jr.; a brother, Thomas W. Dewart of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Frederick B. Gleason 3d of Savannah, Ga.; a daughter, Laura Gleason Edgar of Riverside, Conn.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Sophia Wittenberg Mumford, the wife and sometime editor of the critic and historian Lewis Mumford,  died on April 22 at her home in Amenia, N.Y. She was 97.         At her death she was writing a book on her life and the work she undertook with her husband, who died in 1990.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mumford gave up a budding career as an editor of the literary periodical The Dial to help further her husband's literary and academic aspirations.         While running a household and raising two children, she served as a sounding board and occasional editor and adviser to a man who took neither advice nor editing easily.         She turned to social causes once again with the rise of Fascism in the 1930's and was active in a group that called for an early American declaration of war against the Axis powers. In 1944, the Mumfords' first-born, Geddes, was killed in action in Italy.         As Lewis Mumford grew more reclusive in old age, her tasks as an editor grew. The dedication of later editions of his autobiography, ''My Works and Days,'' read, ''To Sophia. Still the best of my Findings/The most enduring of my Keepings,'' an echo of his 1975 memoir, ''Findings and Keepings.''         Sophia Wittenberg, went to work after high school as a secretary and then became an editor at The Dial, where she met Lewis Mumford.         She remained his constant companion in his final years, when, she said, his mind was slipping but ''his essential characteristics'' remained. Studs Terkel devoted a chapter to her in his 1996 book ''Coming of Age.''         She is survived by a grandson, James Geddes Morss of Manhattan; a granddaughter, Elizabeth Mumford Morss of Kinderhook, N.Y., and a great-grandson. The Mumfords' daughter, Alison Mumford Morss, died in 1993.       
         Anna Scarpova Youskevitch, a prominent ballet teacher and a former member of the Ballets Russes troupes of the 1930's and 40's, died on Thursday at the Broadview Health Facility in West Hartford, Conn. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Maria Youskevitch.         Mrs. Youskevitch was the wife of Igor Youskevitch, one of this century's greatest male ballet dancers. Until his death in 1994, they often taught together. Earlier in their careers, they performed together in productions of ''Le Spectre de la Rose,'' Michel Fokine's ballet about a young woman who dreams that the spirit of a rose is dancing for her.         The daughter of a Russian mother and an Italian father, Mrs. Youskevitch, whose original name was Anna Scarpa, was born in Urbino, Italy. But following the balletic fashion of the time, she Russianized her surname. She studied ballet in Rome and Paris and toured Australia and Western Europe, from 1936 to '38, with a group directed by Leon Woizikovsky that served as the second company for the celebrated Ballets Russes directed by Col. W. de Basil.         She met Mr. Youskevitch during these tours. In 1938, the year they were married, they joined Leonide Massine's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She remained with it until 1944, danced on Broadway in the musical comedies ''Sadie Thompson'' (1944) and ''Marinka'' (1945) and then left the dance world to care for her daughter.         In later years, she taught at the Ballet Theater School, the Ballet Russe School, the New York Conservatory of Dance and other New York schools. At the time of her death, she was teaching at the Broadway Dance Center.         She is survived by her daughter, of Hartford, who is a rehearsal assistant for the Hartford Ballet.       
         Una E. Johnson, who built the print collection of the Brooklyn Museum of Art into one of the country's largest and best, died April 28 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Johnson, who was born in Dayton, Iowa, in 1905, was educated at the University of Chicago where she studied art history and literature, and at what is now called Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.         She worked at the Cleveland Museum of Art before going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1936 as assistant curator of prints and drawings under Carl O. Schniewind. In 1941 he retired and she was appointed curator, a position she held until her own retirement in 1969. She was named curator emeritus by the museum in 1973. In 1947 she organized the museum's first annual National Print Exhibition, and she supervised them until 1968.         Ms. Johnson wrote numerous books and catalogues including ''Georges Rouault and His Prints,'' ''20th-Century Master Drawings,'' ''American Prints and Printmakers,'' ''Isabel Bishop, Prints and Drawings: 1925-1964,'' ''Adja Yunkers: 1927-1967,'' ''The American Woodcut: 1670-1950'' and, most important, a monograph about the  French art dealer Ambroise Vollard that catalogued his activities as a publisher of prints and illustrated books. The monograph, originally published by Wittenborn & Schultz in 1944, was republished by the Museum of Modern Art in 1977.         Ms. Johnson also served for three years as director of the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y.       
         Florence M. Kelley, the first administrative judge of the modern Family Court in New York City and an advocate for the legal rights of the poor, died last Saturday at her home in Little Compton, R.I. She was 85.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, David S. Worgan, a retired executive assistant district attorney of New York County.         Judge Kelley presided over the notoriously overworked court during an era of great reform. In 1960, she became the first woman to be chief judge of what was then the Domestic Relations Court of New York City.         ''Florence and I went to Yale Law School together,'' said Mayor Robert F. Wagner when he appointed her. ''She's moved further than I -- and done much better.''         In 1962, when the court was reconfigured as the new Family Court of the State of New York, within the City of New York, with jurisdiction over a range of social problems, she became administrative judge.         A slim, gracious woman, Judge Kelley was ladylike in her manner but decisive and stubborn in her role as a visionary administrator. Then as now, the Family Court, regarded as the stepchild of the system, was criticized for its sprawling caseload. Judge Kelley pressed for more judges, psychiatric evaluations for clients and probation services for juveniles.         Her dedication to legal and social services for the poor was a family heritage: her grandmother, for whom she was named, was one of the first women lawyers in the country and the founder of the National Consumers League, an advocates' group for which Judge Kelley worked.         Born in Manhattan, Judge Kelley graduated from Smith College and Yale Law School.         In the 1930's and 40's, women prosecutors were a a rare sight in the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, where Judge Kelley worked under Thomas E. Dewey and Frank S. Hogan. She next turned to the private sector, spending a few years in a Wall Street law firm. But in 1947, she returned to public life as the attorney in charge of the criminal branch of the Legal Aid Society, where she spent 13 years.         She managed to maintain her sense of humor. Illustrating the heavy caseload of lawyers for the indigent, she told how she introduced herself to a new client in the city's detention pen by saying hesitantly, ''You're the man who robbed the delicatessen.''         He demurred. ''No ma'am,'' he said helpfully, ''I'm the one who pushed the woman out of the 13th-story window.''         In 1970, Judge Kelley became a trial judge of the Supreme Court of New York, serving until her retirement in 1980.         But retirement was a relative term for a woman who was also president of the Women's City Club and a member of foundations dedicated to the poor and the mentally ill. She and her husband moved to Little Compton, where she served on the town planning board and helped raise money for the Sakonnet Light House, which was relighted in March.         In addition to her husband of 44 years, her survivors include her brothers, Augustus M. Kelley and Nicholas Kelley Jr.       
         Marie Salant Neuberger, a New York foundation executive and philanthropist who was long active in civic affairs, died on Sunday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Peekskill, N.Y.         She suffered a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Neuberger, who took a special interest in the public schools, served several terms as president of the Women's City Club, an organization concerned with urban problems. It studies the quality of government, and life in the city in general, and makes recommendations for improvements.         She was chairwoman of the board of the Ethical Culture Schools for 13 years, having herself graduated from Fieldston, the Ethical Culture Society's preparatory school. She also served as a trustee of Bryn Mawr, her alma mater.         Her husband, Roy R. Neuberger, is a recognized collector of contemporary American artists like Jackson Pollack and Willem de Kooning, and she was active with him in various art institutions. These included the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         Another prominent beneficiary was the Neuberger Museum of Art, which they helped establish on the campus of the State University of New York at Purchase. Their art collection, deeded to that campus of the university, has been exhibited on loan at museums around this country and in Europe.         Born in Manhattan, Mrs. Neuberger majored in economics at Bryn Mawr on the advice of her father, Aaron B. Salant. After graduation in 1930, she went to work on Wall Street, where she met and married her husband, who became a successful investor and founded the investment management firm of Neuberger & Berman in 1939.         In addition to her husband of 65 years, Mrs. Neuberger is survived by their daughter, Ann N. Aceves of Santa Fe, N.M.; two sons, Roy S., of North Woodmere, N.Y., and James, of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as ''the Julia Child of horticulture'' for her common-sense if often loopy gardening programs on television in the 1960's, died on June 11 at Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass. She was 88 and lived in Marion, Mass.         Ms. Cruso, a witty, acerbic Englishwoman, wrote and starred in the weekly public-television program ''Making Things Grow'' from 1966 to 1969. In brisk, impeccable diction, she indoctrinated viewers into the mysterious world of cyclamen and spathiphyllum, enjoining them to tend their plants with loving kindness, and to throw them in the dustbin without a backward glance if the little ingrates failed to respond.         ''If a plant is unbelievably tatty, dispose of it without the least feeling of guilt,'' she told McCall's in 1971.         Trim and elegant, with dark bangs and a determined chin, Ms. Cruso possessed an uproarious wit, blunt candor and cultivated eccentricity.         ''Ha! There's the little brute,'' she once exclaimed as she flicked an invading slug onto her worktable. Cautioning squeamish viewers to avert their eyes, she raised a flowerpot on high. The pot came crashing down, and the slug was history. WGBH in Boston, which produced the program, was inundated with mail from delighted viewers.         ''Making Things Grow'' was aimed at the novice, and its appeal lay in Ms. Cruso's role as Everygardener, a true amateur who drew her advice from personal experience rather than formal horticultural training. ''I have never studied it, and there is so much I don't know,'' she once said. ''And I'm afraid I'll make some terrible mistake.''         Ms. Cruso did not merely handle plants: she communed with them as if they were sentient creatures, pinching them, patting them, sometimes dumping them unceremoniously onto the counter as dirt flew around the set.         In addition to her broadcasting career, which also included a household-advice program, ''Making Things Work,'' in the early 70's, Ms. Cruso wrote a gardening column for The Boston Globe for 22 years. She was the author of several books, including ''Making Things Grow'' (1969), ''Making Things Grow Outdoors'' (1971) and ''To Everything There Is a Season'' (1973).         She was born Jan. 7, 1909, in London, the daughter of Henry and Mildred Cruso. The name Thalassa, the Greek word for ''sea,'' was a whim of her mother's. According to family legend, a paternal ancestor, John Cruso, was a schoolmate of Daniel Defoe, who would later add an ''e'' to the surname and bestow it on his best-known literary hero. ''My mother's maiden name was Robinson,'' Ms Cruso once said in an interview, ''and I am told that the announcement of that engagement was the last thing that made Queen Victoria smile.''         The Crusos were passionate gardeners, and Thalassa fondly recalled childhood hours spent doing her homework in the greenhouse.         ''When we were given a holiday at school to do a project about our neighborhood, I made a collection of wild plants,'' she said in an interview. ''I bicycled miles to find them. And I found some rare ones.'' She added: ''I didn't win the prize because I presented them sloppily. The girl who won had a collection from her father's garden, neatly pressed. Mine were tied with a boot lace.''         Perhaps craving a way to muck about in the dirt and get paid for it, she went into archeology, receiving her diploma from the London School of Economics in 1931. She served as assistant keeper of the costume collection at the London Museum, and later directed an excavation at Bredon Hill, an Iron Age fort in Worcestershire. There she met the American archeologist Hugh O'Neill Hencken; they married in 1935, and she returned with him to Boston.         Mr. Hencken, who was for many years the curator of European archeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, died in 1981. Ms. Cruso is survived by her daughters, Ala Reid of York Harbor, Me., Sophia Stone of New Orleans and Thalassa Scholl of Boston; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         As a wife and mother in Boston, Ms. Cruso was hardly satisfied to confine her days to the garden-club circuit. The inspiration for ''Making Things Grow,'' she recalled, came on a visit to her brother in England: ''We would watch the BBC gardening programs and complain about how bad they were. And I had watched and admired Julia Child on TV, and suddenly I thought, 'I could do that with plants.' ''         She began with brief snippets tacked onto the end of longer programs. ''I used to pop on after the baseball game, or the symphony, or a very serious lecture on birth control,'' she said.         Ms. Cruso's work led to frequent appearances on the ''Tonight'' show, where she taught Johnny Carson how to compost eggshells in a closet. As a result of her celebrity, she became an unofficial custodian of the public horticultural trust. ''People stop me on the street,'' Ms. Cruso once said, ''and ask what to do with their African violets.''       
         Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious, a Chicago lawyer who held high posts in the Nixon and Bush Administrations, was active in the civil rights movement and was on the boards of major corporations, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 75.         The cause of death was breast cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a Republican, was known as Jewel S. Lafontant when she served in the Nixon and Bush Administrations. Prior to that, President Richard M. Nixon had appointed her to the Justice Department as Deputy Solicitor General -- the first woman and the first black person to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office.  She held that post from 1973 to 1975. Under President George Bush, from 1989 to 1993, she was in the State Department with the concurrent titles of ambassador-at-large and coordinator of refugee affairs.         In the civil rights field, she was a founding member of the Congress of Racial Equality, an officer of the Chicago chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. During the early 1940's, The Chicago Sun-Times reported yesterday, ''She brought change to the city by participating in sit-ins at Loop restaurants.'' In a 1991 interview, she recalled, ''Often we were spat upon and physically abused.''         Times changed, and from 1965 to 1967 she was on the President's Council on Minority Business Enterprise. In the early 1970's Ebony magazine named her one of the 100 most influential black Americans.         The corporate boards she was on over the years included those of the Mobil Corporation, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Trans World Airlines, Revlon, Inc., Harte-Hanks Communications, the Hanes Corporation and the Bendix Corporation         During her career, she was also a director of nonprofit institutions including Oberlin College, Howard University and Tuskegee Institute. And she received numerous awards and honorary degrees.         At her death she was a partner in the Chicago law firm of Holleb & Coff, which she joined in 1993. Her law practice, in her years there, was concentrated in the areas of corporate law, labor and employment law, and governmental and international relations.         Jewel Stradford was born in Chicago, the daughter of C. Francis Stradford -- a lawyer -- and Aida Arabella Cartera, and grew up there. She graduated in 1943 from Oberlin College and received a law degree in 1946 from the University of Chicago.         But afterward, The Sun-Times reported, she could not obtain office space, no major white law firm would employ her, and the Chigago Bar Association would not admit her as a member. In 1947, she went to work in the legal aid bureau of a charitable organization, before going on to work for a succession of Chicago law firms and doing much trial work.         During the Eisenhower Administration, from 1955 to 1958, she served as assistant United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1960, she seconded the nomination of Mr. Nixon as Republican candidate for President, but he was defeated by John F. Kennedy.         As the Bush Administration's coordinator for refugee affairs, she dealt with a staggering variety of problems. In 1989, when Moscow was permitting record numbers of Soviet Jews and Pentecostals to leave its soil, she declared that the Bush Adminstration wanted to ''get control over the flow'' of emigres. In 1990, she went to London and reaffirmed a Bush Administration pledge that the United States would help to settle half of all new Vietnamese boat people -- refugees who fled their country by sea and mostly went to camps in the British crown colony of Hong Kong.         In the same year, she went to the African nation of Malawi, which had been flooded with refugees from a civil war in neighboring Mozambique.         Her 1946 marriage to John Rogers ended in divorce in 1961. Later that year she married H. Ernest Lafontant, and he died in 1976.         She is survived by her husband of seven years, Naguib S. Mankarious; a son, John W. Rogers Jr. of Chicago, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  June 13, 1997, Friday         The obituary of Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious on June 3 referred incorrectly to a distinction she attained when she became Deputy Solicitor General of the United States in 1973. While she was the first woman to hold so high a position in the Solicitor General's office, she was not the highest-ranking black staff member. That was Thurgood Marshall, who became Solicitor General in 1965.       
         Madelon DeVoe Talley, an investment manager who was one of Wall Street's first female executives, died Friday in a car accident near Wyndam, N.Y., her husband, Truman M. Talley, said. She was 65.         Despite a longtime interest in finance, Mrs. Talley did not begin her career until 1969, when she was in her late 30's and in the midst of raising three children.         In his book ''The Go-Go Years,'' an account of Wall Street during the 1960's, the author John Brooks said Mrs. Talley was a ''New York housewife who had tired of full-time housewifery,'' when she took a job as an assistant analyst at the Dreyfus Corporation.         A year later, she was named co-manager of the Dreyfus Leverage Fund, a promotion that made her the first female fund manager on Wall Street.         During her tenure at Dreyfus, which lasted until 1977, Mrs. Talley managed several funds, was a member of the firm's executive committee and earned a reputation as one of the sharper financial minds around.         During that period she also received a B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College.         ''She had a lot of energy, talent and ability in the field, and did very well,'' said Howard Stein, the retired chairman of Dreyfus.         Mrs. Talley left Dreyfus to develop programs for the American Women's Economic Development Corporation, a joint venture of the Small Business Administration and the Commerce Department that aids women entrepreneurs.         Mrs. Talley said she took the job to hone her interest in small business rather than further an interest in business.         ''Everybody in my family has started his own business,'' she said in a 1979 interview.         ''My father-in-law started a paperback book company; my father started two businesses on Wall Street, and my grandfather started two businesses in Hoboken.''         The call of the investment world was strong, however, and seven months after taking on her new position Mrs. Talley returned to it.         In February 1979 she was appointed New York State's director of the division of investments and cash management, a job that included the management of the state's $16 billion common retirement fund.         ''Madelon Talley set the procedures and processes for the retirement funds, so that when the markets started to rise in 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 800, we were set,'' said Edward V. Regan, the former New York State Controller who hired her. ''It was a very, very major contribution.''         Mrs. Talley kept her Albany job until June 1982, when she left to join Rothschild Inc. as president of its asset management unit. She held the post for two years, leaving to set up a hedge investment fund for private investors.         In the last decade, Mrs. Talley devoted much of her time to writing about investing and serving on various boards.         From 1993 to 1995, she served as a governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers. In 1995, she was appointed a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She wrote two books and numerous articles for a variety of publications.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Talley was vice chairman of W. P. Carey & Company, a real estate concern, a member of Alliance Capital Management's International Advisory Committee and a member of the board of the Joffrey Ballet.         ''She knew our business as a customer and a vendor, and she did a great job for New York State by getting the state heavily into stocks in the early 1980's, which was the right thing to do,'' said Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital.         A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Talley was a 10th-generation New Yorker, her forebears having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine in the mid-17th century.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Talley is survived by a son, MacDonald W. Talley of Pacific Grove, Calif.; two daughters, Melanie Talley Whately and Marina Talley, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. of Sea Girt, N.J.       
         Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.         Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood.         The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as ''the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.''         The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.         Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler ''the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life.'' Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that ''her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come,'' particularly its cultural life.         Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.         She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.         During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.         When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.         ''She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done,'' said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. ''She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities.''         Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be ''tough, but not intractable,'' someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually ''usually got her way.''         Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.         ''She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles,'' said David Halberstam, whose book, ''The Powers That Be,'' chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. ''If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player.''         At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.         ''Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language,'' he said. ''It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them.''         Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.         In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.         She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.         Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.         One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.         ''I think of myself as a catalyst,'' she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. ''There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job.''       
         Mumeo Oku, a pioneer in Japan's consumer movement and an early campaigner for women's rights, died on Monday at her Tokyo home. She was 101.         Mrs. Oku founded the Housewives' Association, one of Japan's first and best-known consumer groups, and remained its leader for decades. She also was one of the first women to serve in Parliament.         ''She opened the way for consumers' movements and consumers' rights in Japan after the war,'' said Teiko Kihara, chairwoman of the Japan League of Women Voters.         The Housewives' Association grew out of a protest over the shoddy quality of matches being rationed by the government in the impoverished days just after World War II. Only one match in 10 would light.         The association went on to protest other poor-quality goods such as clothing that shrank too much and cans labeled beef that were really filled with horse meat or whale. In protest marches, members wore aprons over their kimonos and carried large rice ladles as placards.         Consumer groups, however, never became very powerful in Japan, a nation that sacrificed its consumers' life style to build its industry. The Housewives' Association, which now has 391 local chapters, has sometimes taken positions that seem anti-consumer, such as opposing the import of inexpensive rice in order to protect Japan's farmers.         Mrs. Oku was born in Fukui Prefecture in western Japan in 1895, the eldest daughter of a blacksmith.         She graduated from Japan Women's University and became active in 1920 in the women's suffrage movement. She also worked at a spinning company to become involved in the labor movement and was appalled by the working conditions. And she ran a home to help poor women and children from 1923 until it was destroyed in an American air raid in 1944.         Japanese women gained the right to vote and hold office in 1946, when the country was under United States occupation in the years after World War II. Mrs. Oku won a seat the next year in the upper house of Parliament and served for three six-year terms.         Mrs. Oku always wore a traditional Japanese kimono, joking that she could not afford Western clothes.         ''She always wore a kimono beautifully but her mind was tougher than men's,'' said Ms. Kihara. ''She was very clear in expressing her opinion even in front of men of high status. Very few women could do that in Japan at that time.''         Mrs. Oku is survived by a daughter, Kii Nakamura, who also served as a chairman of the Housewives' Association, and a son, Kyoichi Oku, both of Tokyo.         A funeral is to be held Thursday in Tokyo.       
         Mary Louise Smith, a representative of the Republican Party's moderate wing and the only woman ever to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee, died on Friday at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. She was 82 and a longtime resident of Des Moines.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son James E. Smith.         Mrs. Smith was chosen to be chairman of the Republican National Committee by Gerald Ford when he succeeded Richard M. Nixon as President in 1974.         She headed the party during the difficult period after Watergate and announced in November 1976 -- three weeks after President Ford was defeated for re-election by Jimmy Carter -- that she would step down in January 1977, instead of serving two more years.         When she made her decision known, she urged Republicans to avoid ''destructive division'' and ''a fatal lurch to either extreme of the political spectrum.''         Mrs. Smith evidently decided to step down when she did because she thought that the question of whether a moderate or a conservative was to succeed her should be resolved as soon as possible so that the party could begin getting ready for the 1978 Congressional and 1980 Presidential elections.         At the time, her party's conservative faction, associated with Ronald Reagan held the moderates responsible for President Ford's defeat. In January 1977, the Republican National Committee elected Bill Brock, a conservative former Senator from Tennessee, to succeed Mrs. Smith. After Mr. Reagan was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Smith to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. But in his second term, after she had been critical of Administration policies on civil rights, he refused to reappoint her.         Mrs. Smith, whose maiden name was Epperson, was born in the small Iowa town of Eddyville and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa. She became active and prominent in Republican politics and served on the Republican National Committee from 1964 to 1984. She also became a feminist and became known for supporting civil rights and abortion rights.         Her husband, Dr. Elmer Milton Smith, whom she married in 1934, died in 1980.         In addition to her son James, of Des Moines, she is survived by another son, Dr. Robert C., of East Lansing, Mich.; a daughter, Maggie of Jamestown, Calif.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Joanne Tree Winship, a former actress who played an active role in many New York City charity benefits, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 73 and lived in midtown Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her husband, Frederick Winship, said.         Mrs. Winship served for some years in the 1970's as the American chairwoman of Girls Town of Italy, an international organization based in Rome that cared for children who had been abandoned.         The organization's annual fund-raiser, which included a fashion show, featured several European designers who later became well known in this country, including Gianni Versace and Valentino.         She also played a leading role in organizing dinner dance benefits for the New York City Opera and the School of American Ballet. Her fund-raising efforts for the Museum of the City of New York's theater collection included such events as ''A Celebration of Jule Styne on Broadway'' in 1987.         She appeared in a number of movies as a child, including ''Mad About Music'' in 1938 and ''Cheers for Miss Bishop'' in 1941, as well as the Nancy Drew mystery series. While in her teens, she began a stage career under contract to J. J. Shubert.         Her television credits included ''Robert Montgomery Presents,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Broadway TV Theater,'' as well as the serialization of ''Junior Miss.''         A native of New York City, she was the daughter of John and Anna Tree of Lawrence, N.Y. In 1956, she married Alexis Thompson. Mr. Thompson died the next year. She married Mr. Winship in 1967.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, George Tannenbaum of Montgomery, Ala., and a sister, Ruth Deroux of San Diego.         Correction:  September 26, 1997, Friday         An obituary on Aug. 11 about Joanne Winship, who was active in many charity benefits in New York City, misstated the year of her marriage to Alexis Thompson. It was 1953, not 1956. The error was pointed out in a letter to The Times last week.       
         Jean Westwood, who was a leader of George McGovern's disastrous Democratic campaign for President in 1972 and was the first woman to be chairman of a major political party, died on Monday in American Fork Hospital in American Fork, Utah, where she had lived for the last two years. She was 73.         The cause was complications from a pituitary tumor, said her husband, Richard E. Westwood.         Mrs. Westwood was an enthusiastic supporter of Democratic candidates and Democratic causes. But her period of leadership came during a time of Republican victories. So the unenvious task of trying to put a brave face on the McGovern campaign fell to Mrs. Westwood, who became the chairman of the Democratic National Committee after Mr. McGovern won the Democratic nomination.         ''It is pompous nonsense for anyone to presume to predict the result of an election seven weeks hence,'' she said in September 1972 as Mr. McGovern badly trailed President Richard M. Nixon. ''And it is ridiculous for any observer to conclude now that the whole thing is decided and the campaign is all over.''         But the whole thing was decided and the campaign was all over. Mr. McGovern carried only the Democratic bastions of Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. He was not the only loser. Mrs. Westwood faced  her share of the blame for the rout and, three weeks after the election, found herself combating suggestions that she resign.         ''I will not quit,'' she declared. But by December, she was gone after just five months as party chairman, whose title she preferred over chairwoman (''It's not something I'm going to fret about,'' Mrs. Westwood said when she got the job.)         Mr. McGovern, reached today at his vacation home in Montana, remembered Mrs. Westwood as ''a person who combined a tough mind with a warm heart.'' As an example, he offered a description of how he reached the decision to drop Senator Thomas F. Eagleton as his Vice-Presidential running mate.         Mr. Eagleton had revealed that he was hospitalized for ''fatigue and nervous exhaustion'' three times and underwent electric shock treatments for depression, almost derailing an already stumbling Presidential campaign.         Mr. McGovern said: ''I was calling key people in the campaign to decide what to do, and I can remember almost her exact words. She said, 'It's painful for me to do anything that might hurt Senator Eagleton, but if his staying on the ticket endangers our election chances, that hurts all the millions of people we want to serve, so I think he should step down.' That showed her compassion and tough-mindedness.''         Mr. McGovern later settled on Sargent Shriver as a running mate.         In 1968, Mrs. Westwood worked for the Presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York and, after his assassination, turned to Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, another loser to Mr. Nixon.         In 1975, she helped lead the Presidential campaign of Terry Sanford, then the president of Duke University, and in 1985 she played a similar role for Bruce Babbitt. She lived in Arizona from 1976 to 1995 and served as an adviser to Mr. Babbitt when he was the Governor.         The success that eluded Mrs. Westwood in politics came to her in business. In their home state, Utah, she and her husband simultaneously ran businesses that raised minks, built apartments and installed swimming pools.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Westwood is survived by a son, Richard E. Westwood Jr., of Highland, Utah; a daughter, Beth Davies of American Fork; two brothers, John K. Miles of Provo, Utah, and David H. Miles of Orem, Utah; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Lucy Somerville Howorth, a lawyer who said her advocacy of women's rights was inspired by the campaign that won women the vote under the 19th Amendment, died on Aug. 23 at her home in Cleveland, Miss. She was 102.         Mrs. Howorth watched from a crowded Statehouse gallery in Nashville on Aug. 18, 1920, when Tennessee ratified nationwide women's suffrage, and as the 36th state to do so put the 19th Amendment into the Constitution.         A native Mississippian, Mrs. Howorth spent much of her life in the political arena, including a turn as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1932. She was known as Judge Lucy, a sobriquet that stuck after she was appointed a United States Commissioner -- or magistrate -- for the Southern Judicial District of Mississippi in 1927.         A few years later, she moved to Washington and held legal positions in Federal agencies where few women had gone before. She retired in 1954 as general counsel of the War Claims Commission and returned home to the practice of law.         She was a national officer in the American Association of University Women, played a pivotal role in ending the organization's practice of racial segregation in the 1940's and headed a task force on the status of women and their employment opportunities after World War II. As an association vice president in the 1950's, she traveled widely and gave speeches around the country.         Born in Greenville, Miss., she came from a long line of lawyers rooted in colonial America. As a child, she said, her mother took her to suffragist meetings and nurtured her daughter's independent spirit and her wish to become a lawyer, an aspiration hardly befitting a fine Southern lady then.         Her mother, Nellie Nugent Somerville, was the first woman to be elected to the Mississippi Legislature, and Lucy also served there for four years in the 1930's.         Lucy Somerville graduated from Randolph-Macon Woman's College in 1916 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and went on to study at Columbia University, where she attended political rallies and meetings and regularly visited settlement houses.         ''It was in New York City at that time,'' she recalled when Radcliffe College honored her in 1983 for a lifetime of achievements, ''that I learned to be a whole human being.''         Back home, she earned her law degree with highest honors at the University of Mississippi in 1922 and practiced law until her appointment as Judge Lucy five years later. She held positions on the legal staff in the Veterans Administration and was a director of the V.A. Employees Credit Union from 1937 to 1949, when she joined the War Claims Commission as associate general counsel.         After leaving the Government, she joined her husband, Joseph Marion Howorth, in practicing law again in Cleveland, Miss., until about 1980. Mr. Howorth died in 1982 after 54 years of marriage. There are no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Howorth was president of the Business and Professional Women's Club of Washington and often served as a mentor to women in government. President John F. Kennedy named Mrs. Howorth to a task force on Federal employment for his Commission on the Status of Women.       
         Dr. Barbara D. Munk, an expert in the psychiatry of adolescence who worked with mentally ill mothers and their vulnerable infant children, died on Sept. 12 at New York Hospital after a seven-year battle with cancer. She was 72 and lived in Manhattan.         Confronting one of society's darkest secrets, infanticide, Dr. Munk created a program for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation with a twofold objective: to help mentally ill mothers who were threatened with losing custody of their children, while protecting the infants and toddlers from neglect and abuse.         ''The child is the one who needs to be protected,'' Dr. Munk would often remind her staff of clinical social workers in the Parent-Infant Therapeutic Program at Gouverneur Hospital, an affiliate of the New York University School of Medicine and member of the Health and Hospitals Corporation.         Dr. Munk, who was director of child and adolescent psychiatry services at the hospital, would personally examine the children entrusted to her care, as well as their mothers, for signs of abuse, including marks on their bodies.         ''Traditional fragmented care for the individual parent and infant will not do,'' she wrote in a 1993 article for the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs. ''We need programs designed to provide a safety net for the parent with mental illness, the offspring at risk and the family under stress.''         Her program accepted referrals of pregnant women and parents with emotional and mental disturbances like postpartum depression, schizophrenia, severe anxiety and personality disorders and dual diagnosis with drug abuse. They would be welcomed together with their children, from birth through age 5, who were at risk of slow development, disturbances or disabilities.         Initially financed as a pilot project in 1986 by the New York State Office of Mental Health, Dr. Munk's program drew referrals from private and public agencies in all five boroughs of New York City.         She provided help for more than 1,000 poor and ethnically diverse mothers and their children. Nearly half the children were less than a year old.         One child, Owen Green, came to Dr. Munk's attention through the city's Child Welfare Administration when he was 7 months old. His parents were paranoid schizophrenics who fought constantly, she wrote in one of her case studies.         Placement in foster care was a real possibility for Owen, she said.  But her team of clinical social workers arranged for Owen and his mother to stay with Owen's grandmother, preserving Owen's caretaking environment and family connection, she said. While Mr. Green was separated from the family, Owen, his mother and grandmother received continuing treatment.         As a result, she said, Owen had a normal physical development, indicated a high intellectual potential and an endearing capacity to relate to others.         Dr. Munk, who was born in Berlin in 1925, studied at the Hamburg University School of Medicine and at the University of Neurology and Psychiatry in Hamburg. She completed her residency in Child Psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital in 1959.         She was a psychiatric consultant to the Brooklyn Juvenile Court, the Max Planck Institute in Munich and the New York Foundling Hospital and was a clinical associate professor and supervisor in child psychiatry at New York University Hospital.         She served on the board of the Puerto Rican Family Institute for more than 30 years and on the New York Council on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for eight years.         Dr. Munk is survived by two brothers, Dr. Peter Munk and Dr. Klaus Munk, and a sister, Dr. Rosemarie Hoffman, all of Berlin.       
         Gertrude S. Lookstein, who with her husband, Rabbi Joseph H. Lookstein, was a leader in the New York Orthodox community and active in a number of organizations, died on Sept. 9 at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 90.         Her maternal grandfather, Rabbi Moses Z. Margolies, was the leader of Congregation Kehilath Jeshrun in Manhattan. He was succeeded by her husband, who served also as president, then chancellor, of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel, until his death in 1979. Their son, Haskel, succeeded his father in the rabbinate in Kehilath Jeshrun.         Mrs. Lookstein was a national board member and New York chapter president of Amit Women. She was also involved in fund-raising for the Yeshiva University Women's Organization, the U.J.A. Federation and the Women's Branch of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Nathalie Friedman; three sisters, Nathalie Herman and Hilda Fischman of Manhattan and Sylvia Lipton of Los Angeles; a brother, Charles Schlang of Scottsdale, Ariz.; eight grandchildren, and 28 great-grandchildren.       
         Myra Tanner Weiss, an unlikely Trotskyist whose radical vision of an egalitarian, collectivist society led her to organize migrant farm workers, rail against racism, make two quixotic mayoral races in Los Angeles and run for Vice President of the United States three times on the Socialist Workers Party ticket, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Indio, Calif. She was 80.         At first glance, Mrs. Weiss would hardly seem the type to be attracted to Leon Trotsky's version of Marxism, and not simply because she cut a stylish figure in leftist circles -- a small, attractive woman who was always immaculately turned out, generally in a well-cut suit of lush material run up by her husband's tailoring family.         Mrs. Weiss, who was on the Socialist Workers Party's national ticket in 1952, 1956 and 1960, was the daughter of an unabashed capitalist, Myron Tanner, who managed an investment syndicate before becoming a top insurance salesman in Los Angeles. And her roots were in Salt Lake City, a decidedly conservative city whose politics, customs and thinking tended to reflect the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.         But by the time she joined the Socialist Workers Party while attending the University of Utah in 1935, her family had already distanced itself from the Mormon Church. Her grandfather, Joseph Marion Tanner, an educator who was president of Utah State University, became so distraught when the church discontinued its doctrine of polygamy in 1890, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling that polygamy was not a permissible exercise of religious freedom, that he abandoned his six wives and fled to Canada.         Almost from the beginning, Mrs. Weiss was in the forefront of the socialist movement. Dropping out of college to follow her family to California, she took courses at the University of California at Los Angeles, but she soon left college, first to organize agriculture and cannery workers and later to help establish the Socialist Workers Party in Los Angeles, where she and another party organizer, Murry Weiss, began a romance that led to marriage.         After running for mayor of Los Angeles in 1945 and again in 1949, Mrs. Weiss and her husband came to New York, where he served as editor and she as a staff writer for the party's newspaper, The Militant.         A fiery speaker, Mrs. Weiss was chosen in 1952 as the running mate of the party's Presidential candidate, Farrell Dobbs, a onetime truck driver who had virtually created the teamsters' union as a national force before becoming a Socialist Workers official. But in three Presidential campaigns, party records show, the Dobbs-Weiss ticket polled a total of only 10,381 votes in 7 states in 1952, 7,799 votes in 4 states in 1956 and 40,328 votes in 12 states in 1960.         Partly because they believed that the party's democratic ideals were being overriden by oppressive bureaucratic controls, the Weisses withdrew in the 1960's, but Mrs. Weiss never abandoned her radical vision -- and paid a price for it.         In 1972, after receiving a degree in political science from New York University, she found she could not get a teaching job, and worked as a proofreader as a member of the International Typographical Union. In her later years, she championed feminism along with socialism.         Mrs. Weiss, whose husband died in 1981, is survived by two sisters, Shirley Nagel of La Quinta, Calif., and Martha Stinehart of Los Angeles, and two brothers, Norman Tanner of Salt Lake City and Dee Tanner of Pasadena, Calif.       
         Ann Dunnigan, an actress and translator, died on Sept. 5 at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Dunnigan was born in Hollywood and grew up in San Francisco. She attended Principia College in St. Louis. After a brief career in the theater, which included an appearance on Broadway in ''The Lord Blesses the Bishop'' in 1934, Ms. Dunnigan turned to teaching speech and then to translation. Her love for the writings of Chekhov led her to study Russian, after which she translated not only Chekhov but works by Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. Her Chekhov translations included ''Selected Stories'' (1960), ''The Major Plays (1964) and ''Ward Six and Other Stories''(1965). Tennessee Willilams based his play ''The Notebook of Trigorin'' on Ms. Dunnigan's translation of Chekhov's ''Seagull.''         Ms. Dunnigan also translated Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (1968) as well as Ilya Tolstoy's reminiscence, ''Tolstoy, My Father'' (1971), and Dostoyevsky's ''Netochka Nezvanova'' (1970). She also served as an editor of translations for the Journal of Soviet Studies during the 1960's.         In 1978 Ms. Dunnigan threatened to sue the playwright Jean-Claude van Itallie over his version of Chekhov's ''Cherry Orchard,'' which she said had been taken ''word for word'' from her own translation of the play. In an out-of-court settlement, the theatrical publisher Samuel French halted printing, sale and distribution of the van Itallie text. Another publisher, Grove Press, also agreed to withdraw its copies of the van Itallie version.         Ms. Dunnigan returned to the theater one final time, in 1982, when she appeared in a New York Shakespeare Festival production of ''Antigone'' at the Public Theater. She is survived by a son, John Stearns of Manhattan, and a brother, Richard Dunnigan of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Lotte Goslar, a dancer and mime known for her eccentric and whimsical comedy, died on Thursday at the Willowood Nursing Home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 90 and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         A short, roly-poly woman with a round, expressive face, Miss Goslar as a performer brought bugs, flowers and mushrooms vividly to life. She could portray a doting nanny and an obstreperous child with equal conviction.         In one of her most famous solos, ''Grandma Always Danced,'' she was seen, first, as a baby, then as a bride, a mother and an old woman. At any age, this character revealed her indomitability through her dancing and the sketch ended with her kicking up her heels as an angel in heaven.         As warm-hearted in person as she could be onstage, Miss Goslar was a popular teacher of mime and body movement for actors. She gave master classes at colleges and regional dance festivals across the country.  In the late 1940's, she taught in Los Angeles, where one of her pupils was Marilyn Monroe. They remained friends until the actress's death.         For all her gentle humor, Miss Goslar could castigate cruelty and indifference. The German playwright Bertolt Brecht devised the scenario for her ''Circus Scene,'' a depiction of a power struggle between a clown and a lion that can be interpreted as an allegorical attack upon authoritarianism. And Miss Goslar made her New York debut in 1937 in ''The Peppermill,'' an anti-fascist revue devised by Erika Mann, daughter of the novelist Thomas Mann.         Miss Goslar, who was born in Dresden, had first-hand knowledge of the choreographic and theatrical trends that made Germany artistically exciting during the 1920's. Influenced by many of them, she imitated none. Although she studied with Mary Wigman and Gret Palucca, the two most famous German modern dancers of the time, her primary interest became mime and she was inspired by Valeska Gert, a noted Berlin mime. But unlike Gert, who created scathing portraits of the dregs of society, Miss Goslar developed a gentle and more compassionate style.         Miss Goslar, who was not Jewish, despised Hitler and left Germany when the Nazis seized power. She remained in the United States after appearing with ''The Peppermill.'' For 10 years, beginning in 1943, she appeared in revues at the Turnabout Theater in Hollywood, sharing programs with Elsa Lanchester. She came to know Brecht, at that time living in California, and served as choreographer for the premiere in 1947 of his ''Galileo,'' which starred Charles Laughton.         Miss Goslar, who eventually settled on the East Coast, organized a company called Lotte Goslar's Pantomime Circus in 1954. It toured for decades, offering solo and group works for adults and children.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Katherine B. Oettinger, an authority on the care and upbringing of children, who was head of the Federal agency for the care of handicapped and underprivileged children, died on Monday in Carmel, Calif. She was 94.         Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957 as chief of the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Dr. Oettinger served four administrations. When the bureau was abolished in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her deputy assistant secretary for family planning and population. She retired from Government service in 1970 when the post was abolished in the Nixon Administration.         As an expert on retarded children, Dr. Oettinger expounded the view that such children could often be cared for in the home, and should be, though in an earlier time they were routinely sent to institutions. She was also intent on educating the nation about the difficult period of adjustment facing most parents of retarded children.         ''Some parents still blame themselves when they discover their child is retarded,'' she said, and then go from doctor to doctor looking for a ''cure,'' rather than counseling that will help them teach their children to learn to function with some degree of success.         Young parents, she said, particularly need help in evaluating whether the child can best be cared for at home, as 95 percent were by the 1960's, or in an institution. If the decision is the home, she said, careful parental training is needed in precise ways of giving consistent directions, for example, in using patterns of speech that the child can easily understand.         Dr. Oettinger received many awards and was called one of the nation's ''true heroines'' by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. After she left the Government, she traveled the world as a consultant on population control and family planning and wrote articles for social science journals and a well-received book, with Elizabeth C. Mooney, ''Not My Daughter: Facing Up to Adolescent Pregnancy'' (Prentice-Hall, 1979).         A native of Nyack, N.Y., she graduated from Smith College in 1925 with a degree in sociology and earned a master's degree in social work there.         Starting her career as a social worker in St. Paul, she moved to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, and then on to train nurses in the care of the handicapped in Scranton, Pa.         Her husband, Malcolm H. Oettinger, whom she married in 1930, died in 1963. She is survived by two sons, Malcolm Jr., of Chapel Hill, N.C., and John. B, of Los Angeles.         After her work in Scranton, she became director of community services in the Pennsylvania welfare department, working to improve mental health clinics and the training of welfare workers and ministers. She became the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University in 1954.         ''You'll never get rich as a social worker,'' she told her students. ''But the satisfaction comes from helping humanity -- it's a wonderful field.''       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Pilar Miro Romero, a pioneering female director of movies and television who also fostered Spain's film industry by introducing state aid for promising young filmmakers when she served in the Socialist Government of the 1980's, died at her home here on Sunday. She was 57.         She collapsed from a heart attack, doctors said. She had undergone surgery in 1975 to be outfitted with two heart valves, and they were replaced in a second operation in 1985.         King Juan Carlos, a friend of Ms. Miro's since they were law students in Madrid 40 years ago, paid condolences at the city morgue on Sunday. Just two weeks ago, she directed Spanish state television's coverage, beamed worldwide, of the wedding in Barcelona of the King's daughter Princess Cristina.         Ms. Miro's film ''Beltenebros,'' a tale of intrigue about the resistance during Franco's dictatorship, won a Silver Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1992. Her movie ''El Perro del Hortelano,'' an adaptation of a 17th-century Spanish comedy about palace romance, garnered seven prizes, including best director, at this year's Goya Awards, Spain's top film honors.         Ms. Miro, who became the first woman to direct dramas for Spanish television in 1966, was known for her link to progressive causes like the fight against racism. She won respect even from many leading conservatives, who attended her funeral today.         As the Culture Ministry director of cinema from 1982 to 1985, she began Government subsidies to cash-starved young filmmakers. Among the directors who acknowledged the benefit were Pedro Almodovar, nominated for an Oscar in 1989 for ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and Fernando Trueba, who won the foreign-film Oscar in 1994 for ''Belle Epoque.''         Born on April 20, 1940, in Madrid, Ms. Miro studied law at the University of Madrid but switched her interest to cinema and began working at state television in 1960. She directed her first feature-length film in 1975, and her 1979 movie ''El Crimen de Cuenca'' was censored for almost two years in Spain for depicting a torture scene by Civil Guards. When it finally opened, it was a top box office attraction.         In 1982, she was a media adviser to Felipe Gonzalez when he was elected for the first time as Prime Minister, starting nearly 14 years of Socialist Party rule. Ms. Miro served in his administration, first in the Culture Ministry, then as Director General of state television and radio. She resigned from that post in 1989 during a controversy over her spending some $30,000 in Government funds for her personal wardrobe. She paid back the money and was cleared of wrongdoing by a court in 1992.         Her subsequent projects included directing television coverage, in 1995, of the royal wedding in Seville of Princess Elena, the King's eldest daughter.         Mr. Gonzalez attended the funeral today, as did the Spanish tenor Placido Domingo, whom Ms. Miro had seen perform at the Royal Theater opera house in Madrid the night before she died. The large crowd also included Princess Cristina and her husband, making their first public appearance since their wedding, and NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, formerly a Socialist minister under Mr. Gonzalez.         Ms. Miro is survived by a son, Gonzalo, and a brother, Carlos.       
         Rosemary R. Gunning, who led fights against school busing in New York City in the 1960's and went on to become one of the first female Assembly members, died on Saturday night at the home of a niece in Roslyn, N.Y. She was 92.         The cause was liver cancer, said a grandniece, Patricia Gunning.         Ms. Gunning was known for her strong speaking style, clear arguments and intense community involvement as she became a founder of the state Conservative Party and the first woman to run for citywide office, in 1965, for City Council President on a ticket headed by William F. Buckley Jr. in the mayoral slot.         Beginning in 1968, she served four terms in the Assembly, becoming the first Conservative to win state office.         She was a leader in organizing Housing Court in New York and was an outspoken proponent of landlords' rights.         But she often took unexpected positions, favoring the proposed equal rights amendment as she opposed abortion. But Ms. Gunning became known as a leader of the fight against forced busing, a battle that she never defined in terms of race, but always as an issue of neighborhood control.         The effort thrust her to the forefront of one of the most tumultuous bitter battles in the city's history, with frequent picketing and racial epithets. Almost one-quarter of the students in the city stayed out of school one day in a protest that Ms. Gunning helped organize.         ''Integration is a fine thing,'' she said at the time. ''From the beginning, one of the things we wanted was to have no racial disputes, no lining of whites up against Negroes.''         However, she was not a parent. ''If I had children, I wouldn't have time for all this,'' she said.         In those battles, Ms. Gunning, who was shorter than 5 feet and often needed platforms to reach the microphones in front of her, became known as Grandma Gunning, for her middle-class appearance and sometimes stern demeanor.         It was her clarity of mind that most impressed Mr. Buckley, he said, adding, ''What was special about her was her facility in taking complicated matters and putting them in very clear negotiable form.''         But others described her as a dangerous force in 1964, particularly her urgings to keep children out of school as a protest. The president of the Board of Education, James Donovan, called that reprehensible, saying the move was a ''conspiracy to destroy'' public education.         Ms. Gunning's allies strenuously argue that time has vindicated her position. ''History has proven her right,'' Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party, said. ''Forced school busing ultimately ended up being a total failure in New York, ripping up neighborhood after neighborhood.''         Indeed, school busing was replaced by neighborhood control of schools and local school boards, a change that recently gave way to greater central control by the Board of Education.         Ms. Gunning was born in Brooklyn and moved to Queens at an early age. She entered the Brooklyn Law School directly from high school, one of the last students to do so. She was one of 10 women in a class of 600 and was admitted to the bar in 1930. After entering private practice, she later  worked 11 years as a private lawyer with the Army.         From her early youth until she died, she lived in the house in which her grandparents had lived, a white clapboard at 1867 Grove Street in Ridgewood, Queens. Her husband, Lester Moffett, had various jobs, including working as a guard at the 1964-65 World's Fair.         For all her accomplishments, people seem to remember her as the woman next door. Assemblyman Robert Werts, a Republican with whom she served, remembered an event at Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's estate to entertain legislators, recalling, ''I looked over, and she was hitting her husband over the head with a pocketbook to straighten him out.''         She worked as a private lawyer until she was 90, her grandniece said. She also continued to lobby on behalf of property owners, though she sometimes forgot to collect the $200-a-month rent that she charged a tenant for a room in her house. She also volunteered to help immigrants with  legal problems.         Surviving are a nephew, John, of Islip, N.Y.; 2 nieces, Marie and Ann, of Roslyn; 13 grandnieces and nephews, and a cousin, Sylvia Boyland of Fresh Meadows, Queens.       
         Jane Warner Dick, an early social welfare advocate who later served on a United Nations panel, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 91.         Mrs. Dick's social work began in 1926 with Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in 1889. A friend of Ms. Addams, Mrs. Dick volunteered in the Immigrants Protection League, an arm of Hull House that provided legal services and helped immigrants adjust to life in the United States.         She later served on the Illinois Social Welfare Foundation as well as the Illinois Board of Public Welfare, where she established volunteer services for the state's mentally ill.         Mrs. Dick was active in Democratic politics in Illinois, where she was an early supporter of Adlai Stevenson. She urged Mr. Stevenson to run for governor in 1948 and served as the state chairwoman of his successful gubernatorial campaign. She also worked on his Democratic Presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.         In 1961, Mrs. Dick was appointed as the United States representative to the Social Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council by President John F. Kennedy, on the recommendation of Mr. Stevenson, then Ambassador to the United Nations.         In her time with the United Nations, Mrs. Dick played a pivotal role in a raucous debate over a proposed resolution condemning racial discrimination. The United States maintained that the resolution, which called on nations to outlaw any organization that promoted discrimination, was too sweeping.         ''The United States' legal system does not permit censorship or punishment for the expression of ideas, even ideas we loathe,'' she said at the United Nations in 1963. ''We do not believe it is necessary to restrict freedom of thought in order to overcome discrimination.''         A version of the resolution was eventually adopted, with the United States and several Western nations abstaining from the vote.         Mrs. Dick was the author of a book about Mr. Stevenson, ''Volunteers and the Making of Presidents,'' published by Dodd, Mead Inc. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation, an advocacy group for the mentally ill; the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the Newberry Library in Chicago. She was also a governing member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.         Her husband, the Chicago industrialist Edison Dick, died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Titia Dick Ellis of Santa Fe, N.M.; a son, Edison W., of Washington; a sister, Marion Hodgkins of Lake Forest, Ill.; 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Lillian Rogers Parks, who surprised President William Howard Taft in his bedroom in 1909 and lived to tell that and many another juicy White House tale, died on Thursday at a hospital in Washington. She was 100 and the writer of ''My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House.''         The title of Mrs. Parks's 1961 memoirs, written with Frances Spatz Leighton, was somewhat misleading. For although Mrs. Parks worked as an observant White House seamstress and maid only from the beginning of the Hoover Administration in 1929 to the end of the Eisenhower years in 1961, she had been a familiar figure at the White House since she was a little girl.         That is because her mother, Maggie Rogers, who joined the White House staff on the fourth day of the Taft Administration, would often take her daughter to work with her. And when she did not, she would come home to regale her family with stories of what she had seen or heard at the White House that day.         Mrs. Rogers, a one-time society hairdresser who had used her client connections to get the White House job, eventually became the No. 1 White House maid and stayed on into the 1930's, dusting, cleaning -- and taking notes.         It was her insistence that her daughter complete the book she had long planned that helped induce Mrs. Parks to combine her mother's recollections with her own in what became ''Backstairs,'' and two other books written with Miss Leighton: ''It was Fun Working in the White House,'' a children's book, and ''The Roosevelts: A Family in Turmoil,'' published in 1973.         Mrs. Parks had also seen ''White House Chef,'' a book Miss Leighton had written with a former chef in the Eisenhower White House. Realizing she had far more White House anecdotes to tell, Mrs. Parks got in touch with Miss Leighton.         ''Backstairs,'' which became the basis of a nine-part NBC miniseries in 1979, created an immediate sensation when it was published in 1961. The book, which was on The New York Times best-seller list for 26 weeks, so alarmed the incoming First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, that she ordered all White House domestic employees to sign a pledge not to write about their White House experiences. (The task of collecting the signatures was given to Mrs. Kennedy's secretary, Mary Gallagher, who neglected to sign one, herself, and eventually wrote her own tell-all with Miss Leighton, ''My Boss,'' in 1969.)         For all the furor it created in the White House, the Parks book was comparatively tame, providing a wealth of charming and intimate gossip about the various First Families she served but no serious scandal.         By her own account, Mrs. Parks, who contracted polio when she was 6 and used a crutch the rest of her life, had a generally privileged existence in the White House, so much so that when members of the domestic staff were barred from using the White House elevator in World War II, so the crippled President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could be evacuated quickly in an emergency, the President, himself, ordered an exception for ''Little Lillian,'' the universal nickname for a woman who never grew above 4 foot 9.         Mrs. Parks, who was divorced, leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she generally found something nice to say about every President and First Lady she or her mother worked for, Mrs. Parks, who clearly considered Bess Truman her favorite First Lady, also greatly admired Eleanor Roosevelt.         Indeed, her own White House career might have ended with the Hoover Administration had it not been for a ringing declaration of domestic independence by Mrs. Roosevelt. As recounted in ''Backstairs,'' Mrs. Roosevelt, who had long chafed at living under the thumb of her imperious mother-in-law at Hyde Park, was not cowed when the senior Mrs. Roosevelt arrived at the White House in 1933 to help get her son settled and to take charge of the household.         But when the elder Mrs. Roosevelt criticized her daughter-in-law ''for using colored help instead of white help, as was the custom at Hyde Park,'' the First Lady put her foot down.         ''Mother,'' she said, according to the maid who overheard the conversation, ''I have not told you this before, but I must tell you now. You run your house and I'll run mine.''         Although it has been almost 40 years since Mrs. Parks retired, there is reason to suspect that she may still be haunting the White House, a residence replete with ghosts.         As she described it in her book, on one of her first visits to the White House in 1909, her mother turned down the President's bed, then left her daughter in the bedroom, ordering her to stay put while she took care of some brief duties elsewhere.         While she waited, a ''very stout,'' ''jolly,'' man came into the room, took one look at the girl wearing a prim white dress and said: ''Well, what have we here? Are you the little ghost of the White House I've been hearing about?''       
         Mary Brooks Griswold, who served four terms in the Connecticut legislature after the death of her husband, A. Whitney Griswold, a Yale University president, died on Nov. 15 at Fox Hill Village in Westwood, Mass. She was 91, and lived in New Haven.         She was a native of Scranton, Pa., graduated from Smith College in 1930 and was married two years later. Her husband was president of Yale from 1950 until his death in 1963.         Mrs. Griswold, a lifelong Democrat, rediscovered her interest in public education and entered politics at age 57. She was a delegate to the Connecticut Constitutional Convention in 1965 and was elected to the General Assembly the following year for the first of four terms. Throughout, she served on the Assembly's Education Committee.         Mrs. Griswold is survived by three daughters, Sarah Leahy of Chestnut Hill, Mass., Mary Flender of Cambridge, Mass., and Susanna G. Kaleck of Hamden, Conn.; a son, A. Whitney Jr., of West Tisbury, Mass.,  nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Stevenson Meyner, a liberal Democrat who was elected to two terms in Congress by a heavily Republican district in New Jersey, died yesterday after a long illness at the Heartland Health Care Center, a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 69.         Mrs. Meyner was born into a prominent Democratic family in New York City in 1928. Her parents, William E. and Eleanor B. Stevenson, set up American Red Cross units in England and North Africa during World War II. Her father, who founded the law firm that became Debevoise & Plimpton, was president of Oberlin College in Ohio after the war and Ambassador to the Philippines from 1961 to 1964.         A graduate of Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Mrs. Meyner was a field worker for the Red Cross in Korea from 1950 to 1952, then a tour guide at the United Nations. There, she met an executive of Trans World Airlines, who hired her to travel the world promoting T.W.A. under the name Mary Gordon.         In 1956, she volunteered for the Presidential campaign of Adlai E. Stevenson, a distant cousin of her mother's, and met Gov. Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey, who was visiting Oberlin College. They were married the following year.         At Morven, the governor's mansion in Princeton, Mrs. Meyner welcomed visitors like Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. She also served on the boards of the Newark Museum, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and Rider College. As a member of a panel of the Kennedy Administration, Mrs. Meyner studied the problems of the United States Foreign Service corps in Eastern Europe.         Because of a two-term limit, the Meyners left Morven in 1962 and bought a home in Princeton. Mr. Meyner began a law practice, and Mrs. Meyner continued her community service.         After four years of fertility treatment in the late 1960's, Mrs. Meyner became pregnant for the first time and gave an interview to The Ladies' Home Journal for an article titled ''My Miracle Baby.'' But in February 1970, the month the article was published, her baby, a full-term boy, was born dead. Mrs. Meyner is survived by a sister, Priscilla Hunt, of Cambridge, Mass.         In 1972, Democratic Party leaders asked her to run for Congress from the Meyner family home in Phillipsburg, in the heavily Republican 13th Congressional District in Sussex and Morris Counties. She lost that election to Joseph J. Maraziti, a Republican, but defeated him in 1974, the same year that Representative Millicent Fenwick, a Republican, was elected. Only two other women had represented New Jersey on Capitol Hill before.         Overshadowed somewhat by Representative Fenwick, Mrs. Meyner, who established a solidly liberal voting record, was sometimes referred to as New Jersey's ''other Congresswoman.''         During her two terms in office, Mrs. Meyner served on the Committee on International Relations, but turned down an invitation to join the powerful Ways and Means Committee, saying she feared stretching herself too thin. As a member of International Relations, she fought to stop the nuclear arms race, but she  helped prevent the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County from closing in 1976 by having the Armament Research and Development Command transferred there.         Mrs. Meyner also pressed for women's rights while in Congress. In 1978, she was defeated by the Republican candidate, Jim Courter.         After leaving Washington, Mrs. Meyner served on the boards of directors of Allied Chemical, Girard Trust and Prudential Insurance, and through her work in these companies, she continued to advocate for women. In 1990, Governor Meyner died and Mrs. Meyner retired to Captiva Island, Fla. She and her family established the Robert B. Meyner and Helen S. Meyner Center for the Study of State and Local Government at her husband's alma mater, Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.       
         Toni Carabillo, a leader and historian of the modern feminist movement, died on Oct. 28 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said Susie Gilligan of Feminist Majority, a national group that Ms. Carabillo helped found 10 years ago.         Ms. Carabillo, who was co-author of ''Feminist Chronicles, 1953-1993,'' rallied to the feminist cause more than 30 years ago when she joined the National Organization for Women. Under her guidance, NOW branches took root throughout California, and she served over the years as president of the Los Angeles chapter, national vice president, a board member and co-editor of the organization's national newsletter.         She founded Feminist Majority in 1987 together with Eleanor Smeal, Peg Yorkin, Katherine Spillar and Judith Meuli, her companion and partner in a Los Angeles graphic arts business since 1970. The group seeks to encourage women to attain positions of leadership in all walks of life.         The group promotes women who are on their way up as professionals in the private and public sectors. It conducts campus campaigns, makes available internships, compiles statistics and maintains a speakers' bureau.         At her death, Ms. Carabillo was national vice president. Ms. Smeal is president.         ''Feminist Chronicles,'' written with Ms. Meuli and June Csida and published in 1993 by Graphics Press, became a textbook for women's studies in colleges and universities. With Ms. Meuli, Ms. Carabello also wrote ''The Feminization of Power'' (Fund for the Feminist Majority, 1988). Ms. Carabillo had recently been working on ''The Feminist Chronicles of the 20th Century,'' a volume that Ms. Smeal and Ms. Meuli plan to complete.         Ms. Carabillo was born in Jackson Heights, Queens. Majoring in American literature, she graduated from Middlebury College in 1948 and earned a master's degree the next year at Columbia University. She went on to work as a writer and graphic designer.         In 1969, she co-founded the Women's Heritage Corporation, a publishing company. It produced ''Women's Heritage Calendar and Almanac'' and paperbacks about women's rights advocates like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucy Stone.         Ms. Carabillo leaves no immediate family.       
         Rosemarie Rogers, a scholar of international migrations and former academic dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, died on Nov. 28 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 61.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone-marrow cancer, said her husband, Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering at Harvard University.         Dr. Rogers was a native of Austria, and her fluency in several languages led her to a career in international relations. She lectured in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving to the Fletcher School, where she advanced to a full professorship and served as academic dean from 1985 to 1987.         Her more than 50 papers, monographs, book chapters and books reflected her research on international migrations, including forced migrations and refugee policies.         At her death she was completing a comparative study of the migration policy of six Western European countries. In it she documented the difficulties host countries have, on the one hand, encouraging migrants to return home, and on the other, integrating them into their own societies.         Her recent research was foreshadowed in an earlier book, ''Guests Come to Stay: The Effects of European Labor Migration on Sending and Receiving Countries'' (1985). Another volume, written with Emily Copeland, ''Forced Migration: Policy Issues in the Post-Cold War World'' (1993), was widely distributed by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and various national governments.         Dr. Rogers was born Rosemarie Straussnigg in Klagenfurt, Austria, and studied at the Universities of Vienna and Innsbruck, the University of Texas and the Sorbonne. She settled in the United States in 1958 and earned a doctorate in political science at M.I.T. in 1967.         She served on the board of the World Peace Foundation.         Besides her husband, Dr. Rogers is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Cambridge, and Justin, of Albuquerque, N.M.       
         Lillian Disney, the widow of Walt Disney and a prominent patron of the arts, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles after suffering a stroke on Monday. She was 98.         Mrs. Disney, who met Mr. Disney in the 1920's while working at a low-level job at his fledgling studio, was married to the mogul for 41 years. ''This really is the end of an era for Disney,'' said Roy E. Disney, a nephew of Mrs. Disney's and vice chairman of the Walt Disney Company. He added: ''She was a great lady, full of laughter and fun and always prepared to speak the truth, tough and loving at the same time.''         A publicity-shy figure, Mrs. Disney became highly active in a number of charities after her husband's death in 1966 and emerged as a leading patron of the arts. She helped found the California Institute of the Arts, a somewhat avant-garde school that has produced many of the nation's most formidable animators.         In May 1987, Mrs. Disney made a landmark gift of $50 million to the Music Center of Los Angeles County to build a world-class concert hall for the city. Although plans for the grandiose concert hall had stalled in recent years, mostly because of financial and artistic disagreements, the project was recently revived with a $25 million donation from the Walt Disney Company. It is scheduled to be completed in the year 2001.         During her marriage, Mrs. Disney served as her husband's sounding board and unofficial adviser. By all accounts he would discuss his ideas -- from Snow White to the creation of Disneyland -- with Mrs. Disney and sought her approval.         On a train ride from New York City to Los Angeles, after a serious business setback, Mr. Disney came up with a new character: Mortimer Mouse. ''Not Mortimer,'' said his wife. ''It's too formal. How about Mickey?''         Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, said, ''Mrs. Disney was a full-time partner to Walt and we are all grateful for her contributions in the creation of Mickey Mouse and the Disney Company and the example she set for family life and community service.''         Although a vocal figure behind the scenes, Mrs. Disney rarely spoke publicly and appeared at few Hollywood events. One of the few times she made a public comment came after the publication of a book, ''Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince'' (1993), by Marc Eliot. The book depicted Walt Disney as a political reactionary, anti-Semite and a Hollywood informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         In a statement, Mrs. Disney said: ''We shared a wonderful, exciting life and we loved every minute of it. He was a wonderful husband to me and a wonderful and loyal father and grandfather. I am distressed to learn of a new book about Walt that actually invents incidents that never happened.''         Last year Mrs. Disney donated $100,000 to the Nez Perce Indians, who were seeking to buy some ancient tribal artifacts. Mrs. Disney grew up in Lapwai, Idaho, on the Nez Perce Indian reservation. Her father worked for the Government as a blacksmith and Federal marshal.         She came to Los Angeles in 1923 to join her older sister, Hazel. A friend of her sister was working at the new Walt Disney studios, and told her about a job opening there. She found a job as a $15-a-week ''inker'' of film frames. She married Walt Disney on July 13, 1925, in Lewiston, Idaho.         A daughter that the Disneys adopted, Sharon Disney, died in 1993. She is survived by another daughter, Diane Disney Miller of Napa, Calif., who has played an important role in the plan for the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. She is also survived by 10 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Esther Peterson, a dogged consumer advocate whose work has an impact on Americans every time they buy a can of soup or a box of laundry detergent, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Peterson served in the Administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and worked for businesses as well. Among her accomplishments was the labeling of foods with their nutritional value, so that shoppers can determine whether so many vitamins and proteins are worth their price in calories.         Similarly, she successfully advocated that products be priced per unit, so that a calculator was not needed to figure out whether 14.5 ounces of breakfast cereal at $4.29 or 15.75 ounces at $4.59 is the better buy.         And she accomplished those things with a gentle cajoling that masked an iron determination. At a party marking Mrs. Peterson's 90th birthday last year, Lynda Johnson Robb recalled the help that her father, President Johnson, got from Mrs. Peterson, and said, ''She had a velvet hammer and talked people into doing what was right, even if we didn't know it at the time.''         In her long career, in which she was active until just recently, Mrs. Peterson was an educator, a labor organizer, a public official and an advocate of women's rights.         She organized a strike in Boston in the 1930's among women who sewed aprons at home and were forced by their employer to switch from square pockets to heart-shaped ones, which were more difficult to cut and sew, without any increase in wages.         ''She won the strike,'' her son Iver said over the weekend, ''after she told the women to picket the boss but to dress nicely, because the police in Boston used to back their horses into pickets, 'but if you are properly dressed, the police won't do it.' ''         Mrs. Peterson was born in 1906 in Provo, Utah, to two immigrants from Denmark, Lars Eggertsen, the local superintendent of schools, and his wife, Annie, who, according to her son, ''kept boarders because they didn't pay superintendents much in those days.''         She received a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University in 1927 and a master's from Teachers' College, Columbia University, in 1930. She held several teaching positions in the 1930's, including one at the innovative Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which brought milliners, telephone operators and garment workers onto the campus.         A Bryn Mawr College official described the school as a place ''not only to teach but to learn from the women workers the problems that together they and we must solve,'' but her son said that Mrs. Peterson's description was more succinct: a place that combined Shakespeare, drama and socialism.         She worked for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the American Federation of Teachers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. In 1961, President Kennedy named her an Assistant Secretary of Labor and Director of the Women's Bureau, an agency that administered the labor laws concerning women.         When Mr. Johnson became President, he brought Mrs. Peterson into the White House as his special adviser for consumer affairs, and she served in a similar capacity for President Carter.         In 1971, at the age of 65, Mrs. Peterson started another career, this time in business as vice president for consumer affairs at Giant Food Inc., the largest supermarket chain in the Washington-Baltimore area.         Odonna Mathews, who worked with Mrs. Peterson as a University of Maryland undergraduate intern and now holds Mrs. Peterson's old position at Giant, said: ''Her friends in consumer activism asked, 'How can you work for a business and represent the consumer?' She showed it could be done.''         At Giant, Ms. Mathews said, she worked with Mrs. Peterson on the grade labeling of food. ''She found it confusing,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She asked, 'What's the difference between U.S. Fancy No. 1 and Extra Fancy?' ''         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson persuaded the supermarket to disclose what seafood had been previously frozen, a widespread practice now but one not in use before then.         ''She got Giant to try nutritional labeling on its private products before it was required by Federal law, comparing calories and proteins,'' Ms. Mathews said. ''She got Giant to use open dating -- putting a date by which products like yogurt or milk must be sold.''         Before then, the stores used letter and number combinations to express the dates, a code that was not clear to buyers.         Ms. Mathews said Mrs. Peterson visited Giant stores often and was easily recognized by shoppers. She was tall, about 5 feet 10 inches, and she wore her long braided gray hair in a distinctive upsweep on the top of her head, a style described by her children as a ''Gretchen braid.''         Her photograph appeared in many of Giant's advertisements, including one in April 1972 when a shortage of beef caused its price to rocket and Mrs. Peterson urged the supermarket chain's customers to avoid beef purchases until the price came down.         ''You have a right to be informed about meat prices,'' a Giant advertisement said. ''We consumers can help bring prices down. Buy less meat. Use other forms of protein.''         The advertisement listed alternatives to meat like beans and lentils and was signed by Mrs. Peterson.         Mrs. Peterson later was hired by the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents as its consumer adviser, concerning herself particularly with the problems of older people, and she continued to keep a foot in both camps, serving on the board of Consumers Union.         She ended her public service career under yet another Democratic President, serving in a largely honorary role for the Clinton Administration with the United States Delegation to the United Nations.         Besides her son Iver, of Lawrenceville, N.J., who is a reporter for The New York Times, Mrs. Peterson is survived by two other sons, Eric N.,  of Alexandria, Va., and Lars E., of Washington; a daughter, Karen K. Wilken of Fort Collins, Colo., and 12 grandchildren.       
         Denise Levertov, a poet of intense emotion and fervid political conviction, died on Saturday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lymphoma, said Griselda Ohannessian of New Directions, Ms. Levertov's publisher.         As a poet and political activist, Ms. Levertov was ''a touchstone, a maintainer for our generation,'' the poet Robert Creeley, one of her first publishers in the United States, said yesterday. ''She was a constantly defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming poet for all of us. She always had a vivid emotional response and also a completely dedicated sense of political and social need.''         The poet Kenneth Rexroth once wrote that Ms. Levertov was ''the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.''         In the tradition established by William Carlos Williams, she wrote with a concrete immediacy of language. She spoke directly through her poetry, favoring commonplace objects and images over large philosophical concepts.         The author of more than 30 books of poetry, essays and translations, she wrote with great particularity and sensitivity about aspects of love, spiritual as well as erotic. More and more, her work conveyed her political awareness and social consciousness. She was, as in the title of her first book of essays, ''The Poet in the World.'' At the same time, in her art she would contemplate her own life, writing confessional poems about her marital and familial problems. For her, content and form were ''in a dynamic state of interaction.''         In ''The Ache of Marriage,'' she wrote:         The ache of marriage:         thigh and tongue, beloved,         are heavy with it,         it throbs in the teeth         We look for communion         and are turned away, beloved,         each and each         It is leviathan and we         in its belly         looking for joy, some joy         not to be known outside it         two by two in the ark of         the ache of it.         And in ''Of Being,'' she wrote:         I know this happiness         is provisional:         the looming presences --         great suffering, great fear --         withdraw only         into peripheral vision:         but ineluctable this shimmering         of wind in the blue leaves:         this flood of stillness         widening the lake of sky:         this need to dance,         this need to kneel:         this mystery:         A defining moment of her life was the Vietnam War. She helped found a group called the Writers' and Artists' Protest Against the War in Vietnam, she was actively involved in the anti-nuclear movement, and in 1967 she edited a volume of poetry for the War Resisters League. In the same year, she published ''The Sorrow Dance,'' a book of poems whose sorrow included the war and also the death of the poet's sister.         Ms. Levertov was born in Ilford, England. Her father was Paul Philip Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and became an Anglican priest. Her mother was from Wales. Her father's conversations about the family background in Hasidism and her mother's knowledge of Welsh and English folklore proved influential. Educated by her parents, she was introduced to poetry by her older sister, Olga, and was writing from an early age.         During World War II, she worked as a nurse in London and also began publishing her poetry. In 1940 her first poem appeared in Poetry Quarterly, and, said Mr. Rexroth, he and other poets were soon ''in excited correspondence about her'' as ''the baby of the new Romanticism.'' Her first volume of verse, ''The Double Image,'' was published in 1946.         After the war she married Mitchell Goodman, an American writer, and for several years they lived in France near Mr. Creeley, who was a friend of Mr. Goodman. In 1948 the couple moved to the United States, where Ms. Levertov studied and was influenced by such modernist poets as Williams, Wallace Stevens and Ezra Pound, and also continued her artistic relationship with Mr. Creeley, Robert Duncan and other Black Mountain poets.         Both she and her husband frequently spoke out on political issues, particularly regarding the Vietnam War. Mr. Goodman was convicted along with Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling resistance of the draft. Ms. Levertov and Mr. Goodman were divorced in 1975. Mr. Goodman died last February. They had one son, Nikolai, who lives in Seattle.         When Ms. Levertov's 11th collection of verse, ''The Freeing of the Dust,'' was published in 1975, the poet David Ignatow wrote in The New York Times Book Review that ''by nearly unanimous agreement Levertov was well on her way to becoming one of our leading poets'' with ''her forceful and compassionate presentations of urban lives'' and ''the beauty and sensuousness of her nature poems.'' By shifting to ''passionate Vietnam poems,'' she had lost some of her following but gained a new vitality.         Ms. Levertov wrote through six decades. In the 1990's, she published ''New and Selected Essays''; four poetry volumes, ''Evening Train,'' ''Sands of the Well,'' ''The Life Around Us: Selected Poems on Nature'' and ''The Stream and The Sapphire: Selected Poems on Religious Themes,'' and the prose memoir  ''Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions.''         She taught at colleges and universities, and served as poetry editor of The Nation and Mother Jones. Among her honors were the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in poetry and the $50,000 Lannan Prize. In 1996, she won the Governor's Award from the Washington State Commission for the Humanities.         She felt compelled to clarify and justify the uses of poetry in a world of political crisis. In ''New and Selected Essays'' she wrote, ''One is in despair over the current manifestation of malevolent imbecility and the seemingly invincible power of rapacity, yet finds oneself writing a poem about the trout lilies in the spring woods. And one has promised to speak at a meeting or help picket a building. If one is conscientious, the only solution is to attempt to weigh conflicting claims at each crucial moment, and in general to try to juggle well and keep all the oranges dancing in the air at once.''         Ms. Levertov was a masterly juggler of words, images and feelings, as well as a defender of artistic and political liberty.         In ''Overheard Over S.E. Asia,'' she wrote:         I am the snow that burns.         I fall         wherever men send me to fall --         but I prefer flesh, so smooth, so dense:         I decorate it in black, and seek the bone.       
         Claire Giannini Hoffman, the first woman to serve on the boards of  Bank of America and Sears, Roebuck & Company, died Monday of respiratory failure at her home in San Mateo, Calif., the bank said. She was 92.         In 1949 Mrs. Hoffman became a director of the Bank of America, succeeding her father, A.P. Giannini, the bank's founder, who died that year. She served until 1986. Mrs. Hoffman joined the Sears board in 1963 and served until 1970.         Her husband, Clifford Pierson Hoffman, died in 1954. She had no children. Her estate will pass to her private foundation, the bank said.       
         Margaret Storrs Grierson, the former archivist of Smith College who built its Sophia Smith Collection into an international research center, died on Dec. 12 at the Linda Manor Extended Care Facility in Leeds, Mass. She was 97.         Born in Denver, she graduated from Smith in 1922 and earned a doctorate seven years later at Bryn Mawr College, where she taught for several years. Returning to Smith, she taught philosophy until she was named archivist in 1940.         In 1942 she took on the additional tasks of executive secretary of Friends of the Library and director of its fledgling Sophia Smith Collection. Named after the college's patron, the collection initially served as a repository of works by female writers but grew over the years into a women's history archive.         From the modest beginning of the collection and until she retired in 1965, Dr. Grierson traveled the world to document the experience of women from the colonial era to the present. The collection now stretches over some 5,500 feet of shelves and includes materials about women's rights, suffrage, birth control, the women's movement of recent years  and women in the arts.         Traditional historiography had often overlooked women's roles, and the Smith collection helped supply the records once researchers began their studies of women. Sherrill Redmon, director of the collection, called Dr. Grierson ''one of the unsung heroes who made the field of women's history possible.''         Dr. Grierson is survived by a brother, Lucius S. Storrs Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.       
         After Shira A. Scheindlin was appointed to the Federal District Court in Manhattan a few years ago, she told an interviewer for a legal newspaper that she expected to be more of a ''settling judge than a brilliant opinion writer.''         But in case after case these days, Judge Scheindlin seems to be making a name for herself through the incisive, often witty opinions she writes as well as the striking decisions they contain.         On Monday, in a major ruling against the Giuliani administration, she found that city officials had violated New York magazine's free speech rights when they pulled satirical advertisements from buses. The ads tweaked the Mayor for taking credit for most of the city's virtues.         Her 30-page decision was full of meticulous constitutional analysis, but it was also tinged with sarcasm and humor. ''Who would have dreamed that the Mayor would object to more publicity?'' Judge Scheindlin wrote, going out of her way to cite Mr. Giuliani's daily presence in the local newspapers and his appearance in drag last month on ''Saturday Night Live.''         Then, on Thursday, she found herself in the middle of another contentious dispute, between the two most powerful prosecutors in New York City: Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and United States Attorney Mary Jo White.         Mr. Morgenthau's senior aides had asked Judge Scheindlin to block Ms. White's prosecutors from completing a plea agreement in a stock trading case that Mr. Morgenthau had initiated. ''This is a dispute between your bosses,'' the judge said, ruling against Mr. Morgenthau's prosecutors. ''They should sit down for coffee some day and talk about it.''         The judge behind these rulings is a 51-year-old with a master's degree in Chinese history from Columbia University and a law degree from Cornell. She acknowledged that she has ''been doing more on the opinion side'' than she thought she would when President Clinton named her to the Federal bench in 1994.         ''The only answer I can say is that there have been wonderful issues that just begged to be addressed,'' said Judge Scheindlin (pronounced SHEND-lin) during an interview in her 10th-floor chambers in the Federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. ''And I like to write. It's fun.''         But her rulings have drawn the ire of the Mayor and others. For two straight days this week, Mr. Giuliani attacked her decision in the New York magazine case, saying she had ''tortured her interpretation to get where she is.''         Last January, after she suppressed evidence in a case and questioned a program in which the police stopped and searched taxicabs, Mr. Giuliani declared that Judge Scheindlin did not care as much for ''the rights of victims and potential victims as accused criminals.''         And recently, the Federal Court of Appeals overturned another decision, in which she found unconstitutional a law allowing the Government to ban the sale of sexually explicit magazines on military bases.         Nonetheless, other legal experts defend her work. Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said of her New York magazine opinion: ''The idea that this is some sort of torturous reach by her is simply inaccurate. What is unusual here is not the judicial ruling that the First Amendment has been violated, but the Mayor's conduct, which led to the violation.''         As for the taxicab search ruling, Matthew E. Fishbein, a senior Federal prosecutor at the time, said that although Judge Scheindlin rejected the Government's position in the case, ''the degree of criticism directed at her was in my view excessive and unfair.''         In the opinion, he said, ''she went out of her way to suggest ways for the department to conform its policy so that it would pass constitutional muster, something that the department ultimately did.''         Judge Scheindlin will not discuss individual cases, but says she can live with the criticism. ''I realize that some of the decisions are not immediately popular,'' she said. But she believes there is a balance. The long-term benefit, she says, ''is that we keep our constitutional rights.''         Judge Scheindlin, the daughter of a Russian immigrant and his American wife, was born in Washington.  She grew up in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan.         She had never even met a ''real live lawyer,'' she said, until she entered law school in 1972. After graduating, she was a clerk for Judge Charles L. Brieant in Federal District Court in Manhattan, who remembers her as someone who ''got to the point.''         ''Her logic and her thinking are just without parallel,'' Judge Brieant said.         She was in private practice, and served as a United States magistrate and a Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, before being named to the Federal bench. Now, as then, she says she believes that lawyers and judges can make a difference in society.         In personal conversations, the judge laces her comments with a puckish humor and a bright laugh. From the bench, though, she does not waste words. She can seem brusque, and will cut off a lawyer who is rambling. Several lawyers say they have been the target of her withering glance and her admonition that they make their case more clearly.         A week ago, as the oral arguments in the New York magazine case came to a close, one of the city's lawyers rose. ''May I just have half a minute?'' he asked, with apparent trepidation in his voice.         ''I doubt that it is really going to take half a minute,'' Judge Scheindlin said. ''If you let me cut you off in 30 seconds, go ahead.''         One half-minute later, she interrupted him: ''That was 30 seconds. Is that the point?'' In six words, she then summarized it, asking, ''Was that the point?''         ''Yes, Your Honor,'' the lawyer replied.         Ronald L. Kuby, the criminal defense lawyer known for his passionate advocacy and, at times, his loquaciousness in the courtroom, said he had been chastised by Judge Scheindlin, but rightly so.         ''In court, she's brilliant,'' he said. ''Incisive. Suffers fools not at all.'' He said she pays attention to what a lawyer says and ''she gets very upset when you repeat it. Because she actually heard it the first time.''         The judge, in an interview, acknowledged that her style can be quite direct.         You like to get to the point, she was told.         ''Yes,'' she replied.         Do you realize that about yourself?         ''Yes.''         It is part of your style?         ''Yes.''         You do it with everybody?         ''Yes.''         ''People could talk endlessly around and around an issue,'' she went on. ''Let's get to the heart of the matter. I try to be very direct.'' She added: ''I often say to lawyers, what do you want? Focus yourself. Then I get a much better answer.''         The demands she makes of lawyers, she imposes on herself. As arguments ended in the New York magazine case, on a Friday afternoon, she said she would rule ''as soon as humanly possible.''         She worked through the weekend in her chambers, a court staff member said, and when she had not finished by Sunday evening, worked throughout the night. The opinion was ready for release on Monday morning.         ''I felt the urgency of the parties' needs -- both sides,'' she said.       
         Jeannette Edris Rockefeller, a lifelong volunteer and philanthropist, a former First Lady of Arkansas and stepmother of its current Lieutenant Governor, died of heart failure on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif., where she had lived for nearly 10 years. She was 79.         Mrs. Rockefeller took part in a wide variety of public causes while her husband, Winthrop Rockefeller, was in office, transforming the role of First Lady in Arkansas into a public partnership.         She was the second wife of Mr. Rockefeller, the first Republican Governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction, who served two terms, from 1967 to 1970. They divorced a year later. Mr. Rockefeller died in 1973.         President Clinton, one of his successors in Little Rock, said Mrs. Rockefeller had helped to take the ''New South'' to Arkansas and to lead women into the mainstream of political and public life.         ''She spearheaded education and cultural outreach across the state through the Arkansas Arts Center,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House. He called her ''a strong voice against discrimination.''         Mrs. Rockefeller was an important backer of a Martin Luther King Memorial Service on the State Capitol steps after Dr. King was assassinated in 1968. The rally, attended by thousands of people, helped defuse what might have been a tense situation in the state.         A native of Seattle, Mrs. Rockefeller studied at the University of Washington and Finch College in New York, majoring in psychology. She met Winthrop Rockefeller while working with teen-age drug addicts and mentally ill children in New York, and they married in 1956.         Mrs. Rockefeller was president of the National Mental Health Association and the Arkansas Association for Mental Health. She served on the national board of the Urban League and the White House Commission on Mental Health under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. More recently she headed the AIDS Assistance Project in Palm Springs.         In addition to her stepson, Lieut. Gov. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, her survivors include a son and daughter from another marriage, Bruce Bartley of Little Rock, and Anne Bartley McNeil of San Francisco.
