         Marion Savage Rosette, a pianist, teacher and composer of children's songs, died at her home in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was 90 years old.         She died of brain cancer, said her daughter, Margot Sohmer of Jackson Heights, Queens.         "Katie the Kangaroo," "City Mouse and Country Mouse" and "The Monkey Who Wanted to Fly" are among the songs by Mrs. Rosette that were familiar to a generation of children who watched the television show "Captain Kangaroo." She also wrote nightclub and music hall material.         She was a native of Baltimore and studied piano at the Peabody Conservatory of Music there. On several occasions, she was the soloist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. She also worked as an accompanist for many dancers, singers and instrumentalists.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two granddaughters, Emily Tai and Olivia Sohmer, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Alberta Masiello, a longtime singers' coach at the Metropolitan Opera and a regular panelist in the Saturday afternoon Metropolitan Opera Quiz, died on Christmas Day at her Manhattan apartment. She was 75 years old.         Her physician, Dr. Sidney Goldstine, said she had been suffering from a long illness.         Miss Masiello was born in Milan, Italy, into a family of singers; her mother, Josephine La Puma, had a subsequent career with small opera companies in New York City. Trained as a pianist at the Milan conservatory, Miss Masiello moved to the United States with her mother in the late 1930's, where she studied further at the Juilliard School.         Gravitating to singing, she had a brief career as a mezzo-soprano, appearing in nightclubs during World War II and as Carmen and in other roles at the fledgling New York City Opera in the 1940's. But she soon devoted herself to vocal coaching, working privately in Manhattan and at the Chicago Lyric Opera in the 1950's before joining the Metropolitan in 1959.         Her initial title was rehearsal pianist, but in 1967 that was upgraded to assistant conductor, although she never conducted a performance at the Met. Her task was to prepare singers and accompany rehearsals of the mainstream Italian repertory. She retired from the Met in 1981.         Miss Masiello was best known for her frequent appearances on the Metropolitan Opera Quiz, an intermission feature of the Metropolitan's nationally broadcast Saturday matinee performances. There her store of knowledge and imperious manner beguiled listeners for more than 30 years, from her first appearance in 1959 as an accompanying pianist, to her last, in the spring of 1990.         There are no survivors.       
         Esther Fisher, a classical pianist, died here last Tuesday. She was 90 years old.         No cause of death was given.         She was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, and went to London in 1919. Ferruccio Busoni, the Italian pianist and composer, encouraged her to study with Isidore Philipp in Paris.         She later studied with Artur Schnabel in Berlin. She made her debut in London in 1923.         She became a professor at the Royal College of Music in London and married Sir John Barran in 1946. He died in 1952.

         Ruth Page, a pioneering American ballet dancer and one of the first ballet choreographers to employ American subject matter, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 92 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, said Andrew Mark Wentink, her biographer.         Miss Page, who arranged Rudolf Nureyev's New York debut by engaging him for one of the companies she directed, was involved with an almost bewildering array of activities. She performed with Anna Pavlova's classical ballet company, with Serge Diaghilev's avant-garde Ballets Russes and with German Expressionist modern dancers.         She appeared in opera houses around the world, danced at the coronation of Emperor Hirohito of Japan in 1928 and gave programs in the Soviet Union in 1930. But she remained proudly American, making Chicago the base of her activities and refusing to change her name at a time when many Americans adopted exotic stage names.  Wide Range as Choreographer         An eclectic choreographer, Miss Page is known for "Hear Ye, Hear Ye" (1934), a ballet about a murder trial to a commissioned score by Aaron Copland; "An American Pattern" (1937), a feminist protest against conformity; "Billy Sunday" (1948), a ballet derived from a fiery evangelist's sermons, and several ballets based on famous operas.         During the 30's, her partner was Bentley Stone, an American choreographer with whom she occasionally collaborated on works. Their most enduring achievement is "Frankie and Johnny," which was inspired by a bawdy old ballad about love and betrayal. Since its premiere in 1938, it has been successfully revived by many companies, including Dance Theater of Harlem. Reviewing a production by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1947, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, "It convinces you of its human truth even while you are chortling at its crude and uninhibited sentimentalities."         Miss Page was born in Indianapolis on March 22, 1899, the daughter of Dr. Lafayette Page, a brain surgeon, and Marian Heinly, a pianist. Her parents encouraged her desire to dance and sent her to study with local teachers. In 1914, the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova was a guest at the Page house and was so impressed by Miss Page that she encouraged the teen-ager to make dancing her career. Miss Page appeared briefly with Pavlova's company that year.         Moving to Chicago, Miss Page studied with Adolph Bolm, a former member of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes who had settled in America and was staging productions both for Chicago companies and for his itinerant Ballet Intime. In 1919 Bolm choreographed "The Birthday of the Infanta" for Miss Page, one of the first 20th-century ballets with a score by an American composer (John Alden Carpenter) and scenery by an American designer (Robert Edmond Jones).  In a Stravinsky Premiere         Bolm and Miss Page again made history in 1928, when she portrayed Terpsichore in the world premiere of Stravinsky's "Apollo," choreographed by Bolm in Washington months before George Balanchine created his more familiar version of the ballet for Diaghilev.         Miss Page married Thomas Hart Fisher, a well-to-do Chicago lawyer, in 1925, and on her honeymoon in Europe danced with Diaghilev's company. While she was with the Ballets Russes, Balanchine choreographed two divertissements for her, "Etude" and "Polka Melancolique," which are believed to be his first works created for an American.         Always curious about dance forms, Miss Page studied with Mary Wigman, the great German Expressionist choreographer, in 1930. In 1933, she toured with another important German modern dancer, Harald Kreutzberg.         During the 1940's, she staged works in Chicago and for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She choreographed "Revanche," a ballet version of "Il Trovatore," for Les Ballets des Champs-Elysees in Paris in 1951, and "Vilia," an adaptation of "The Merry Widow," for the London Festival Ballet in 1953. Their success prompted her to found the Chicago Opera Ballet in 1956, a touring company that featured ballets inspired by operas and operettas. Yet it also presented internationally known stars in classial excerpts. It was with this troupe that Mr. Nureyev made his New York City debut in 1962. Later known as Ruth Page's International Ballet, it continued until 1970.  An Annual 'Nutcracker'         In Chicago in 1965, Miss Page staged a production of "The Nutcracker" that remains an annual event in that city. She frequently revived her works for regional companies and directed the Ruth Page Foundation School of the Dance, which will continue under the direction of Larry Long.         Miss Page's first husband, Mr. Fisher, died in 1969. She married the French artist and stage designer Andre Delfau in 1983. Miss Page was the author of "Page by Page" (1980) and "Class" (1984). She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1980 and the Illinois Gubernatorial Award in 1985, and held honorary degrees from Indiana University, De Paul University and Columbia College of Chicago.         She is survived by her husband and a brother, Dr. Irvine Page of Hyannis, Mass.       
         Wally Toscanini, a daughter of Arturo Toscanini who was known in Italy for her charitable works, died yesterday at the home of her daughter in Rome. She was 91 years old and had lived in Rome in recent years.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her sister, Wanda Horowitz of Manhattan.         One of Toscanini's three children, Walter, Wally and Wanda, she lived most of her life in Milan. She devoted much of her time to raising money for orphaned children throughout Italy and for restoring La Scala, where her father was the principal conductor for many years.         Her marriage to Count Emanuele di Castelbarco in 1931 ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, the widow of the pianist Vladimir Horowitz, she is survived by her daughter, Emanuela Castelbarco, and a grandson.       
         Elizabeth Sorel, a former fashion model, died Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Sorel died of complications from leukemia, said her daughter, Claudette.         In the 1920's and early 1930's, Mrs. Sorel was one of the most sought-after models in Paris, modeling for members of the haute couture like Jean Patou, Jacques Fath and Chanel. A native of Budapest, she came to the United States in the early 1940's and, with her husband, operated Sorel Belt Creations in Manhattan. The store was later sold. She also worked for Saks Fifth Avenue as an accessories designer for Sophie Gibel.         With her husband, Michel, who died in 1989, Mrs. Sorel operated the Shelton Apartments Inc., a real estate firm in Manhattan, from 1947 to her death.         She is survived by a daughter, Claudette, a concert pianist and a professor of music at the State University of New York at Fredonia, of Manhattan.       
         Miss Southern's recordings include "You Better Go Now," "When I Fall in Love," "An Occasional Man" and "Fire Down Below," which she sang in the Rita Hayworth film of the same name in 1957. That song made it to the top-10 spot on the pop-music charts.         Miss Southern, whose name was originally Genevieve Hering, was born in Royal, Neb. She began playing the piano as a child, and she trained as a classical pianist. She moved to Chicago in the mid-1940's. To support herself, she worked as a cocktail pianist, and built a reputation as a pop singer. She was signed by Decca Records, which released her first single in 1951.         In the late 1960's, Miss Southern stopped performing publicly and began teaching vocal and piano technique to others in the profession. She continued to write and arrange songs, and published a book, "Interpreting Popular Music at the Keyboard."         Miss Southern had been divorced for more than 10 years from the jazz musician Bill Holman, but she continued to use that last name privately. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Virginia Hoff Greenburg, a pianist, music teacher and co-founder of the prestigious Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale, N.Y., died on Friday at the Hospice of the Central Coast in Carmel, Calif. She was 91 years old.         She suffered a stroke at her home in Carmel on Sept. 14 and was in a coma until her death, family members said.         In 1944 she and the composer Joyce Barthelson founded the school with a few students in a private house in Scarsdale. Over the years it grew to occupy various annexes throughout the town. In 1972, it moved into its current home, the 36-room former Scarsdale Inn.         The school, which is for many a hub of Westchester musical life, now has 65 faculty members and 1,200 students and gives more than 200 concerts and recitals yearly, including those by the Philharmonia Virtuosi and the pianist Peter Serkin. It also has an extensive outreach program serving the elderly and the handicapped. Still Playing Near the End         Mrs. Greenburg was the director and driving force at the school for nearly 30 years before retiring in 1973, turning over its direction to Mary Helton, who had taught there since 1951.         Her first husband, Charles Hoff, died in 1949. In 1972, she married Reginald Greenburg. Soon after, they went to Carmel for a visit and soon moved there.         An accomplished pianist as well as teacher, she and Ms. Barthelson gave many two-piano recitals at the school and elsewhere. Even as her health began to fail in recent years, she kept playing. Shortly after her 90th birthday, she recorded herself performing Chopin Preludes and sent tapes to many relatives and friends.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Her sons, Hubert and Christopher, both died in 1974.         A memorial service at the school is being planned for next month.       
         Dorothy Berliner Commins, a concert pianist and author, died on Monday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 102 years old.         Mrs. Commins was born in New York City and made her recital debut at Town Hall at the age of 12. She studied in New York and in Europe and had an active career for five decades. Her last concert was at Town Hall in the mid-1950's.         In 1927 she married Saxe Commins, who became editor in chief at Random House. He died in 1958. Mrs. Commins's books included a biography of her husband, "What Is an Editor?" (1978); "All About the Symphony Orchestra and What It Plays" (1961); "Lullabies of the World" (1967), and a compilation of letters exchanged by her husband and the playwright Eugene O'Neill.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Frances Commins Bennett of New Haven, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Gabriella Pessl Sobotka, a harpsichordist, pianist and organist who performed as Yella Pessl, died on Sunday at her home in Northampton, Mass. She was 85 years old.         She died of a heart attack, said her sister, Margit Cartwright of Northampton.         Known for her interpretations of Bach, Miss Pessl was an active performer for more than half a century. As founder and director of the Bach Circle, a New York group specializing in lesser-known works of Bach and other Baroque composers, she helped introduce 18th-century music to a wide audience.         Miss Pessl was born in Vienna and studied there at the State Academy of Music. Before immigrating to the United States in 1931, she had a busy career performing in Europe.         In America, Miss Pessl toured extensively, playing solo recitals and with orchestras under conductors like Arturo Toscanini and Bruno Walter. In 1938 she accompanied the Trapp Family Singers, whom she had known in Vienna, at their Town Hall debut. She had her own radio program on WQXR, made recordings for the RCA Victor label and was on the faculty of Columbia University.         Her husband, Dr. Harry Sobotka, a biochemist at Mount Sinai Hospital, died in 1970.
