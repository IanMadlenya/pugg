        Carolyn Haywood, a popular author and illustrator of children's books who is best known for her ''Betsy'' and ''Eddie'' series for 7-to-10-year-olds, died of a stroke yesterday at her home in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. She was 92 years old.         Carolyn Haywood, a popular author and illustrator of children's books who is best known for her ''Betsy'' and ''Eddie'' series for 7-to-10-year-olds, died of a stroke yesterday at her home in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. She was 92 years old.         Miss Haywood's writing career began in 1939 with '' 'B' is for Betsy,'' published by Harcourt Brace. After eight books with that company, she moved to William Morrow & Company, where she published 39 more books, most recently, ''Hello, Star'' in 1987. Her last manuscript, ''Eddie's Friend, Boddles,'' was delivered to Morrow just before Christmas and is to be published next year.         Her picture books and novels used humor in dealing with day-to-day school and family matters. ''There are no great problems solved here, nor great adventures,'' a New York Times reviewer, Phyllis Fenner, wrote about ''Snowbound With Betsy'' (1962). ''Yet Carolyn Haywood makes the everyday doings of children exciting and funny, entering into them from a child's level. That is sheer genius and can't be done by calculation.''         Miss Haywood, who was known early on for her portraits of children, illustrated her own books until the 1970's, using as models children who lived in her neighborhood.         She was born in Philadelphia and studied to be a teacher before turning to art and to writing. She taught for a year in the Friends Central School in Philadelphia, then attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she studied portrait painting and won a scholarship for European travel.         She also studied privately. Miss Haywood did several mural decorations for Philadelphia banks and a public school, and did hand lettering and illumination as well as children's portraiture.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Candy Jones, a 1940's cover girl whose career later encompassed teaching, broadcasting and writing, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Jones instructed young women in charm, beauty and fitness as the owner-operator of the Candy Jones Career Girls School for more than 20 years. Later she and her husband, Long John Nebel, were co-hosts in Manhattan on a late-night talk and interview show, first on Radio Station WOR and then on WMCA. When Mr. Nebel died in 1978, she continued the all-night show until last year.         Candy Jones was born Jessica Arline Wilcox in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and educated in Atlantic City, where she won a beauty pageant at the age of 16. A trip to Manhattan followed, as did a modeling career and small roles in such 1940's Broadway musicals as ''Mexican Hayride'' and ''Polonaise.'' In World War II she headed a U.S.O. troupe called Cover Girls Abroad that entertained troops in the South Pacific.         Author of a Dozen Books         Tall, blond and with blue eyes, she gave beauty advice to women in more than a dozen books, including ''Make Your Name in Modeling and Television,'' ''Finishing Touches,'' ''Look Your Best,'' ''Between Us Girls'' and ''Candy Jones' Complete Book of Beauty and Fashion.'' Graduates of her school included Julia Meade and Sandra Dee.         In radio and television, Miss Jones was the hostess of several daytime talk and interview programs and took part in commercials as a performer, teacher and consultant. She also judged and advised beauty pageants and fashion shows around the country and lectured at colleges.         Before her marriage to Mr. Nebel, Miss Jones was married to Harry S. Conover, a model agency chief. The marriage ended in divorce.         Surviving are two sons, Harry Conover of Sudbury, Mass., and Carey Conover of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
        Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago.         The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).         Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).         Some of Her Other Films         Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953).         The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000.         From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards.         The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907.         When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again.         Left School at Age 13         Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family.         At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' ''         In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.         Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra.         'Beloved by All' Involved         Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.''         Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston.         Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times.         Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice:         ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.''         Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom.         Praise for 'Thorn Birds'         In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.''         Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce:         ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.''         In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer.

And, in 1987, her colleagues and admirers added their tributes to her independent spirit and professionalism as she received the 15th annual life achievement award of the American Film Institute.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).

        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President       
        Nancy Gruver, one of the nation's leading contract bridge players, died of a heart attack Sunday at Howard County General Hospital in Maryland. She was 58 years old and lived in Ellicott City, Md.         Nancy Gruver, one of the nation's leading contract bridge players, died of a heart attack Sunday at Howard County General Hospital in Maryland. She was 58 years old and lived in Ellicott City, Md.         Mrs. Gruver twice came close to winning a world title. In 1966 in Amsterdam, playing with Sue Sachs of Baltimore, she finished second in the World Women's Pair Championship.         In recent years her regular partner has been Edith Kemp Freilich. They were part of an American squad that finished second in the World Women's Team Championship in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1981.         In national championships she won the women's teams competition seven times and the women's pairs five times. She won the mixed pairs and master mixed teams events once each.         Mrs. Gruver, a bridge administrator, served as a member of the National Laws Commission of the American Contract Bridge League and as co-chairman of the national appeals committee, ruling on tournament disputes.         She is survived by her husband, John A. Gruver; a daughter, Cynthia Gruver-Williams of Carroll County, Md., and a son, John Gordon Gruver of College Park, Md.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Kate Simon, a writer of popular, literate and vivid travel guides and two memoirs that were hailed by reviewers as lucid, lively and humorous, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         Miss Simon's 10 travel works included the landmark - and best-selling - ''New York Places and Pleasures: An Uncommon Guidebook,'' which has undergone four revisions since 1959, and parallel studies of Mexico City, Paris, London and Rome. Among other guidebooks are ''Italy: The Places in Between'' (1970 and 1984), ''England's Green and Pleasant Land'' (1974), ''Fifth Avenue: A Very Social History'' (1978) and ''A Renaissance Tapestry: The Gonzaga of Mantua'' (1988).         Telling Her Own Story         Autobiographies by the soft-spoken, cosmopolitan writer are ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood'' (1982) and ''A Wider World: Portraits in an Adolescence'' (1986). Her brother, Michael Grobsmith, said yesterday that Miss Simon recently completed and sent to Harper & Row the manuscript of a third volume, tentatively titled ''Etchings on an Hour Glass,'' ranging from her college years through two marriages and career to her latest travels.         Sybil S. Steinberg described Miss Simon's travel books in ''Publishers Weekly'' as being ''in a class by themselves, distinctly personal guides of rare good taste and discernment.'' J. H. Plumb, in The New York Times Book Review, called her work ''incomparable'' in making ''one of the dullest forms of literature a brilliant work of art.''         Kate Simon, whose given name was Kaila Grobsmith, was born in a Warsaw ghetto on Dec. 5, 1912, came to this country with her family by steerage at the age of 4 and grew up in the Tremont section of the Bronx. In ''Bronx Primitive,'' she recalled vividly and unsentimentally her early years, her father, a tyrannical shoemaker, and her mother, who believed deeply in learning and in earning her own living before she married.         Exploring Her Adolescence         In ''A Wider World,'' Miss Simon recounted her rebellious adolescence, which helped get her into the challenging James Monroe High School, where she excelled; becoming a live-in baby sitter for an eccentric, radical family, and tentative, humorous and grim aspects of youthful sexuality. Robert Pinskey, in The New York Times Book Review, lauded her ''clean and unpretentious prose style, her aristocratic disdain for cant and her frank worldiness.''         She earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter College, held various editorial posts, mostly rewriting, and reviewed books for The New Republic and The Nation until she began writing travel guides. She won awards from the National Book Critics Circle, the English Speaking Union and Hunter College, where, her brother said, she was to begin teaching a writing course today.         Asked in 1986 by ''Contemporary Authors'' to advise travelers on how best to enjoy a trip, she replied: ''Go slow. If you have the time for eight countries, take five. If you're rushed to take five, take three.'' She also suggested regular eavesdropping on conversations in cafes, buses and trains and emphasized, ''Walk slowly, look, listen, smell.''         She had been married to Dr. Stanley Goldman, who died in 1942. They had a daughter, Alexandra, who died in 1954. Miss Simon was also married to Robert Simon, a publisher, until their divorce in 1960.         Survivors, besides her brother, who is a public health officer for the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, include nieces and a nephew.         A memorial service is to be scheduled soon in Manhattan.       
        Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Miss Lehmann's first novel, ''Dusty Answer,'' won immediate fame for the young author when it was published in 1927. The novel, about a girl's development from childhood to maturity, was praised for its candor, wit and psychological insight as well as for its lyrical, sensuous writing.         She followed this with ''A Note of Music'' in 1930, ''Invitation to the Waltz'' in 1932, ''The Weather in the Streets'' in 1936, ''The Ballad and the Source'' in 1944 and ''The Gypsy's Baby,'' a collection of short stories, in 1946.         Two Sisters, One Lover         Her next book was ''The Echoing Grove,'' about the relationship between two sisters and the man who is the husband of one and the lover of the other.         With shifts of time and approach, the same incidents in the book are seen through the eyes of different people.         The book was written after the bitter breakup of Miss Lehmann's love affair with the poet Cecil Day Lewis, and critics said it carried clear traces of that time in her life.         The soft-voiced author grew up in a large, comfortable home at Bourne End on the Thames near London. She was educated at Cambridge University.         Married 2 Future Lords         She met her first husband, Walter Runciman, who was later to become Lord Runciman, at Cambridge University. They married in 1923 and were divorced in 1928.         Later in 1928, she married Wogan Philipps, the eldest son of the first Lord Milford, the shipping magnate. They had two children, Hugo and Sally. That marriage ended in divorce in 1944.         Her grief over the death of her daughter from polio led her to spiritualism for a time. For many of her later years she was vice president of the privately financed College of Psychic Studies in London.         Toward the end of Miss Lehmann's life, the Virago Press, which specializes in works by women, republished many of her novels, introducing her work to a new generation of readers.         Queen Elizabeth II awarded Miss Lehmann the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982.         She is survived by her son, Hugo.       
        Josephine Johnson, a novelist and nature writer whose first novel, ''Now in November,'' won the 1935 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, died of pneumonia on Tuesday in Clearmont Mercy Hospital, Batavia, Ohio. She was 79 years old and lived in Mount Carmel, Ohio.         Josephine Johnson, a novelist and nature writer whose first novel, ''Now in November,'' won the 1935 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, died of pneumonia on Tuesday in Clearmont Mercy Hospital, Batavia, Ohio. She was 79 years old and lived in Mount Carmel, Ohio.         Miss Johnson wrote 10 books of fiction, poetry and essays. ''The Inland Island,'' published in 1969, is a month-by-month record of nature's year on her 37-acre farm in Ohio. It was praised by Edward Abbey in The New York Times for its ''delicate marvels, compassionate observations and - strangest and lovliest of all - passionate denunciations.'' The work has been credited with helping to popularize ecological concerns.         Miss Johnson's other books were ''Year's End'' (1937), ''Wildwood'' (1946), ''Jordanstown'' (1937), ''Winter Orchard and Other Stories'' (1935), ''The Sorcerer's Son and Other Stories'' (1965), ''The Dark Traveler'' (1963), ''Seven Houses: A Memoir of Time and Places'' (1973) and ''Circle of Seasons'' (1974).         In an essay in The New York Times in 1969, Miss Johnson wrote angrily of those she saw as despoilers of the environment: ''A vast throng of people are working night and day, destroying all they still call their native land. Who are these people. . . . Who pollutes the air? Who cuts down the trees, builds houses on the stripped hillsides? Who poisons the sheep, shoots the deer, oils the beaches, dams and rivers, dries up the swamps, concretes the counyrysides?''         In recent years Miss Johnson wrote for Country Journal, McCall's and Ohio Magazine.         She married Grant G. Cannon, editor in chief of the Farm Quarterly, in 1942. He died in 1969. Miss Johnson is survived by two daughters, Annie Cannon of Camptonville, Calif., and Carol Cannon of Philadelphia; a son, Terrence Cannon of Hoboken, N.J., and two sisters, Majorie McConnell of Fanwood, N.J., and Florence Johnson of St. Louis.       
        Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Ms. Capitman, who had lived in Miami since 1973, applied her talents to arouse renewed interest in 1920's and 1930's buildings throughout the country. Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building are among the best examples of Art Deco.         ''My whole life had been Art Deco,'' she once said. ''I was born at the beginning of the period and grew up during the height of it. It's a thing of fate.''         Headed a Preservation League         In 1976 she helped to found the Miami Design Preservation League, which in 1979 won Federal historic designation for the South Beach district of Miami Beach. Her outspoken, unorthodox manner later led to her ouster from the group.         ''She would push and agitate and cause trouble until people wouldn't speak to her,'' said Michael Kinerk, chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival. ''She was interested in results, not social sensitivities.''         The South Beach district is now on the National Register of Historic Places, the only 20th-century district on the register. That status brought Federal tax relief to what had been a depressed area. It is now enjoying an economic and cultural rebirth.         Chapters in Other Towns         Mrs. Capitman, president of the Art Deco Society of America, helped found chapters of the society in several cities, including New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. She was the author of ''Deco Delights'' (1989; E. P. Dutton).         She was born in Chicago and attended New York University. She later wrote advertising copy and was a reporter for The Atlantic City Daily World, which has ceased publication.         Her husband, William Capitman, died in 1975. He was a market researcher and economist and in later years a teacher at Florida International University.         Mrs. Capitman leaves two sons, Andrew W., who lives in London, and John A., who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''         The Legend of Gosta Berling         1924         The Street of Sorrow         1925         Flesh and the Devil         1927         Love         1927         A Woman of Affairs         1929         Anna Christie         1930         Susan Lenox, Her Fall and Rise         1931         Mata Hari         1931         Grand Hotel         1932         As You Desire Me         1932         Queen Christina         1933         The Painted Veil         1934         Anna Karenina         1935         Camille         1936         Conquest         1937         Ninotchka         1939         Two Faced Woman         1942       
        Bella Spewack, co-author with her late husband, Samuel, of a string of wacky comedies for Broadway and film - including such hits as ''Boy Meets Girl'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Kiss Me, Kate'' - died Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         Bella Spewack, co-author with her late husband, Samuel, of a string of wacky comedies for Broadway and film - including such hits as ''Boy Meets Girl'' and the Tony Award-winning ''Kiss Me, Kate'' - died Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         ''She was an original,'' said Lois Elias, a friend of Mrs. Spewack for 30 years. Mrs. Spewack had no survivors. Her husband died in 1971.  ''She never thought like other people,'' Mrs. Elias said. ''She was witty, sharp, but with a quixotic approach to life, a great concern for others.'' At the same time, Mrs. Elias added, ''She was a very good businesswoman; the one who made all the arrangements for the productions.''         Mrs. Spewack, whose maiden name was Bella Cohen, was born in the Transylvania region of what is now Romania, and brought to the United States as an infant.         Radical, Pacifist Views         Growing up on the East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Spewack graduated from Washington Irving High School in 1917. She soon went job hunting, but was turned down time after time as she sought any job available, preferably at a newspaper.         Eventually, the Yorkville Home News hired her as a writer and, soon after, her radical, pacifist views brought her to The New York Call, a socialist newspaper.         Her work apparently caught the attention of Samuel Spewack, then a young reporter for The World. ''Sam really fell in love with my writing,'' Mrs. Spewack said at the time of her husband's death. The Spewacks were married in 1922 and, after spending several years together as correspondents in Moscow, they launched a writing collaboration that eventually spanned four decades.         Their comedy was almost always madcap, verging on slapstick and knock-about farce. It was often peopled by the harassed, the rattle-brained, the blunder-prone and the pompous, among other cartoon-like characters.         Names Up in Lights         Almost every other year, from the 1930's through the 1950's, the names of Spewack works went up in lights on Broadway: ''Clear All Wires,'' in 1932; ''Spring Song,'' in 1934; ''Boy Meets Girl,'' in 1935; ''Leave It to Me,'' in 1938; ''Two Blind Mice'' and ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' both in 1949, and ''My Three Angels,'' in 1953.         Among the movies written by the Spewacks were ''The Nuisance,'' ''Three Loves Has Nancy,'' ''The Gay Bride,'' ''The Cat and the Fiddle,'' ''Weekend at the Waldorf'' and ''My Favorite Wife.''         ''Clear All Wires,'' based on their experiences as reporters in Moscow, was the Spewacks' first big break on Broadway, premiering in 1932. Six years later, it was turned into a musical under the title, ''Leave It to Me,'' with a score by Cole Porter. The show, which included the song, ''My Heart Belongs to Daddy,'' introduced a new young star to Broadway - Mary Martin.         In ''Boy Meets Girl,'' which opened in New York on Nov. 27, 1935, and ran for 669 performances, the Spewacks wrote about a fictional writing team, Benson and Law. The script included an exchange that has slipped into common usage.         'Boy Meets Girl'         ''Listen,'' Benson says. ''I've been writing stories for 11 years. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl.''         ''Kiss Me Kate,'' a takeoff of Shakespeare's ''Taming of the Shrew,'' with a score by Mr. Porter, ran for 1,077 performances in New York and won a Tony Award, as well as a Page One Award, for the Spewacks in 1949. The critic, Brooks Atkinson, wrote that ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' had ''the best musical comedy book of the year.''         The Spewacks had their share of flops. But, in 1955, on the night after a play called ''Festival'' received a chilly reception from the critics, Mrs. Spewack - a tiny, round woman -fought back. She marched onto the stage during curtain calls and appealed to the audience to go tell their friends if they liked the show.         ''Having a failure isn't such a dreadful thing,'' she told an interviewer. ''But 'Festival' is a good, clean show, and when I heard the audience laughing and applauding, I felt it must be something they wanted.''         Mrs. Spewack then went on a dozen radio and television programs, defending ''Festival.'' And the show was extended, if only for several more weeks.       
        Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         Sarah Vaughan, a singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz, died of lung cancer on Tuesday at her home in the Los Angeles suburb of Hidden Hills. She was 66 years old.         In a career that spanned nearly 50 years, Miss Vaughan influenced countless other singers - including Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade and Rickie Lee Jones - and made hits of such songs as ''It's Magic,'' ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' and ''Broken-Hearted Melody.'' Her ornate renditions of ''Misty'' and ''Send In the Clowns'' were invariable show-stoppers at jazz festivals in recent years, including the JVC Jazz Festival in New York, at which she appeared almost yearly.         Her voice remained remarkably unravaged by time; in her mid-60's, a period when most singers' vocal powers have sharply diminished, she was still close to her peak. Though her speaking voice deepened and darkened in later years, her singing retained a youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre, and she could still project delicate but ringingly high coloratura passages.         Where more idiosyncratic jazz artists like Billie Holiday excelled at interpretation, Miss Vaughan was a contralto who gloried in displaying the distinctive instrumental qualities of a voice that had a comfortable three-octave range and was marked by a voluptuous, heavy vibrato. Known for her dazzling vocal leaps and swoops, she was equally adept at be-bop improvisation and singing theater songs with a symphony orchestra. Among the singers of her generation, only Ella Fitzgerald enjoyed comparable stature.         ''She had the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field,'' the singer Mel Torme said yesterday. ''So much so that I used to call her the diva. At one point, I asked her why she had never opted for an operatic career. She got kind of huffy, and said, 'Do you mean jazz isn't legit?' She was very defensive about being a jazz singer. Where someone like Benny Goodman was able to split his musical image and record Mozart concerts, she wanted to perform precisely where she was.''         Appropriate Nicknames         Throughout her career, Miss Vaughan was affectionately known as Sassy or the Divine Sarah. The first nickname reflected her sense of humor and the mischievous sexiness that often inflected her singing and stage patter. The second, appropriated from the legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt, acknowledged her phenomenonally versatile voice. Foremost among the singers Miss Vaughan admired was the soprano Leontyne Price, to whom she bore more than a passing vocal resemblance.         John S. Wilson, in a New York Times review of a Vaughan performance in 1957, credited the singer with ''what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.''         When Miss Vaughan appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in 1974 as part of the Newport Jazz Festival, Mr. Wilson commented on the ''soaring highs and incredibly full lows'' she displayed in her opening numbers and summed up the conclusion of her concert as ''totally virtuosic.''         Sarah Lois Vaughan was born in Newark, on March 27, 1924. Her father was a carpenter and amateur guitarist and her mother a laundress and church vocalist. She studied the piano from the age of 7 and later took up the organ, and at age 12 she became the organist at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Newark, where she was also a soloist in the choir.         Career Began on a Dare         She also enjoyed performing popular tunes at parties, and when friends urged her to enter an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater in New York, she took the dare and won first prize in October 1942, singing ''Body and Soul.'' The singer Billy Eckstine heard her perform, and six months after winning the contest she was hired at his recommendation as a second pianist and singer with Earl (Fatha) Hines's big band, in which Mr. Eckstine was a vocalist and Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were instrumentalists.         The following year, when Mr. Eckstine formed his own band - which featured Mr. Parker, Mr. Gillespie, Art Blakey and Miles Davis, among other jazz greats - Miss Vaughan went along, and remained with him for a year. After a two-month stint in John Kirby's jazz group in the winter of 1945-46, she began a solo career. Her early solo recordings - on which she performed songs like ''Lover Man'' in full-blown be-bop style, accompanied by Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie -helped establish her reputation as a jazz singer.         First Husband Was Her Manager         During an extended engagement at Cafe Society Downtown in New York City, Miss Vaughan met George Treadwell, a trumpet player, whom she married. He became her manager, and under his guidance she made the transition from jazz cult figure to popular singing star.         She had her first hit in late 1947 with ''Tenderly,'' for the small Musicraft label. The following year, her version of ''It's Magic,'' a song from the movie ''Romance on the High Seas,'' established her as a full-fledged pop star. In 1949, she signed a five-year contract with Columbia Records, where she remained until 1954, recording mostly popular songs backed by studio orchestras. Out of more than a dozen hits she had on Columbia, the most successful was ''These Things I Offer You,'' in 1951. Although most of her Columbia hits were disposable pop confections, she also recorded many lasting standards. Columbia recently reissued a collection of 28 songs she recorded between 1949 and 1953.         When Miss Vaughan moved to the Mercury label in 1954, she was given the freedom to pursue a dual career as both a popular and jazz singer. For EmArcy, Mercury's jazz subsidiary, she recorded with Clifford Brown, Cannonball Adderley and members of Count Basie's Orchestra, among other jazz artists. On the parent label, she also scored a steady succession of hits for the rest of the decade.         Songs of Seduction         Two of her biggest successes, ''Make Yourself Comfortable'' (1954) and ''Whatever Lola Wants'' (1955), from the Broadway musical ''Damn Yankees,'' were songs of seduction in which her almost overripe timbre gave an extra edge of sensuality to come-hither messages. Her two other biggest hits were the title song of the Broadway show ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956) and ''Broken-Hearted Melody'' (1959), a ballad with a light rock-and-roll beat. Her complete output for Mercury -263 cuts - was recently reissued.         After 1959, Miss Vaughan would never have any commercially significant pop hits. But over the next 30 years, her reputation as consummate vocal artist soared steadily, thanks to her appearances in nightclubs, at jazz festivals and increasingly with symphony orchestras in the United States and abroad.         During the 1960's, she recorded briefly with Roulette, then again with Mercury and Columbia, and in the 70's and early 80's she made albums for Mainstream and Pablo. It was for Pablo, run by the jazz producer Norman Granz, that she recorded the most critically acclaimed album of her career, ''How Long Has This Been Going On?'' in which she sang with a group that included Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown.         The singer's later recordings ranged from an album of Beatles tunes to a collection of Brazilian pop songs. On CBS's classical crossover recording of ''South Pacific,'' she sang the role of Bloody Mary, and on Quincy Jones's all-star pop-jazz album, ''Back on the Block,'' she and Ella Fitzgerald sang together on a version of Josef Zawinul's ''Birdland.'' In 1982 she won a Grammy for best jazz vocal performance, for her ''Gershwin Live!'' recording on CBS.         Two Perennial Offerings         Though Miss Vaughan's repertory during her 1980's appearances at the JVC Festival varied from year to year, two songs she would always perform were ''Misty,'' which she had first recorded in 1957 with Mr. Jones, and ''Send In the Clowns,'' which became her musical signature during the last decade of her life.         Living up to her Sassy sobriquet, the singer liked to perform ''Misty'' as a duet with herself, singing the first half in her regular voice, than dipping to the bottom of her contralto to do an amusing imitation of a seductive male lounge singer. ''Send In the Clowns,'' the song that usually closed her shows, became her ultimate vocal showpiece, a three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression. The performances invariably won standing ovations.         Mr. Jones, who first worked with Miss Vaughan in Paris in 1957 when they recorded the original vocal rendition of ''Misty,'' had recently signed her to record a Brazilian fusion album on his label, Qwest. ''Sarah was the most musical singer America has ever known,'' Mr. Jones said yesterday.         Miss Vaughan's marriage to Mr. Treadwell ended in divorce, as did her marriages to Clyde Atkins, a professional football player; Marshall Fisher, a Las Vegas restaurateur, and Waymon Reed, a trumpet player.         She is survived by her mother, Ada, and a daughter, Deborah Vaughan, who uses the first name Paris for her acting career. Both live in Los Angeles.         Miss Vaughan's body will be flown to Newark for a funeral service on Saturday at Mount Zion Baptist Church.

        Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         In 1979, when she was 83 and was being honored in an exhibition of 10 outstanding 20th-century female photographers, she told an interviewer: ''If it had come 20 years ago, I might have been able to appreciate it. Now it's a strain. I have too much else to do.''         Mrs. Jacobi made her portraits in Germany and the United States over six decades. Her subjects included Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, the Soviet director Konstantin Stanislavsky, the theologian and philosopher Martin Buber, the actor and singer Paul Robeson, the poets Marianne Moore, W. H. Auden and Robert Frost, the cellist Pablo Casals, and the writers W. E. B. DuBois and Thomas Mann.         Miss Jacobi's portrait of the writer Theodore Dreiser is currently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, which has several Jacobi portraits in its collection, as do other museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Fourth Generation in the Art         Though best known for her portraits, between 1946 and 1955 she made a notable series of photo abstractions called ''Photogenics,'' experiments with light and shadow. She also photographed street scenes in New York, nature scenes in New Hampshire, and people and landscapes in the Soviet Union, Central Asia and her native Germany.         Miss Jacobi was born in Thorn, West Prussia. Her great-grandfather, Samuel Jacobi, learned photography from Louis Daguerre, who gave his name to an early picture-making process. Her grandfather and father took up the camera in turn, and as a beginner she was encouraged to start out by making her own camera.         In Berlin she eventually specialized, photographing personalities in the arts, theater and dance. She moved to New York in 1935 and opened a studio with her sister, Ruth. She moved to Deering in 1955 and continued working actively through the 1970's. In 1981 she donated her archives, consisting of 47,000 negatives, to the University of New Hampshire.         She is survived by her sister, Ruth, who lives in a nursing home in Mission Viejo, Calif.       
        Cecil Johnson Roberts, a patron of the arts and a colorful liberal in conservative Alabama, died yesterday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., after suffering an embolism. She was 76 years old.         Cecil Johnson Roberts, a patron of the arts and a colorful liberal in conservative Alabama, died yesterday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., after suffering an embolism. She was 76 years old.         Mrs. Roberts, a transplanted Englishwoman married to a member of one of the city's leading families, became the cultural leader of Birmingham after World War II. She revived the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and helped found the the Birmingham Civic Theater, which later became the University of Alabama-Birmingham Town and Gown Theater. She was the president for the theater for 30 years.         In the mid-1960's she helped integrate the audience for the performing arts in Alabama when she and her husband escorted the city's most visible civil rights leader, Dr. John Nixon, and his wife, Ethel, down the aisle before a performance at the Municipal Auditorium.         Mrs. Roberts and a friend, James Hatcher, founded the Alabama State Council on the Arts and Humanities in 1966, and she won appointment from Gov. George C. Wallace as chairman in 1971.  She took an active interest in Democratic Party politics and advocated voting rights for blacks in Alabama.         She is survived by her husband, David Roberts 3d; two sons, David Roberts 4th and Robin Watson Roberts, both of Birmingham; two brothers, three sisters and two grandchildren.       
        Marguerite Stitt Church, an Illinois Republican who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1950 to 1962, died in her sleep on Saturday at her home in Evanston, Ill. She was 97 years old.         Marguerite Stitt Church, an Illinois Republican who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1950 to 1962, died in her sleep on Saturday at her home in Evanston, Ill. She was 97 years old.         In 1950, Mrs. Church won the 13th Congressional seat formerly held by her husband, Ralph E. Church, a lawyer, who died in March of that year. In his 14 years in the House, she was closely associated with him in political campaigns and in legislative programs.         In her 12 years in Congress, Mrs. Church introduced measures to carry out recommendations of the Hoover Commissions for efficiency and economy in Government.         She was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Government Operations Committee. In 1959, as the ranking Republican member of a subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy, she traveled more than 40,000 miles in 17 countries.         She sponsored legislation, later enacted, to prohibit transporting fireworks into any state where they are illegal.         Marguerite Stitt Church was a native New Yorker who graduated from Wellesley College in 1914, Phi Beta Kappa. She received an M.A. in political science from Columbia University in 1917.         In 1918, she married Mr. Church and moved to Evanston, where she was active in welfare and social service organizations.         Mrs. Church was a trustee of the National College of Education, a member of the American Association of University Women and former president of the National Alumnae Association of Wellesley College.         She is survived by a daughter, Marjory Barnum of Northfield, Ill,; two sons, Ralph E. Jr. of Vero Beach, Fla., and William of Chicago; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Esther V. Foley, the director of the women's athletic program at New York University from 1951 to 1971, died on Monday at her home in Katonah, N.Y., after a long illness. She was 85 years old.         Esther V. Foley, the director of the women's athletic program at New York University from 1951 to 1971, died on Monday at her home in Katonah, N.Y., after a long illness. She was 85 years old.         Miss Foley, who won the women's national amateur platform diving championship as an undergraduate in 1927, was a coach of many women's sports teams at N.Y.U. from 1929 until her retirement in 1971. They included field hockey, swimming and diving, basketball, volleyball and tennis.         In 1976 she was inducted into the N.Y.U. Women's Athletic Hall of Fame.         She was born in Sanborn, Iowa, and studied at Northwestern University before earning a bachelor's degree from N.Y.U. in 1928.         She left no survivors.       
        Hope Williams, a debutante with a carefree manner, boyishly clipped blond hair and a humorous walk, who was a leading Broadway actress in the late 1920's and 30's, died of cardiac arrest last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Hope Williams, a debutante with a carefree manner, boyishly clipped blond hair and a humorous walk, who was a leading Broadway actress in the late 1920's and 30's, died of cardiac arrest last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Miss Williams, whose sole acting training was in amateur plays, gained notice in a Philip Barry comedy in 1927, ''Paris Bound,'' and won Broadway over as a rebellious socialite in ''Holiday,'' the classic comedy of manners in 1928 that Barry wrote for her.         The enthusiasm of reviewers and audiences was reflected in this appraisal by Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times: ''Miss Williams is one of the most clearheaded comediennes we have. She plays quietly with a sort of comic incandescence that is one of the superlative delights of this season. Through all the turns of the play she remains very much herself - boyishly awkward but quick and sparkling.''         Years later, Katharine Hepburn, who had understudied Miss Williams on Broadway and recreated the ''Holiday'' role in the 1938 movie that also starred Cary Grant, offered this tribute: ''I stole a great deal from Hope. She was the first fascinating personality from that period, 1929 to 1932, which wasn't really ready for her. She was a woman who blossomed with a little more than she was supposed to.''         Well-Bred Foil         Over seven years, Miss Williams was generally hailed in a handful of productions, including two revues, ''The New Yorkers'' and ''Strike Me Pink,'' in which she played a well-bred subtle foil to the riotous buffoonery of Jimmy Durante. She was also remembered for a world-weary role in Noel Coward's 1935 film, ''The Scoundrel.''         Mr. Coward wrote in his 1940 autobiography, ''Future Indefinite,'' that Miss Williams ''had a charming speaking voice with a sort of beguiling tonelessness.''         ''She was slangy without being vulgar,'' Coward added, ''modern without being brash, and her gaucheries of movement had a peculiar grace.''         Miss Williams was born in Manhattan on Aug. 11, 1897. Her father, Waldron, was a prominent lawyer. She attended the Brearley School and Miss Porter's Classes and learned acting in the Amateur Comedy Club and Junior League charity shows.         ''Too much has been made of this Park Avenue situation,'' she told an interviewer. ''What difference does it make what side of the railroad tracks a girl comes from, so long as she has charm and looks and ability?''         Effect of World War II         Miss Williams retired from acting after playing the careless governess Miss Prism in a 1939 Broadway revival of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Earnest.''         Miss Williams told a columnist for Playbill, Rebecca Morehouse, that when When World War II began ''everything changed.''         ''I have a ranch in Wyoming, and after my manager was drafted, I had to be there,'' Miss Williams said.         She divided her time between the 1,000-acre dude ranch outside Cody and her Upper East Side apartment and for a while ran a cooking school and recorded books for the blind.         Mrs. Morehouse observed in her column in 1983 that in later decades Miss Williams socialized in Manhattan almost without notice, often attended theater and music events and regularly dined with friends, often at her club, the Colony. Asked why she never resumed acting, she thought for a moment, smiled nonchalantly and replied, ''I guess that's because I have always had a privileged life.''         Some of the privileges came from her former husband, Dr. R. Bartow Read. They were married in 1922 and divorced in 1928. He was killed in a crash of his private plane in 1931, and his will, written in 1923, named her as his sole beneficiary.         Survivors include two nephews and five nieces.       
        Mary Lea Johnson Richards, a founder and partner of the Producer Circle, a New York film and theatrical production company, died yesterday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she had a liver transplant two weeks ago. She was 63 years old and had homes in New York, Southampton, L.I., and Boca Raton,         Mary Lea Johnson Richards, a founder and partner of the Producer Circle, a New York film and theatrical production company, died yesterday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she had a liver transplant two weeks ago. She was 63 years old and had homes in New York, Southampton, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Since it was formed in 1976, the Producer Circle - founded by Mrs. Richards with her husband, Martin Richards, Robert Fryer and James Cresson - won 22 Tony Awards. It produced such Broadway shows as ''On the Twentieth Century,'' ''Sweeney Todd,'' ''La Cage aux Folles,'' ''Crimes of the Heart,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, and ''Grand Hotel.'' Its Off Broadway productions included ''March of the Falsettos'' and ''Mayor.'' Among the company's films were ''The Boys From Brazil,'' ''The Shining'' and ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.''         Mrs. Richards was born on Aug. 20, 1926, in New Brunswick, N.J. She was the oldest daughter of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, and his first wife, Ruth Dill Johnson. She was a graduate of the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Murder Plot Charged         Mrs. Richards's first marriage, to William Ryan, a farmer and a newspaper editor, ended in divorce. She made headlines in 1976 when she charged that her second husband, Dr. Victor D'Arc, a New York psychiatrist, had hired men to have her murdered. The Bronx District Attorney's office opened an investigation in the case, but no charges were ever brought. The couple was divorced in 1978.         Five years later, after the death of her father, Mrs. Richards and her brothers and sisters went to Surrogates Court in Manhattan to challenge his last will, which disinherited five of his six children and left the vast bulk of his $350 million estate to his third wife, Barbara Piasecka Johnson of Princeton. N.J. The case, the largest inheritance contest in the history of New York, went through 14 weeks of trial in 1986 before it was settled out of court, with the children dividing up about 12 percent of the total.         In addition to her husband, Martin Richards of New York, Mrs. Richards is survived by two brothers, J. Seward Johnson Jr. of Princeton, and James L. Johnson of Pottersville, N.J.; three sisters, Diana Firestone of Waterford, Va., Elaine Wold of Boca Raton and Jennifer Duke of Jacksonville, Fla.; five sons, Eric Ryan of New York; Seward, Hillary and Quentin Ryan of Hilton Head, S.C., and Roderick Ryan, of Andover, N.J.; one daughter, Alice Ryan Marriott, also of Hilton Head; and 10 grandchildren.       
        Ina Balin, a film and stage actress whose adoption of three Vietnamese orphans was dramatized in a 1980 television movie in which she played herself, died yesterday at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 52 years old and lived in Westport, Conn.         Ina Balin, a film and stage actress whose adoption of three Vietnamese orphans was dramatized in a 1980 television movie in which she played herself, died yesterday at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 52 years old and lived in Westport, Conn.         A spokesman for the hospital said Ms. Balin died of complications of chronic lung disease.         Ms. Balin became associated with a Saigon orphanage, An Lac, in 1970, when she visited it while touring with a U.S.O. show.         Five years later, in the final days of the Vietnam War, she and an another American, Betty Tisdale, helped evacuate children from the orphanage to the United States, and Ms. Balin, who was unmarried, adopted three girls. Two were infants; the other was a 16-year-old who was hidden aboard an evacuation plane, the actress said, because she was half black and so faced a dismal future in South Vietnam.         ''Adopting those children was the best thing I've ever done in my whole life,'' the Brooklyn-born actress told an interviewer shortly before her story was told on CBS in ''The Children of An Lac.'' ''It gives you a whole other perspective on life. It gets you involved with someone other than yourself, because children truly need you.''         Praised in Broadway Debut         Ms. Balin won critical praise for her Broadway debut in 1957 in ''Compulsion''; Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times said her portrayal of a convict's friend was ''tenderly moving.'' In 1959, she appeared in ''A Majority of One'' as the daughter of a housewife played by Gertrude Berg.         That year Ms. Balin also made her screen debut as Anthony Quinn's daughter in ''The Black Orchid.'' Her other films included ''From the Terrace'' (1960), ''The Young Doctors'' (1961), ''The Comancheros'' (1961), ''The Patsy'' (1964), ''The Greatest Story Every Told'' (1965), ''Charro!'' (1969) and ''The Projectionist'' (1971).         Ms. Balin, who traveled widely, was also a published photographer and was the co-owner of the Balin-Traube Art Gallery in New York, which operated on East 74th Street for three years in the early 1960's.         She is survived by her father, Sam Rosenberg of Hallandale, Fla; her daughters, Ba-Nhi Mai and Kim Thuy, both of Westport, and Nguyet Baty of Berlin; a brother, Richard Balin of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.         A memorial service is scheduled for tomorrow at 11 A.M. at the Spear Funeral Home, 39 South Benson Road, Fairfield, Conn.       
        Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known sopranos in the 1960's and 1970's, died of cancer on Friday, her family said. She was 52 years old.  Miss Harwood, who died at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London, specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and in the music of Mozart.         Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known sopranos in the 1960's and 1970's, died of cancer on Friday, her family said. She was 52 years old.  Miss Harwood, who died at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London, specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and in the music of Mozart.         Her mother, a professional soprano, gave her singing lessons when she was a child, and she later studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music.         She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in ''Die Zauberflote'' by Mozart at Glyndebourne in southern England. In 1963 she scored her first major success, as Countess Adele in Rossini's ''Count Ory.'' In 1960, she won Britain's prized Kathleen Ferrier memorial award for singing, and in 1965 was a winner of the Verdi Competition at Busseto in Italy.         Miss Harwood first appeared at the annual music festival in Salzburg, Austria, in 1970, singing the role of Constanze in Mozart's ''Abduction From the Seraglio'' and that of Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte.'' Returning to Salzburg in 1972, she sang the countess in a new production of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' conducted by Herbert von Karajan. He continued to invite her to Salzburg for several years.         In the late 1970's Miss Harwood's health declined. Her last performance was in November 1989 at the Bath Festival in western England. She married Julian Royle, a businessman, in 1966. The couple had one son.       
        Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her stepson, John French Jr., said she had suffered a stroke while visiting relatives in the Philadelphia area.         Mrs. French was born into Philadelphia's Main Line society but spent most of her adult life in New York, where she was active in political causes and civic affairs. Although she had not held party office in the last decade, she remained influential in Democratic affairs until her death.         Last year Mrs. French devoted much of her energy to securing revision of the New York City Charter. As chairwoman of the charter committee of the Women's City Club, she lobbied for the changes that were adopted by the voters last November.         Helped Nazi Victims         Earlier this year the Unitarian Universalist Services Committee honored Mrs. French for her work in the aftermath of World War II, when she directed two rest homes in France operated by the church organization for survivors of Nazi concentration camps.         Mrs. French was most prominently in the public eye in 1964 when she tried unsuccessfully to wrest a seat in the House of Representatives from John V. Lindsay. As the Democratic-Liberal candidate in the ''Silk Stocking'' district on Manhattan's East Side, she waged a vigorous campaign but lost, receiving less than 25 percent of the vote.         Two years earlier she had been appointed New York City's first Commissioner to the United Nations, a post she held until her race for Congress.         Mrs. French was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions, from 1964 through 1980, and was vice chairwoman of the state party from 1957 to 1960.         She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which she found progressive. But at 14, as the president of her class, she complained to the headmistress that because the school was all white she was not being prepared for the world in which she was going to live. She quoted the reply: ''My dear Ellie, we're not giving you the opportunity to make friends with Democrats either.''         A Stint as a Teacher         Mrs. French, who later became a member of the New York City Commission on Intergroup Relations, now the Commission on Human Rights, studied at the Sorbonne and at Harvard and Columbia.         In 1932, after her father, Herbert Lincoln Clark, a stockbroker, lost a fortune in the Depression, she returned to Shipley as a teacher and later became a supervisor at the Episcopal School in Overbrook, Pa.         In World War II she served in the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington. In 1949, after returning from France, she joined the staff of The New York Times and was named women's news editor. She resigned in 1955 to become more active in politics, and the following year she ran for the State Senate but lost. In 1957 she was appointed vice chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee to fill a vacancy, and in 1958 she won election to the post.         But two years later, in a split with the party's top leadership, she was out, charging that she and other women had not been given a real voice in Democratic affairs in the state.         Family members said yesterday that last Thursday Mrs. French had been pleased to stand in line for two hours for the chance to meet Nelson Mandela during his New York visit.         Mrs. French's husband, John, whom she married in 1950, died in 1984. Surviving are two stepsons, John Jr., of Manhattan, and Roberts, of Amherst, Mass., and a stepdaughter, Mary Moore of Cheyenne, Wyo.         A funeral service will be held on Monday at 11 A.M. at All Souls Unitarian Church, Lexington Aveue at 80th Street.       
        Barbara Baxley, a stage, film and television actress, was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment. The medical examiner's office said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. She was 63 years old.         Barbara Baxley, a stage, film and television actress, was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment. The medical examiner's office said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. She was 63 years old.         Since her 1948 Broadway debut as a baffled bride in a revival of Noel Coward's ''Private Lives,'' starring Tallulah Bankhead and Donald Cook, Miss Baxley played a wide variety of roles in productions that ranged from Shakespeare to musical comedies.         In 1960 she played a different bride, this one from Texas, in the Tennessee Williams play ''Period of Adjustment,'' for which she received a Tony nomination.         She also won critical praise as Sally Field's mother in the 1979 film ''Norma Rae'' and again in 1981 as a business executive in Wendy Wasserstein's play ''Isn't It Romantic.'' In his review of ''Isn't It Romantic,'' Mel Gussow of The New York Times cited Miss Baxley's ''stylish personification of boardroom urbanity.''         Other Broadway Credits         Miss Baxley's other Broadway credits include ''Whodunnit'' (1983), ''The Three Sisters'' (1964), ''She Loves Me'' (1963), ''The Flowering Peach'' (1954), ''The Frogs of Spring'' (1953), ''Camino Real'' (1953) and ''Out West of Eighth'' (1951).         Early in her career, she filled in for Jean Arthur in ''Peter Pan'' and took over Julie Harris's role in ''I Am a Camera.''         Off Broadway, she sang Brecht-Weill songs in ''Brecht on Brecht'' (1962) and appeared in ''To Be Young, Gifted and Black'' (1969).         She played Isabel in ''Measure for Measure,'' a New York Shakespeare Festival production in Central Park in 1966, and Portia in ''The Merchant of Venice'' at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., in 1967. At the Yale Repertory Theater she had the title roles in ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' and ''Major Barbara.''         She starred in the national companies of ''Zorba,'' ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' and the Kennedy Center Bicentennial production of ''Scarecrow.'' In Chicago she co-starred with George Grizzard in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and Moliere's ''Misanthrope.''         Miss Baxley's films included ''Nashville'' (1975), ''Countdown'' (1968), ''No Way to Treat a Lady'' (1968), ''All Fall Down'' (1962) and ''The Savage Eye'' (1960).         As Television Guest         Her many guest appearances on television included ''Murder, She Wrote,'' ''Hawaii Five-O,'' ''The Hitchcock Hour,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90.'' In the Norman Lear series ''All That Glitters,'' she played the industrialist L. W. Carruthers.         Miss Baxley, born in Stockton, Calif., graduated with honors in speech and history from the College of the Pacific in Stockton and won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, where she studied with Sanford Meisner. She was also a charter member of the Actors Studio, where she studied with Elia Kazan.         Miss Baxley received honors including the Actors Studio Award for achievement in 1980.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
        Alison Leggatt, an actress who won renown in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter, died on Sunday, her family said today. She was 86 years old.         Alison Leggatt, an actress who won renown in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter, died on Sunday, her family said today. She was 86 years old.         Alison Joy Seetah Leggatt became an actress against the wishes of her well-to-do parents. Her mother refused ever to see her act, considering the stage unsuitable for a well-bred young woman.         Her performance in 1927 in ''The Fanatics'' by Miles Malleson established her as one of the most promising theatrical newcomers of her generation.         During the 1930's, she appeared in Noel Coward's ''Cavalcade,'' playing a honeymooning wife on the Titanic just before it struck the iceberg. She also acted in plays by Clifford Bax and J. B. Priestley.         After World War II, she was Lavinia in T. S. Eliot's ''Cocktail Party'' with Rex Harrison and Margaret Leighton, and Mrs. Guzzard in Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.'' She played the emotionally restrained landlady in ''Epitaph for George Dillon,'' by Mr. Osborne and Anthony Creighton, in London and New York. In the early 1960's she was Flora in Mr. Pinter's ''Slight Ache.''         Although her theater career ended in the late 1960's, she continued to appear on television and had movie roles in ''Far From the Madding Crowd,'' ''Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.''       
        Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Houlton died of breast cancer, her family said.         At a Congressional reception in 1985, Mrs. Houlton, who wrote under her maiden name, Peggy Mann, was honored as one of the nation's foremost authors of books and articles about preventing drug abuse. Her ''Marijuana Alert'' (1985), about drug-abuse prevention for adults, was based on an article she wrote for the Reader's Digest in 1979.         Many of Mrs. Houlton's books were for teen-agers and younger children. These include ''Arrive Alive: How to Keep Drunk and Drugged Drivers Off the Road'' and ''Twelve Is Too Old,'' a novel about tobacco and marijuana.         Mrs. Houlton was born in Manhattan, and was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Her first novel for adults, ''A Room in Paris,'' which was published in 1955, is about the lives and loves of a young American art student in France.         A TV Special         Some of her other books include ''Golda,'' a biography of Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel; ''The Last Escape,'' about a woman's mission to smuggle Jews out of Nazi-occupied Europe into Palestine; ''My Dad Lives in a Downtown Hotel,'' and ''The Street of the Flower Boxes.'' ''The Street of the Flower Boxes'' inspired an NBC television special in the 1970's that won a Peabody Award and that inspired a movement for neighborhood beautification.         The National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth recently established the Peggy Mann Scholarship Award for Outstanding Youth Involved in Substance-Use Prevention. Beginning next year, annual $1,000 college scholarships are to be given to students from each of the 50 states, Guam and Puerto Rico who have made distinguished contributions to their community and school-based drug-prevention programs.         She is survived by her husband, William, and two daughters, Jenny and Betsy Houlton, all of New York City and Fair Harbor, L.I.; a brother, John Mann of Conesus, N.Y., and her mother, Edna Mann of New York City.         Funeral services are to be held today at 10:30 A.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.

A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint.

        Kathleen McLaughlin, a newspaper reporter for 44 years who won recognition as a political correspondent in the 1940's and 50's, died on Friday at a nursing home in Park Ridge, Ill. She was 92 years old.         Kathleen McLaughlin, a newspaper reporter for 44 years who won recognition as a political correspondent in the 1940's and 50's, died on Friday at a nursing home in Park Ridge, Ill. She was 92 years old.         During a 33-year career with The New York Times, she was the newspaper's women's editor, a member of the Washington bureau and a foreign correspondent in Bonn. She covered the Nuremberg trials before writing about the United Nations and switching to business news until her retirement in 1968.         After arriving in Washington during the Roosevelt years, she became one of the small inner circle of women reporters covering the activities of Eleanor Roosevelt. At the United Nations, she won the trust of many diplomats and became known for perceptive writing about emerging third-world countries.         Her newspaper career began at The Daily Globe in Atchison, Kan., in 1924. She was the recipient of many awards, including three from the New York Newspaper Women's Club.         She is survived by a brother, Thomas, and 10 nieces and nephews.       
        Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Marya Mannes, an author, journalist and critic, died Thursday at Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco. She was 85 years old.         Her son, David R. J. Blow, said she had died after suffering a series of strokes this week at the hospital, a geriatric facility that she entered in March. She had lived in various residences for the elderly, mainly in California, since 1983, after residing most of her earlier life in Manhattan.         The versatile Ms. Mannes was a social critic and a critic of radio, television and theater. She worked as a staff writer for the magazine The Reporter from 1952 to 1963. Her writing there included articles, essays and reviews. She even wrote satirical verse, under the pen name ''Sec.''         She did much writing over the years for The New Yorker and for other publications ranging from McCalls to The New York Times, and was the author of several books.         More Than Outspoken         Ms. Mannes's 1958 collection of essays - largely from The Reporter -was contentiously titled ''More in Anger: Some Opinions, Uncensored and Unteleprompted.'' William du Bois, reviewing it in The New York Times, said that ''to call these pages outspoken is putting things mildly.'' The book, he continued, ''is guaranteed to shock you into awareness of its author as an original thinker.''         ''Whether she is writing of the Rheingold girls or the boys in Washington,'' he observed, ''of social-minded mothers and their child victims, of the world of Miltown or the think-room at the United Nations, of the 'half-people' of our automotive age or the heirs of Senator McCarthy, she hews to the line and lets the quips fall where they may.''         For some years, Ms. Mannes was seen often on television, but she was a champion of the written word. In a speech to a gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, she once said, ''No picture on a screen can ever be an adequate substitute for the reporting of a trained observer and an honest writer.''         Marya Mannes was born on Nov. 14, 1904, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her parents were David Mannes and the former Clara Damrosch - founders of the Mannes College of Music.         She grew up in Manhattan, graduating in 1923 from Miss Veltin's School for Girls. Instead of going to college, she went to Europe for two years and studied sculpture, mainly in England.         She went on to do varied writing - including a play, ''Cafe,'' that failed on Broadway in 1930. From 1933 to 1936, she worked for Vogue magazine, as an associate editor and later as feature editor.         Wartime Analyst         During part of World War II, she was an intelligence analyst with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, she did much free-lance writing in addition to her work on The Reporter. Over the decades, 329 articles with her byline were published - 275 of them in The Reporter.         In later years she appeared on various televison programs. The Times television critic Jack Gould wrote in 1961 that ''her sustained acerbity is one of the attractive adornments of contemporary criticism.'' She also lectured across the country.         Her books include ''Out of My Time'' (1971), an autobiography; ''Message From a Stranger'' (1948) and ''They'' (1968) - both novels - and ''Subverse: Rhymes for Our Times'' (1959), a volume of satiric verse.         She was also a co-author of ''Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart'' (1972), a book about divorce. ''The Best of Marya Mannes,'' an anthology of her writing edited by Robert Mottley, was published in 1986.         In 1958 she won the George Polk Memorial Award, one of many honors given for her writing.         Her three marriages - to the set designer Jo Melziener, to Richard A. Blow, an artist, and to Christopher Clarkson, a representative of British companies - ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, who lives in San Francisco.       
        Irene Dunne had a ladylike gentility that made her naughty antics in sophisticated comedies all the more hilarious. In classic farces like ''The Awful Truth,'' in which she portrayed a worldly divorcee briefly inpersonating a gauche chorine, she delighted audiences and reviewers with her wit and elan.         Critics agreed that her artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. Miss Dunne was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and longtime popularity, an Oscar eluded her.         Colleagues regarded her as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., once a co-star, wrote that she was ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         Studied Music         Of Irish descent, Irene Dunne was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec 20. The year was 1904, according to most sources. Her father was a supervisory steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, an accomplished pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended a convent school, studied voice and piano with private teachers, sang in a church choir, attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and, after winning an arduous contest, was given a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors.         After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected for being, Miss Dunne recalled, ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in a number of minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, a milestone year, she was cast in the leading role of Magnolia for what became a hugely successful 72-week tour of Florenz Ziegfeld's production of ''Show Boat.''         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after a minor picture called ''Leathernecking'' and six months of drama lessons, she won the leading role of Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.''         Miss Dunne was cast for several years in such tragic and lachrymose roles as a hanidcapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a hugely popular tearjerker; a troubled wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she challenged a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 30's         By the mid-30's, her rich, warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline,'' the sparkling ''Roberta,'' ''Show Boat,'' and ''High, Wide and Handsome.''         Miss Dunne chose her vehicles with great care and won even greater popularity in effervescent and urbane madcap comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a daring book and tries to live up to it.In several other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying backtalk.         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her personal favorite of her 41 films.         The actress later received accolades for two major wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was the indestructible Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's King in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family in early 20th-century San Francisco in ''I Remember Mama.''         Active in Philanthropies         Miss Dunne was miscast in her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by the makeup she wore to play a frumpy elderly Queen Victoria. Her final film was ''It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952. In the 50's, she made occasional television appearances.         As her acting career became less demanding, Miss Dunne found other pursuits, away from the film industry. An active Republican, she was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairman of many philanthropies.         Miss Dunne was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter, Mary Frances.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria. In the 1950's, she made only occasional television appearances.         As she did less acting, she turned to other pursuits. She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS. ANNA         These are among the more than 40 films made by Irene Dunne during her 22-year film career:         Cimarron (1931)         Ann Vickers (1933)         Roberta (1935)         Magnificent Obsession (1935)         Show Boat (1936)         Theodora Goes Wild (1936)         The Awful Truth (1937)         Love Affair (1939)         My Favorite Wife (1940)         A Guy Named Joe (1943)         The White Cliffs of Dover (1944)         Anna and the King of Siam (1946)         Life With Father (1947)         I Remember Mama (1948)         The Mudlark (1950)       
        Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.         Lilian Thomson Mowrer, author of books about Europe on the eve of World War II, died Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 101 years old.         With her husband, Edgar Ansel Mowrer, a Pulitizer Prize-winning foreign correspondent for The Chicago Daily News, Mrs. Mowrer was close to events in Italy during the rise of Mussolini, in Germany during the rise of Hitler and in France until it fell to the Nazis in 1940.         She and Mr. Mowrer, who won his Pulitzer in 1933, were forced by the Nazis to leave Germany the same year. He died in 1977.         Mrs. Mowrer's first book, ''Journalist's Wife,'' appeared in 1937 and was promptly banned in Germany by the Nazis. Her last book, published in 1961, was ''The Indomitable John Scott: Citizen of Long Island,'' a biography of a 17th-century Colonial adventurer.         Mrs. Mowrer, who was born in England and met her husband there in 1911, also wrote theater criticism and articles on politics for such publications as Vanity Fair and Town and Country and for British newspapers.         She is survived by her daughter, Diana M. Beliard, of Chicago, and a granddaughter.       
        Marguerite Falkenburg Wagstaff, a painter and a former tennis champion in Brazil, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old. She died of pneumonia, her family said. Mrs. Wagstaff, who was known as Mickey, met her first husband, Eugene Falkenburg, on a tennis court in Spain, where he was chief engineer for Westinghouse.         Marguerite Falkenburg Wagstaff, a painter and a former tennis champion in Brazil, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old. She died of pneumonia, her family said. Mrs. Wagstaff, who was known as Mickey, met her first husband, Eugene Falkenburg, on a tennis court in Spain, where he was chief engineer for Westinghouse. They were married in Barcelona and their daughter, Eugenia, the model and television personality known as Jinx, was born there.         The family moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she won the state tennis championship in 1927. Her sons Tom and Bob each won the United States Junior Championship twice and Bob was the Wimbledon champion in 1948.         After the death of her first husband, she married LeRoy Wagstaff, a retired chief engineer for American Home Products. A prolific artist, she had a studio in Southamption, L.I., where she became known for floral motifs. She produced more than 5,000 paintings that carry her signature, Mic.         She is survived by her daughter, Jinx, of Manhasset, L.I.; sons, Tom, of Stuart, Fla., and Bob, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Colette Audry, a prize-winning novelist, screenwriter and critic, died on Saturday at Issy-les-Moulineaux southwest of Paris, her family reported. She was 84 years old.         No cause of death was given.         Miss Audry received wide acclaim in 1946 for her screenplay for the film "The Battle for the Railway," an account of French rail workers' resistance to the Nazi Occupation, and she won the Medicis Prize, a top French literary award, in 1962 for her autobiographical novel "Behind the Bathtub."         Miss Audry was born in Orange in southern France. She taught letters at the Lycee Moliere in Paris and was an accomplished literary critic, especially on the works of the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. She collaborated with Sartre on the Revue des Temps Modernes, wrote several books and plays, and directed the Editions Denoel publishing house.         She wrote the screenplays for several films directed by her sister Jacqueline, including "Sophie's Unhappiness" in 1946 and "Bitter Fruit," which won the Grand Prix of French Cinema, in 1966.         Miss Audry ran as a Socialist candidate for the National Assembly in 1962 and 1967 and served on the party steering committee from 1971 to 1981.       
         Joan Brown, an artist and professor of art at the University of California at Berkeley, was killed on Friday in an accident in Proddatura, India. She was 52 years old and lived in San Francisco.         The accident occurred while Ms. Brown, who in recent years was known for her use of imagery from ancient cultures, was installing her work in a reflecting pool at the new Heritage Museum, still under construction at Proddatura. Colleagues at the University of California said a concrete turret from a balcony collapsed and fell on her.         Starting out in the mid-1960's as a figurative painter in the thickly pigmented style of the so-called second-generation Bay Area artists, Ms. Brown gradually lightened her mode of painting and concentrated on imagery drawn from her personal life. A long-distance swimmer who regarded the sport as a means of meditation, she at this time used many images of swimmers in her art. Student of World Cultures         In the early 1970's she began traveling, informally studying world cultures. She drew inspiration for her work from the Egyptian and Hindu religions, and she made obelisks adorned with decorative patterns incorporating symbolic animal and human forms. In recent years, because of political and moral objections to the sale of art, she became involved in public art projects and made an effort to withdraw her work from the market.         Born and brought up in San Francisco, Ms. Brown attended the California School of Fine Arts -- later to become the San Francisco Art Institute -- from 1956 to 1960, and later received a master's degree in fine arts there, in 1962. In 1974 she joined the department of art at Berkeley, where, said Christopher Brown, the chairman of the department, she consistently won the highest rating as a teacher from faculty members and students.         Ms. Brown is survived by her husband, Michael Hebel, and a son, Noel Neri.       
        Eleanor Steber, a leading soprano at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1940's and 50's who was particularly noted for her Mozart and Strauss roles, died yesterday morning at the Attleboro Nursing Home in Langhorne, Pa. She was 76 years old. She died of congestive heart failure, said her representative, Martha Moore         Eleanor Steber, a leading soprano at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1940's and 50's who was particularly noted for her Mozart and Strauss roles, died yesterday morning at the Attleboro Nursing Home in Langhorne, Pa. She was 76 years old. She died of congestive heart failure, said her representative, Martha Moore Smith.         Miss Steber had a silvery soprano of considerable size with a pungent vibrato and impressive control of ornamentation. Her Met debut role in 1940 was Sophie in Strauss's ''Rosenkavalier,'' and she sang Strauss roles throughout her career.         She was especially admired for her Mozart heroines, moving from the lyrical (Pamina in ''Die Zauberflote'') through the more dramatic and ornamented (Constanze in ''Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail'' in that opera's Met premiere in 1946, Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' the Countess in ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' and Donna Elvira in ''Don Giovanni'') to the highly dramatic (Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni'').         At the Bayreuth Festival         Although she sang a wide range of German, Italian and French parts, she gradually assumed heavier roles in the 1950's, including the ''Rosenkavalier'' Marschallin and Elsa in Wagner's ''Lohengrin,'' which she also sang and recorded at the Bayreuth Festival in West Germany.         Miss Steber was born in Wheeling, W. Va., on July 17, 1914, two years earlier than the date published in most standard reference works, Miss Smith said. She studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and privately in New York, and won the 1940 Metropolitan Opera radio auditions, which led to her company debut.         Her Met career included 404 performances of 33 roles from 1940 to 1966. She sang the title roles in the world premiere of Samuel Barber's ''Vanessa'' in 1958 and in the American premiere of Strauss's ''Arabella'' in 1955. She also sang Marie in the Met's first performance of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' in 1959. In addition to Bayreuth, she appeared at many other European festivals, including those in Edinburgh, Vienna and Florence, and with several American companies.         As part of an active concert and recording career, she made more than 100 albums and commissioned and first performed Barber's concert aria, ''Knoxville: Summer of 1915.'' She also appeared on radio, television and, in the 1960's, in musicals.         'I Was Knocked for a Loop'         In 1962, Rudolf Bing, then general manager of the Met, declined to rehire the singer.         ''He told me I wouldn't miss the Met at all,'' Miss Steber recalled in 1973. ''I tell you, I was knocked for a loop.'' She did make one final appearance at the Met in 1966, replacing Dorothy Kirsten.         Miss Steber continued to sing into the 1970's, often appearing in duo recitals with Blanche Thebom and presenting three solo recitals in 1973 at Alice Tully Hall. That same year she also sang Miss Wingrave in the American premiere of Britten's ''Owen Wingrave'' with the Santa Fe Opera.         Her later years were primarily devoted to teaching. She was head of the voice department at the Cleveland Institute from 1963 to 1972, and taught at the Juilliard School in the 1970's and at Brooklyn College in the 1980's. In 1975, she established the Eleanor Steber Foundation to help young singers.         She is survived by a sister, Lucille Leslie of Newtown, Pa.; a brother, William C. Steber of State College, Pa., two stepdaughters and one stepson.       
        Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Mrs. Wittenberg was a familiar figure at City Hall and in other forums where she pleaded the case for preservation and against what she and her neighbors considered invasive development. She was a major force in gaining designation of the Greenwich Village Historic District two decades ago.         ''I'm kind of a landmark myself,'' Mrs. Wittenberg said in 1977 when, at the age of 79, she was honored for her many civic campaigns. She served on what is now Community Board 2 for almost four decades, having been appointed in 1951 to its predecessor, the Community Council for the Greenwich Village area, by the Manhattan Borough President, Robert F. Wagner. For many years she was chairwoman of the board's landmarks committee.         Board Meetings in Hospital         She was active in board affairs until shortly before her death. A small, energetic woman, she broke a hip in 1975 in a fall while walking on the Avenue of the Americas. Board 2's landmark committee meetings were held in her hospital room until she recovered, and in the years after that, she attended Board of Estimate and Planning Commission sessions in a wheelchair.         Born into a politically active family, she said one of her earliest memories was sitting on the knee of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist leader.         Mrs. Wittenberg was born in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College and Barnard before quitting to help support her family by working as a demographer for the Bell Telephone Company, predicting population trends for expansion of telephone service.         Jailed as a Suffragist         As a suffragist before women won the right to vote, she was twice jailed. She marched in 1965 in Selma, Ala., in a civil rights demonstration with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..         Not all her battles were victories. She led Village residents in an unsuccessful fight against New York University's plan to construct the 12-story-high Elmer A. Bobst Library on Washington Square South, which residents regarded as too bulky for the site.         Her most conspicuous victory was for demolition of the Women's House of Detention on Greenwich Avenue at Christopher Street and conversion of the site into a community garden, together with preservation of the adjacent Jefferson Market Courthouse, now a branch public library.         Mrs. Wittenberg's husband, Philip, to whom she was married in 1919, died three years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Susanna Berger of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Jonathan, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
        Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Mrs. Behrman, who was known as Madame Alexander, began designing dolls for her father, a Russian emigre, during World War I, when she began making ''Red Cross Nurse'' rag dolls. In 1923 she founded the Alexander Doll Company, in which she produced rag dolls with innovative three-dimensional facial features that she hand-painted. In the 1930's she began making dolls with lifelike details like eyes with lashes that closed and fingers with knuckles.         With the advent of plastic after World War II, she made dolls with vinyl heads and elaborate hair that could be styled. She also created designer clothing for the dolls and received international attention. In 1953, a collection of her dolls featuring, in authentic detail, Queen Elizabeth I and 35 principals at her coronation was presented to the Brooklyn Children's Museum.         In 1965, she was honored by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Arthur Goldberg, for her collection of international dolls that featured the native dress of every country represented at the U.N.         She also created dolls that portrayed characters in books and movies like Alice in Wonderland, Orphan Annie, Nancy Drew, the four sisters in ''Little Women'' and characters from Charles Dickens's books. Her ''Madame'' doll, based on the American Revolution, and her ''Scarlett O'Hara'' doll, portraying the Civil War era in ''Gone with the Wind,'' were included in the Smithsonian Institution in 1968.         She also designed children's clothing and won four Fashion Academy gold medals. Her company, which was sold two years ago to two New York businessmen, has created more than 5,000 different dolls at its factory in on West 131st Street in Harlem, where it has about 600 employees and is one of the area's largest employers. Many of the dolls have become collectors' items and sell for about $5,000.         She is survived by a daughter, Mildren Birnbaum of Purchase, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.; a grandson, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Eve Arden, the caustic comedienne featured in dozens of films as a heroine's wry and wisecracking best friend, a warmhearted but sassy schoolteacher or secretary, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The actress said she was born on April 30, 1912, but Ron Lisell, a spokesman for the family, said she was 83. Her death was caused by heart disease, Mr. Lisell said.         Miss Arden made her Broadway debut in the "Ziegfeld Follies" of 1934, but although she often appeared in plays in New York and on the road, she was chiefly a Hollywood actress. She was best known as the sardonic but likable English teacher in the radio and television series "Our Miss Brooks," which ran from 1948 until 1957. The series earned her an Emmy award as best actress for 1953.         The tall and languid Miss Brooks, noted for her exquisite comic timing and a knack for making the most of a throwaway line, received featured billing in more than 100 movies, including "Stage Door," "The Marx Brothers at the Circus," "No, No, Nanette," "Bedtime Story," "Cover Girl," "Anatomy of a Murder" and "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs." In 1945 she received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her performance in "Mildred Pierce."         The actress, whose original name was Eunice Quedens, was born in Mill Valley, Calif., near San Francisco. She was reared by her divorced mother and an aunt. Both encouraged her to act in school plays. At 16, she said, "I was dumped by my mother and aunt at the Henry Duffy office in San Francisco and told to get a job acting, which I did."         She joined the Duffy stock company, which performed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and she later switched to the Bandbox Repertory Theater, which toured the "citrus circuit" in Southern California.         Miss Arden was a seasoned 21-year-old actress when she got a job in "Low and Behold," a forerunner of the "New Faces" revues produced by Leonard Sillman. The producer Lee Shubert saw a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse and offered Miss Arden a part as a showgirl in the 1934 "Ziegfeld Follies" on Broadway. And he told her to shed her real name.         Eunice Quedens did so by studying the labels of cosmetic jars on her dressing table and, she said, "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden."         Eve Arden won her first theatrical accolade in 1935 when she was featured with Jimmy Savo in "Parade."The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: "Count on the credit side Eve Arden's lorgnette humor which turns a song entitled 'Send for the Militia' into highly amusing satire." That and other reviews helped to win Miss Arden a featured role in the 1936 "Ziegfeld Follies." As Fannie Brice's understudy, she starred in several performances. Success, With the Help of a Cat         Miss Arden made her film debut in a 1937 grade-B melodrama called "Oh, Doctor," in which she disastrously played a gun moll. But her big break came that same year when the director Gregory La Cava cast her in what was to have been a small role in "Stage Door," starring Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers.         The actress built up her supposedly minor role with the aid of a slothful cat named Henry, which hung around the set. Having noticed that the sluggish Henry hardly ever moved, Miss Arden called Mr. La Cava's attention to the fact that the cat liked to sleep draped over her shoulders. The director was amused, and he included many shots of Miss Arden wearing the live cat as a fur piece. She was long remembered as the "girl with the cat."         In three years Miss Arden appeared in more than 20 films, becoming typecast in roles characterized by brittle, caustic humor. Trying to get away from that stereotype, she returned to Broadway and won praise for her featured roles in the Kern-Hammerstein musical "Very Warm for May" in 1939, the revue "Two for the Show" in 1940 and Cole Porter's "Let's Face It" in 1941, in which she appeared with Danny Kaye.         Miss Arden nearly stole the 1944 war movie "The Doughgirls" from three stars by enlivening her role as a tough-talking Russian guerrilla, punctuating her flines in ractured English lines with funny and risque gestures with her sniper's rifle.         Other featured roles followed, most of them putting Miss Arden back in what she considered the rut of the coldly tart-tongued and vitriolic cynic. It mattered not, she said, that audiences always responded to her with laughter; she did not like seeing herself in those roles, which were carried over into radio shows in which she starred with Jack Haley and Jack Carson.         "I just don't like that dame," she said in 1952. "She is hard-boiled, unsentimental and not me."         With "Our Miss Brooks," Miss Arden was able to alter her image, keeping the snappy, sardonic lines but giving the schoolteacher character a warmly affectionate and self-deprecating side.         That television series went off the air in 1957, and Miss Arden appeared in only an occasional film until 1967, when she began a two-season run co- starring with the comedienne Kaye Ballard in the NBC television show "The Mothers-in-Law." She also appeared as a school principal in the films "Grease" in 1978 and "Grease II" in 1982, and in "Under the Rainbow" in 1981.         Miss Arden's second husband, Brooks West, an actor, died in 1984.         Survivors include two daughters, Liza and Constance, and two sons, Douglas and Duncan.         Correction:  November 17, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress Eve Arden misstated the date of her film debut. It was in 1929, when she appeared under her original name, Eunice Quedens, in "The Song of Love"; it was not in 1937.       
         Lisa Kirk, a cabaret performer who won Broadway acclaim in the late 1940's singing "The Gentleman Is a Dope" in the musical "Allegro" and "Always True to You (In My Fashion)" in "Kiss Me, Kate," died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 62 years old and had homes in New York City and Malibu, Calif.         Miss Kirk died of lung cancer, said her husband, the lyricist and producer Robert Wells. He said she had known of her illness for only two weeks, after seeing doctors because of a slight cough and mild fatigue. "She had never been ill in her life," he said. "She didn't drink, and she didn't smoke. It's unbelievable."         In the late 1960's, Miss Kirk was injured in an autombile accident that threatened to end her career. But she started "training like a fighter," she recalled later. When she appeared in 1972 at the St. Regis Sheraton Hotel in New York City, John S. Wilson of The New York Times wrote that "she is dancing and singing as though nothing had ever happened." Inspired by Cole Porter         Miss Kirk said at the time: "I kept thinking of Cole Porter, who had both legs crushed in a riding accident 10 years before he wrote 'Kiss Me, Kate.' It was seeing his determination to get better that made me work so hard."         When Miss Kirk performed at Rainbow and Stars last year, Mr. Wilson praised her "warm, easy projection" and said, "Her long career has given her polish, presence and a solid foundation of songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter and Jerry Herman with which she is associated."         Brought up in Roscoe, Pa., Miss Kirk studied at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. She appeared in New York nightclubs and on Broadway in "Good Night Ladies." But it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Allegro" that brought her fame in 1947. Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" the following year cemented her reputation.         Brooks Atkinson of The Times wrote, "Having startled the town last season by singing 'The Gentleman Is a Dope' as though she meant it, Miss Kirk is captivating it this year as a fully accredited hoyden with a sense of humor."         "Given a sardonic song like 'Always True to You (In My Fashion),' " he wrote, "she can translate it into pert and gleaming buffoonery."         Miss Kirk told an interviewer in 1956 that she had not realized at first that she had comic gifts. "I had the vague idea of becoming a new Helen Morgan," she recalled. "With that in mind, I practiced a song before a mirror and framed it in what I considered appropriate gestures. When I did it for a director and some backers of a show, those men fell off their seats laughing. I could see that the laugh wasn't ridicule. They were amused."         In 1964 she returned to Broadway, stepping into Meredith Willson's musical "Here's Love." In 1974 she appeared in "Mack and Mabel," a Broadway show with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. She was in a 1984 revival of Noel Coward's "Design for Living" at the Circle in the Square theater and appeared in London last summer in Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant."         She is survived by her husband.         A funeral service is planned for Friday at 11:15 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Madison Avenue and 81st Street.       
         Carol Sobieski, a film and television writer who was widely praised for her sensitive characterizations in original or adapted works, died on Sunday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 51 years old.         She died of amyloidosis, a blood plasma disease, the Writers Guild of America said.         Mrs. Sobieski's film credits include the scripts for John Huston's 1982 version of the Broadway musical "Annie," "Casey's Shadow" (1978), "Sylvester" (1984) and "Winter People" (1988).         Three of her television scripts won awards from the Writers Guild of America: "The Neon Ceiling" (1971), about a woman and her daughter, who stop at a desert diner and meet its alcoholic manager; "Sunshine" (1973), about a dying young woman who leaves audio tapes for the 3-year-old daughter who might otherwise forget her, and a sequel, "Christmas Sunshine" (1977). Emmy Nominations and a Prize         "Plain Speaking," Mrs. Sobieski's 1976 adaptation of Merle Miller's book about Harry S. Truman, won Emmy nominations for best script and best program, and a best-actor award for Ed Flanders.         Carol O'Brien Sobieski was born in Chicago and grew up in Amarillo, Tex. She graduated with honors from Smith College and earned a master's degree from Trinity College in Dublin.         She moved to Los Angeles in 1964. Among the movies she wrote for television are "Amelia Earhart (1976)," "The Women's Room (1980)," "Where the Ladies Go (1980)" and "The Bourne Identity (1988)." In writing "Amelia Earhart" she drew on her own experiences as a licensed pilot, and in "Casey's Shadow" and "Sylvester" on her longtime involvement with horses as a trainer, rider and teacher.         Mrs. Sobieski is survived by her husband, James; two daughters, Emmy, of Seattle, and Mona, of Santa Monica; a son, Jamie, of Stockton, Calif., and a sister, Wendy Marsh of Amarillo.       
         Anya Seton, the author of several popular historical and biographical novels, two of which were made into successful films, died on Thursday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She had been ill for several years and died of heart failure, a daughter, Pamela Cottier Forcey, said.         Miss Seton developed a devoted following from the 1940's to the 1970's for her carefully researched and evocative works, two of which, "Dragonwyck" and "Foxfire," were made into successful films. She won critical praise for her attention to the language and life style of the periods she wrote about, but she was frequently faulted for reworking familiar ground.  A First Book at 37         The daughter of a celebrated English author, artist and naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, and an American writer of travel books, Grace Gallatin, Miss Seton did not produce her first successful book until she was 37 years old. She had married the first of her two husbands when she was 18 and raised three children before turning seriously to writing.         She began selling short stories to newspapers -- her first brought her a check for $5 -- and in the late 1930's became interested in the story of Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia, a celebrated beauty of her time who died mysteriously.         Miss Seton decided to apply a fictional treatment to the woman's life and the result was "My Theodosia," published in 1941 and well received by critics and the public.         "Dragonwyck," her second published novel, gained international recognition. A Gothic tale set along the Hudson River in the 1840's, it was serialized by the Ladies' Home Journal, selected by the Dollar Book Club, translated into nine languages and made into a film starring Vincent Price as a feudal overlord who tyrannizes his tenant farmers, kills his wife and takes up with a distant relative, played by Gene Tierney. Role for Vincent Price         The film, released in 1946, was adapted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was his first directorial effort; it established him as a major force in movies and set a villainous style for Mr. Price that he was to repeat many times.         That year Miss Seton followed with "The Turquoise," a novel of the American Southwest in the 1890's, inspired by visits to her father's ranch in New Mexico. Two years later came "The Hearth and the Eagle," set in Marblehead on the Massachusetts coast.         For each of her books, Miss Seton spent a good deal of time getting to know the locale about which she was writing.         "It is impossible for me to describe or 'feel' any place to which I have not been," she once said. "I am inspired by places." "Dragonwyck," "The Turquoise," "The Hearth and the Eagle" and "Foxfire," the latter set in an Arizona ghost town and made into a 1955 film starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, all resulted from visits to places which, Miss Seton said, "suddenly became meaningful." Dark Romances         But her favorite books were her biographical novels. Besides "My Theodosia" these included "Katherine" (1954), the story of the mistress of John of Gaunt; "The Winthrop Woman" (1958), about the niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, and "Devil Water" (1962), "Avalon" (1965) and "Green Darkness" (1973), all of which take place in England and tell of dark romances.         Miss Seton was born in Manhattan and raised in Cos Cob, Conn., where her family had an estate. She was christened Ann, but a family friend, a Sioux chief, gave her the Indian name Anutika, which her family adapted to Anya. She traveled extensively with her parents; by the time she was 13 she had crossed the Atlantic eight times. She had private tutors much of the time but graduated from the Spence School.         Miss Seton was twice married and divorced. Her son, Seton Cottier, died in 1979. She is survived by Mrs. Forcey, who lives in Manhattan, and another daughter, Clemency Chase Coggins of Auburndale, Mass.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Joanne Dempsey, a professor of English at the University of San Diego, died last Thursday at her home in the Mission Hills section of San Diego. She was 44 years old.         Dr. Dempsey died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She joined the university faculty in 1980, a year before she received a doctorate in English from Harvard University. Previously, she had taught English at Harvard, at Boston University and at Vassar College.         A native of Mineola, L.I., she was a graduate of Newton College of the Sacred Heart in Newton, Mass., where she won a two-year scholarship to Sophia University in Tokyo. She also studied at the British Museum and Warburg Institute in London and at the American Academy in Rome.         Dr. Dempsey is survived by her parents, William H. and Frances Dempsey of Mineola, and a brother, William J. Jr., of Westbury, L.I.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.         Miss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in "Bulldog Drummond" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in "Disraeli" (1929) and John Barrymore in "Moby Dick" (1930).         She portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in "Me and My Gal" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in "Little Women" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in "Private Worlds" (1935).         The leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made "Algiers," a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called "Trade Winds," and she began an entirely new career.         A Change of Personality         Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- "The House Across the Bay" and "The Man I Married" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in "Man Hunt" (1941), a mysterious model in "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in "Scarlet Street" (1946).         She also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's "Macomber Affair" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's "Woman on the Beach" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's "Reckless Moment" (1949).         Then, easily shifting images again, she was an elegant, witty and nurturing mother in two classic film comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli: "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951), co-starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.         Later in 1951, Miss Bennett was a principal in a major Hollywood scandal. Mr. Wanger shot and wounded her longtime agent, Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot, accusing him of being a home wrecker. Miss Bennett later attributed her husband's outburst to desperation over large financial losses.         To avoid further notoriety, Mr. Wanger pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served 100 days at a minimum-security prison farm. Mr. Lang soon recovered, but Miss Bennett's film career did not. Before the shooting, she had starred in more than 60 movies. After it, at the age of 41, she was offered only a handful of roles.         Bad Timing         In a 1981 interview, she contrasted the judgmental 1950's with the sensation-crazed 70's and 80's. "It would never happen that way today," she said, laughing. "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures."         The Wangers divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage.         As movie offers dwindled, Miss Bennett turned to the stage and made successful national tours in such plays as "Susan and God," "Bell, Book and Candle," "Once More With Feeling," "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Never Too Late."         She also lent her presence and prestige to television's top gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," which ran from 1966 to 1971 and attracted a major cult following. The series, which also dealt with a guilt-ridden vampire (Jonathan Frid), has been frequently rebroadcast.         Associates invariably applauded Miss Bennett for professionalism and dedication. In her 1970 autobiography, "The Bennett Playbill," written with Lois Kibbee, she said her experience with "Dark Shadows," in which she played the mistress of a haunted mansion, had given her new regard for daytime television performers.         Miss Bennett was celebrated for not taking herself too seriously. In 1986, she remarked, "I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much."         Theatrical Lineage         Joan Bennett was born on Feb. 27, 1910, in Palisades, N.J. Her parents were Richard Bennett, a flamboyant matinee idol, and Adrienne Morrison, an actress whose lineage went back five generations to strolling players in 18th-century England. The couple's elder daughters, Constance and Barbara, also became actresses.         Miss Bennett attended St. Margaret's, a boarding school in Waterbury, Conn., and L'Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France. At the age of 16, she married John Marion Fox, whom she later described as a playboy and drunkard. At 17, she had a daughter, Diana, and at 18, she divorced Mr. Fox.         That same year, her father got her the ingenue role in a Broadway melodrama, "Jarnegan," in which he starred as a lecherous, brawling movie director. She received good notices, and after a five-month run, he helped her get her first movie contract. She soon succeeded in "Bulldog Drummond" and over the next decade starred in 33 films. Her major early setback was a final-round loss of the role of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh.         About Hollywood in the 1930's, Miss Bennett recalled: "The industry held a combination of nuts, talents, charlatans and geniuses, all of whom were learning, bumbling and creating with fury and innocence. The colorful types had a passionate love for the business, not just for the money. Today, it seems to me, it's strictly a big business, based on dollars and cents."         Miss Bennett is survived by her fourth husband, David Wilde, a former critic and publisher whom she married in 1973; four daughters, Diana Anderson of Los Angeles and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y., from her second marriage to Gene Markey, a film writer-producer whom she married in 1932 and divorced in 1937, and Stephanie Guest and Shelley Wanger, both of Manhattan, from her marriage to Mr. Wanger, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Alice Marble, a Californian who grudgingly gave up baseball and grew into America's No. 1 female tennis player by winning the United States women's amateur singles title four times between 1936 and 1940, died yesterday at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. Miss Marble, a longtime resident of Palm Desert, Calif., was 77 years old.         Miss Marble, who suffered from pernicious anemia, according to her sister-in-law, Bernice Marble of San Francisco, was admitted to the hospital on Saturday and died at 1:35 A.M. yesterday. A hospital spokesman, Randy Bevilacqua, gave no cause of death.         To achieve her stature as the golden-haired queen of women's tennis, Miss Marble had to overcome obstacles. Born on Sept. 13, 1913, in the lumber town of Beckwith in the Sierra Nevadas, she left with her parents and three brothers at the age of 5 to grow up in San Francisco, a chubby girl athlete, adept at boxing, baseball and basketball. Turned to Tennis at 15         Her athletic skills were not turned to tennis until the age of 15. The former Little Queen of Swat learned the game quickly in Golden Gate Park. After winning many junior tournaments in California, her progress was slowed in 1933 by a case of sunstroke after she played 108 games of tennis in one day at East Hampton, L.I.         Then, in 1934, she suffered a complete collapse during a French-American series of matches at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris, which led to a diagnosis of pleurisy. She required a year of rest in a sanitarium, causing her to miss most of the 1934 and 1935 seasons.         When she applied to play in the national amateur championship at Forest Hills in 1936, the tournament committee refused to accept her entry, saying she was unfit to play and might permanently jeopardize her health. But after practicing a week, Miss Marble persuaded the committee to accept her entry and she went on to win her first national championship. Ranked No. 1 in 1936-1940         As the No. 1-ranked woman from 1936 to 1940, she dominated the game. She won the United States singles title again in 1938, 1939 and 1940 and the women's singles at Wimbledon in 1939.         With Sarah Palfrey Fabyan she won the United States women's doubles championships from 1937 through 1940 and the mixed-doubles title with Gene Mako in 1936, with Donald Budge in 1938, with Harry Hopman in 1939 and with Bobby Riggs in 1940. At Wimbledon, she also won the women's doubles in 1938 and 1939 with Mrs. Fabyan and the mixed doubles with Budge in 1937 and 1938 and with Riggs in 1939.         In 1939, she had won the singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles at both Forest Hills and Wimbledon and in 1940 she was undefeated. As a member of four winning Wightman Cup teams in matches against Britain during the 1930's she lost only one match in singles and one in doubles. Aided by a Coach         After her illness, Miss Marble was aided by the coaching of Eleanor Tennant, who made changes in her strokes. Miss Marble played an all-out athletic game complete with strong volleys and smashes. She was also adept at the twist serve and possessed a strong backhand. She was unusually quick on her feet and used her speed to good advantage while attacking the net.         Jack Kramer, a member of the Tennis Hall of Fame, said yesterday of Miss Marble: "She was the lady who most changed the style of play for women. She introduced the aggressive and athletic style that has led down to the female stars of today like Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf."         "Alice Marble was a picture of unrestrained athleticism," said Billie Jean King. "She is remembered as one of the greatest women to play the game because of her pioneering style in power tennis. I also admired her tremendously because she always helped others." Became a Pro After 1940         After her conquests of 1939 and 1940, Miss Marble renounced her amateur standing and turned professional. Since there were no professional tournaments for women, she played a series of exhibitions until the outbreak of World War II, when she enlisted in the Hale America movement to assist in improving the physical condition of women and youngsters.         She also played exhibition tennis matches to entertain servicemen and to promote the sales of war bonds. She was inducted into the Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., in 1964 with Donald Budge, her former mixed-doubles partner.         In 1946 she published a book "The Road to Wimbledon." She said she wrote it "because of so many requests from friends and fans who asked me to tell them the secret of success." Autobiography to Be Published         After the war, she continued to play exhibition matches and give tennis clinics in the United States and abroad. She also designed sportswear and traveled as a lecturer.         Her autobiogrpahy, "Courting Danger," written with Dale Leatherman, is scheduled for publication in June 1991, by St. Martin's Press.         In it, according to Miss Leatherman, Miss Marble writes of her marriage to Joe Crowley, an Army pilot who was shot down and killed over Germany during World War II. She also told of accepting an assignment as a spy for Army Intelligence in 1945 to gather information in Switzerland about German financial accounts. During the operation, she was shot in the back, but was rescued by her military intelligence contact and recovered. She was told not to mention the operation to anyone after the war.         Asked at a news conference in 1984 if she had any regrets about her tennis career, Miss Marble said, "I did not get to see myself on television and I did not get to play the tie breaker."       
         Anne Revere, an actress who won acclaim for her screen portrayals of wise, protective motherly characters until her career was cut short by the 1950's Communist blacklist, died yesterday at her home in Locust Valley, L.I. She was 87 years old.         She died of pneumonia, Dr. Howard B. Gotlieb, the director of collections and curator of her archives at Boston University, said.         The stately, spirited character actress won a 1945 Academy Award as the mother of Elizabeth Taylor in "National Velvet." Miss Revere was also nominated for supporting Oscars for playing the mothers of Jennifer Jones in "The Song of Bernadette" (1943) and of Gregory Peck in "Gentleman's Agreement" (1947).         Miss Revere was also the understanding mother of John Garfield in "Body and Soul" (1947) and of Montgomery Clift in "A Place in the Sun" (1951). Her salt-of-the-earth motif was her straight hair carefully combed into a practical bun.         From 1934 to 1951, she was much in demand, appearing in nearly three dozen films, including "The Howards of Virginia," "Old Acquaintance," "The Keys of the Kingdom," "Fallen Angel," "Dragonwyck" and "Forever Amber." But then she was blacklisted by the industry and barred from films for 20 years for refusing to testify about Communist links before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         The actress voluntarily resigned from the board of the Screen Actors Guild in 1951 because she believed her silence on Capitol Hill had barred her from making further films.  Back to the Stage         "Nobody went to jail because they were Communists," she said in an interview in 1975. "They went to jail for contempt. But the awful thing about the whole bloody era was that whether you answered or didn't, cooperated or not, you were dead in the business."         Miss Revere left Hollywood to seek roles on the stage, where she had trained, and starred in regional theaters and stock and occasionally on Broadway. She won a 1960 Tony Award for portraying a rigid spinster opposite Maureen Stapleton and Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's drama "Toys in the Attic."         Anne Revere was born in Manhattan on June 25, 1903. Her father, Clinton, was a stockbroker, and she grew up on the Upper West Side and in Westfield, N.J. She earned a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley College in 1926 and studied at the American Laboratory School in New York City with Maria Ouspenskaya and Richard Boleslavsky.         Miss Revere honed her craft in stock and regional theaters. Her first Broadway triumph was in Lillian Hellman's first play, the 1934 drama "The Children's Hour," as one of two ill-fated teachers at a girls' school falsely accused of lesbianism. The long-running play led to other leading stage roles and her Hollywood contract.         Samuel Rosen, a stage director who was Miss Revere's husband of 49 years, died in 1984. She is survived by a sister, Winn Revere Smith, of Cross River, L.I.       
         Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald and a leading proponent of women's advancement to the top levels of management in American journalism, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami. She was 60 years old.         The Herald said Ms. Chusmir suffered a brain aneurysm on Friday night, aboutan hour after returning to her home in Miami Beach after the paper's evening news conference at her office.         We have lost a great friend and a great editor," said The Herald's publisher, David Lawrence. "What a zest she had for good newspapers; what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right and fair for everyone."         In Ms. Chusmir's three-year tenure as executive editor, The Herald won two Pulitzer Prizes. And in November 1988, less than a year after she was appointed to the paper's top news post, The Herald introduced an enlarged and revamped Spanish-language newspaper, with a separate staff, called El Nuevo Herald. A month ago she was named Editor of the Year by the National Press Foundation, which cited her for "transforming The Herald to serve the unique multicultural population of greater Miami."         When Ms. Chusmir was named The Herald's executive editor in December 1987, about 85 percent of the newsroom executives in the country were men, according to a survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Of the society's 1,000 members -- the top editors of the nation's dailies -- about 80 were women. Opposed Special Position         The dearth of women in high positions was the subject of a seminar at the society's convention in 1988. And when an editor suggested that it was desirable for newspapers to create a "woman's seat" among their top editors, Ms. Chusmir denounced the idea. "The seat becomes devalued," she said, "and the function becomes devalued."         Ms. Chusmir was a feminist who understood the potency of understatement. She recently told a group of Hispanic women: "Pick your battles. It's not good to be fighting over each little thing and male chauvinistic action. Instead, fight for the important things: equal pay and equal respect. Fight smart."         At the same time, she was fond of telling female executives not to forsake their ability to nurture. "I always remind myself that I can't hug a newspaper," she said.         Janet Zoll was born in Boston and earned a journalism degree from Boston University in 1949. A week after graduation she married the editor of her college newspaper, Leonard Chusmir, and soon became a mother and homemaker.         It was not until after moving to Miami Beach with her two school-age children in 1963 that Ms. Chusmir took a job at the Miami Beach Daily Sun, which no longer operates, writing articles at a flat rate of $2.50 each. She was soon given a full-time position. Five Years in Colorado         In 1968, The Herald hired her as a general assignment reporter, and, soon afterward, she was writing a column and receiving awards for her feature writing. In the early 1970's, Ms. Chusmir was named editor of The Herald section News For and About Women, which in her tenure was renamed Living Today. By 1977, she had been promoted to assistant managing editor for features.         Then, in 1982, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, the Herald's corporate parent, appointed her president and publisher of The Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., making her the first female chief executive of one of the organization's newspapers. Five years later, she returned to The Herald as executive editor.         Last year, in an occasional column she wrote, "View From the Newsroom," Ms. Chusmir offered readers a personal glance at herself. She said her favorite avocations were "baking, reading, swimming, dieting." Her favorite place was "my balcony at sunset." And of journalism, she said, "It's a sacred trust."         Besides her husband, Ms. Chusmir is survived by a son, Steven, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro of Daytona Beach, and a grandson.
