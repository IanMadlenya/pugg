        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations. Actress, Trend-Setter and Author         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips.         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after the end of her career, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned a million dollars a year from films and she was also an author, writing ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' In another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' she dealt with an elaborate miniature doll house she built in the mid-1920's that cost $470,000 and was designed in the form of a castle, complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio. The doll house later was sent around the country for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Michigan on Aug. 19, 1902. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse. 'A New Type Was Born'         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper.         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         In 1937 she married Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, her third husband, and ended her film career. She had previously been married to a film producer, John McCormick, and a New York broker, Albert F. Scott. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children, whom she came to consider her own. He died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daugher, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman, several grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

        Grace Bechtold, a vice president and executive editor of Bantam Books, died of cancer Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Grace Bechtold, a vice president and executive editor of Bantam Books, died of cancer Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Bechtold was an editor at Bantam for almost 40 years. In his book ''Two-Bit Culture: The Paperbacking of America,'' Kenneth C. Davis described her as ''the doyenne of women paperback editors.'' Not only was she a woman in a field long dominated by males, she was also one of the first mass market editors to perceive the broader potential of religious and inspirational books, acquiring for Bantam the paperback rights to books by Hal Lindsey, Og Mandino and a number of others.         She also bought the reprint rights to ''Life After Death'' by Dr. Raymond A. Moody Jr., a book of case studies of near-death experiences that has sold more than a million copies in paperback. The First of the Instants         In addition to acquiring romance and other category books, Miss Bechtold also acquired books ranging from works by Carson McCullers to ''Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution.'' She edited ''The Report of the Warren Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy,'' published in September 1964, the first of many Bantam ''instant'' paperback books.         ''Grace's editorial vision was matched by a tireless devotion to nurturing young editorial talent,'' said Alberto Vitale, the president of the Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group. ''Many who benefited from her tutelage as her assistants or associates have blossomed into highly regarded editors and executives.''         Born in Belleville, Ill., Miss Bechtold worked in advertising in Chicago before relocating to New York in the mid-1940's. For a time she was an editor with the Doubleday book clubs, before joining Bantam just four years after its founding. There are no survivors.  Funeral services are to be held today at 4 P.M. at the First Presbyterian Church, on Fifth Avenue at 12th Street.

She was 78 years old.         Ms. Wood was national executive director of the Girl Scouts from 1961 to 1972, when she retired. During her tenure as its leader, the organization had four million members.         Ms. Wood held various jobs with the American National Red Cross during World War II and until 1953, and in 1947 she was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Truman for her services.         Ms. Wood was born in Mankato, Minn., and earned a bachelor's degree from Macalester College in St. Paul and a master's from Teachers College of Columbia University.         Surviving are four brothers: Dr. Earl Wood of Rochester, Minn.; Dr. Harland Wood of Cleveland; Dr. Chester Wood of Orlando, Fla., and Delbert Wood of South St. Paul, Minn.       
        Ella Raines, an actress who starred in film dramas, comedies and westerns during the 1940's, died of throat cancer May 30 in Los Angeles. She was 67 years old.         Ella Raines, an actress who starred in film dramas, comedies and westerns during the 1940's, died of throat cancer May 30 in Los Angeles. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Raines's film career took off in 1943. That year she starred opposite Randolph Scott in the wartime thriller ''Corvette K-255'' and became the only actress under contract to a new $1 million production company founded by Howard Hawks and Charles Boyer. Her best-known starring role was in the suspense film ''Phantom Lady'' in 1944. More often she appeared opposite some of the leading actors of the day, including John Wayne in ''Tall in the Saddle'' (1944), Charles Laughton in ''Suspect'' (1945) and William Powell in the Charles MacArthur-George S. Kaufman satire ''The Senator Was Indiscreet'' (1947). Worked With Preston Sturges         She also worked with the director Preston Sturges in ''Hail the Conquering Hero'' (1944). She starred in a television show, ''Janet Dean, R.N.'' in 1953-54. More recently, she appeared in an episode of television's ''Matt Houston,'' although she had largely been in retirement.         A two-year marriage to her high-school sweetheart, Kenneth Trout, a lieutenant in the Army Air Force, ended in divorce in 1945. In 1947 she married an Air Force major, Robin Olds. A hero in World War II and Vietnam, he later became a brigadier general and commander of the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs. They had two daughters.         After her marriage, Ms. Raines appeared in films less frequently. In 1967, when her husband was serving in Vietnam, she characterized herself in a newspaper article as ''an Army wife'' and paid tribute to ''service wives . . . for maintaining a home that is as normal as possible for the children while keeping their worries to themselves.''         She and her husband were divorced in 1975. She is survived by her daughters, Christina Newman and Susan Olds, and a granddaughter.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Marisa Bellisario, president of Italy's Italtel telecommunications company and former head of Olivetti Corporation of America, died of cancer today at her home in Turin. She was in her early 50's.         Marisa Bellisario, president of Italy's Italtel telecommunications company and former head of Olivetti Corporation of America, died of cancer today at her home in Turin. She was in her early 50's.         Miss Bellisario was appointed managing director and chief executive officer of the state-owned Italtel group in 1981. Italtel, formally Italtel Societa Italiana Telecomunicazione, is the 34th largest company in Italy, according to reports, and one of several telecommunications operations in that nation.         When she took over, losses were more than $215 million a year. She cut the losses in half in 1982 and then returned it to profitability, where it has remained under her direction.         She wrote her own life story in the book ''Woman and Top Manager,'' frequently worked 12-hour days, but refused to work weekends in order to spend the time with her husband, Lionello Cantoni, a mathematics professor.         ''Maybe I can show young girls that you can make it and still be a normal woman, with normal attitudes toward your family or husband,'' she said.         Before joining Italtel, Miss Bellisario was president and chief executive of Olivetti of America. She joined the company in 1972 and became director of corporate planning and then director of the Distributed Data Processing group.         She became the head of product and operations planning at General Electric Information Systems Italia in 1965 and kept that post when the electronics division was acquired by Honeywell Information Systems Italia in 1969.         Miss Bellisario, an economics graduate of Turin University, began her business career in Olivetti's computer division in 1960.       
        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         As Lois W., she was revered as ''the first lady of Al-Anon,'' and as a living reminder of the beginnings five decades ago of the Alcoholics Anonymous self-help movement.         Al-Anon members help one another and themselves to deal with personal problems by speaking about them -''sharing their experience, strength and hope,'' as they like to say - at group meetings. They also help each other on a one-to-one basis, and they read the movement's many inspirational pamphlets and books. Thousands of Groups Formed         An executive on the staff of the Al-Anon Family Group headquarters in Manhattan, where Mrs. Wilson's death was announced yesterday, said 30,000 groups - including several thousand Alateen groups for the teen-age children of alcoholics - are in operation.         The executive, who in accordance with Al-Anon policy declined to give her name, said more than 20,000 of the groups were in the United States and Canada, with groups in about 100 other nations. She estimated worldwide membership of Al-Anon at about 500,000.         In the 1930's, Mrs. Wilson - a spirited, small woman with lively brown eyes - stuck by her alcoholic husband, William G. Wilson, who had become a self-described ''hanger-on in Wall Street.'' She hoped he would manage to stop drinking for good.         Mr. Wilson did, and in 1935 he became a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of its groups flourished in the Wilsons' home, then an apartment at 182 Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Since those early days, Alcoholics Anonymous has grown to an international membership of more than 1.5 million. Known within that organization as Bill W., Mr. Wilson died in 1971. A Time of Discontent         After Alcoholics Anonymous was founded, Mrs. Wilson became discontented. ''It seemed I saw nothing of the man I had tried to help,'' she later recalled.         ''He was always with his A.A. cronies'' who helped him to resist alcohol, she said, adding that ''I guess I was jealous and resentful that these strangers had done for him what I could not do.''         A turning point for her came one day when, as she said, ''I threw my shoe at him as hard as I could.''         ''I was so ashamed of myself,'' she said, ''that I went out and walked around the block several times. I soon had to admit that I needed some therapy myself.''         Mrs. Wilson, who was not an alcoholic, began applying to herself the same self-help principles that her husband and his Alcoholics Anonymous friends were using.         ''I shared my experience with other relatives of alcoholics, and we began to hold informal meetings,'' she said. ''We did not discuss our alcoholic relatives, but tried to straighten out our own lives. This attitude became basic to Al-Anon.'' Two Separate Organizations         Though Al-Anon is in many ways patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous, the two organizations are organizationally separate. Both groups are self-supporting; they do not accept funds from nonmembers. Members of both groups are supposed to maintain anonymity in the news media - which is why Mrs. Wilson and her husband were widely known only by their first names.         Mrs. Wilson was said never to have voiced blanket condemnation of the drinking of alcoholic beverages, affirming that she opposed ''only the disease of alcoholism and the damage it does to a family.''         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a physician. She graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, worked in a Y.W.C.A. and taught school in Short Hills, N.J., before her marriage to Mr. Wilson in 1918. After her marriage she worked for a time as an occupational therapist, wrote magazine articles and worked as a Macy's sales clerk.         After Mrs. Wilson and other alcoholics' relatives began their meetings, similar self-help discussion groups for members of alcoholics' families were founded elsewhere in the United States during the 1940's. In 1951, Mrs. Wilson, along with a friend and Westchester County neighbor, Anne B., set up a central information center for these groups. The center was initially in her Westchester home. First Alateen Group         Not long afterward, the center moved into offices in Manhattan, and the movement took the name Al-Anon Family Groups. In 1957, the first Alateen self-help group was set up, in California, for young people with alcoholism in their families.         Mrs. Wilson remained active and prominent in Al-Anon into the 1980's, traveling on its behalf and appearing at and addressing Al-Anon gatherings. At the first international convention of Al-Anon, in 1985 in Montreal, an audience of 45,000 -members of Alcoholics Anonymous as well as Al-Anon - gave her a standing ovation.         Mrs. Wilson wrote an autobiography, ''Lois Remembers,'' first published in 1979.         There are no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements have not yet been set.       
        Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         Christina Onassis, the head of a family business empire and stepdaughter of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, died of a heart attack while visiting friends in Argentina yesterday, according to local news reports from Buenos Aires. She was 37 years old.         The reports said Ms. Onassis had been staying with childhood friends at an exclusive country club outside the Argentine capital. Her father, Aristotle Onassis, laid the foundation of his self-made fortune in shipping, real estate and high finance in Argentina and was a dual citizen of that country and Greece.         Mr. Onassis died in 1975 in France and his daughter and only surviving child was left in charge of the Onassis Group, with assets then variously estimated at $500 million to $1 billion, most of it in shipping. Forbes magazine, citing a worldwide slump in that industry, reported in 1987 that the figure probably had shrunk to $250 million or less.         Mr. Onassis' two major shipping companies were Springfield Shipping of New York City and Olympic Maritime of Monte Carlo.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Onassis gave up her American citizenship. She learned about business and finance in the New York offices of her father, beginning as a 20-year-old secretary. After his death, she gradually strengthened her hold over the Onassis Group, although some questions remained in the late 1970's as to just how much control she exerted and how much she left to day-to-day managers.         One of the world's richest women, Miss Onassis was no stranger to personal misfortune. There was the death of her only brother, Alexander, in a private-plane crash in 1973. She herself went through four much-publicized marriages and divorces. Churchill and Callas         The social life on ''Ari'' Onassis' 325-foot yacht, named Christina, was legendary and included the likes of Winston Churchill and the soprano Maria Callas. In fact, Mr. Onassis was romantically linked with Miss Callas when his own marriage to the former Athina (Tina) Livanos, another shipping heiress, broke up in 1959.         Tina Onassis eventually was remarried to her former husband's arch rival, Stavros Niarchos. And Ari Onassis, in 1968, married Mrs. Kennedy, the widow of President John F. Kennedy, whom he first met in 1963.         Christina Onassis defied her father in 1971 by marrying Joseph Bolker, a millionaire home builder and real-estate man, A divorced father of four, he was 27 years her senior and the union broke up within months, apparently at the insistence of her father.         Her next marriage, strongly promoted by her father, took place shortly after his death. Her second husband was Alexander Andreadis, a Greek shipping and banking heir. It, too, lasted only 14 months.         Miss Onassis' third marriage, in Moscow in 1978 to Sergei Kauzov, a Soviet shipping agent, again made front-page headlines, as did her flight to Greece a few days later and their separation in 1979. Marries Frenchman         She married a French businessman, Thierry Roussel, in 1984 and had a daughter with him, Athina, the following January. They filed for divorce eight months later.         Ms. Onassis was said to have never felt close to her stepmother. Friends in Athens said Mr. Onassis was thinking of divorcing the former Mrs. Kennedy at the time of his death and had intended to limit a divorce settlement to $3 million rather than the $250,000 a year provided in his will.         The reports of a forthcoming divorce were denied by Christina, who in 1977 was said to have made a much more generous multi-million settlement in return for which Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dropped all further claims against the estate.       
        Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Miss Parish's best-known character is Amelia Bedelia, a literal-minded maid who cuts a mistake-prone swath through 11 books (which are illustrated by various artists). When told to help the children plant bulbs, she buys light bulbs. When told to weed the garden, she plants row upon row of big weeds. When her employers, Mr. and Mr. Rogers, ask her to stuff stockings for the neighbors' children, she wonders why they want stockings full of turkey stuffing, but she dutifully obeys. When she is asked to make a spongecake, she snips a sponge into small pieces and drops it into a cake. A Birthday Celebration         Amelia Bedelia has many redeeming qualities, of course, not the least of which is her naivete, and she is loved by her fictional employers. She is also loved by real schoolchildren, many of whom joined in a celebration this year of Amelia Bedelia's 25th birthday, sponsored jointly by Greenwillow Books, Harper & Row and Avon Books, her principal publishers.         Paulette C. Kaufmann, director of children's book marketing at William Morrow & Company, the publisher of Greenwillow, said that hundreds of bookstores and libraries were given mailboxes in which children were invited to submit birthday wishes. ''Since August,'' she said, ''the contents of those mailboxes have been arriving daily - thousands of letters and drawings from children who have read and loved books about Amelia Bedelia.'' From Teacher to Writer         Miss Parish was born in Manning, and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English. She taught school in Oklahoma, Kentucky and, for more than 15 years, at the Dalton School in Manhattan. It was while teaching third grade at the Dalton School that she published her first book, in 1961. Her first Amelia Bedelia book was published two years later.         Her other books include ''The Cats' Burglar,'' ''Dinosaur Time,'' ''The Ghosts of Cougar Island,'' ''Good Hunting Little Indian,'' ''Hermit Dan'' and ''Let's Be Early Settlers With Daniel Boone.''         Miss Parish had a lifelong interest in teaching children to read and study, and she was proud that her books were often used in schools. She returned to Manning in 1972, continuing to write and to speak to library associations and children's education groups.         She is survived by her brother, Stanley, of Manning. A funeral service is to be held today at 2 P.M. at the Presbyterian Church in Manning.       
        Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Mrs. Gottlieb was the founder and president of the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, set up in 1976 according to provisions in her husband's will to assist older artists in need. The foundation, with assets of some $6 million derived from the sale of Mr. Gottlieb's works, gives 10 grants a year and maintains an emergency assistance program. The foundation will continue, its director, Sanford Hirsch, said.         Mrs. Gottlieb was born in Danbury, Conn., on April 15, 1907. She came to New York in 1924, studied art at Pratt Institute and became a painter, working in the garment industry to support herself. In 1932 she married Mr. Gottlieb, and began teaching tailoring skills at the Cental Needle Trades High School - now Fashion Industries High School. She supported her husband financially, eventually giving up her own painting to work as his studio assistant. She retired in 1960. Mr. Gottlieb died in 1974.         Mrs. Gottlieb is survived by two sisters, Frances Dick and Gladys Sikora, both of New York City, and six nieces and nephews.         A funeral service will be held today at 10:30 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed her social schedule.         Her husband, Morris Cafritz, a millionare Washington real estate developer and businessman, died in 1964. After his death, she became president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6 million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community service, health and education.         The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from below, to Supreme Court justices. President Harry Truman, however, favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Perle Mesta.         Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in the 1920's. In June 1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ''trip back into Washington social history.''         In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in furs and jewelry.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.
