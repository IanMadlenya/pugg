         Louise Roberts, who directed the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan, died on Jan. 17 at Bellevue Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         In her nearly three decades of presenting dance, Ms. Roberts helped shape the careers of many fledgling avant-garde and black choreographers who later became major modern dance artists, among them Kei Takei, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and Bill T. Jones. A small, rotund woman with an earthy sense of humor, Ms. Roberts also served as a patient yet eminently practical ''great mother figure,'' as Alvin Ailey put it, to several generations of modern dancers.         A central tenet of her career as a dance producer was that no one should be excluded from dance because of imperfect bodies or the color of their skin. She also believed that dance ought to be available to everyone, whether through the low-cost classes at Clark Center or affordable concerts. She wanted, she said in a 1986 interview, to ''offer people the opportunity to take chances.''         Born in Boston, Ms. Roberts attended Hunter College in Manhattan, graduating in 1931 with a degree in political science. It was during her college years that Ms. Roberts began to study dance seriously, performing  with Blanche Evan. When her husband, Paul Ziporkis, died in 1953, Ms. Roberts was left with a daughter to bring up alone. She worked as a magazine caption writer, an administrator at the Downtown Community School and as the director of the June Taylor School before moving on to Clark Center in 1970.         A friendship with Donald McKayle, a young choreographer, led to her first experience producing dance when Mr. McKayle asked her for help in putting on a concert at the 92d Street Y. Ms. Roberts continued to present dance regularly at Clark Center, where Alvin Ailey had started his company in the 1960's. The center is also where Wendy Wasserstein had the first staged reading of one of her plays.         From 1975 to 1978, Ms. Roberts produced a summer dance festival in the mall at the City College Graduate Center on West 42d Street. Her dreams of moving Clark Center from small, dingy studios on Eighth Avenue to a new theater and studio complex on the West 42d Street Theater Row in the mid-80's were dashed after the city reneged on promised support. Ms. Roberts rebounded with an ambitious eight-week series at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row in 1986, the year she resigned from Clark Center. ''We're going to be dancing on 42d Street,'' she told a reporter. ''I may cry a lot, but that's what we're going to do.'' The Clark Center closed in 1988.         Ms. Roberts was a Capezio Award honoree in 1991 and won a Bessie Award in 1986.         She is survived by a daughter, Karen deFrancis of Brooklyn, and a stepsister, Grace Herman of Manhattan.       
         Edith Thacher Hurd, whose books on subjects from the earth to whales to firemen reached several generations of readers learning their way around the printed page, died on Saturday in Walnut Creek, Calif. She was 86.         Mrs. Hurd wrote some 75 books for elementary-school children covering the range of juvenile curiosity. Much of her work grew from a creative symbiosis with her husband, Clement Hurd, the artist and illustrator.         In the early 1930's, the couple were just out of college, she from Radcliffe, he from Yale and art school in Paris. They met in New York City while continuing their education at Bank Street College, and married in 1939.         She wrote and he drew the pictures for almost 50 books until their last collaboration on ''The Earth is Not Flat'' (1986). It was meant as a companion to a book Mr. Hurd had illustrated decades earlier, Gertrude Stein's ''The Earth Is Round,'' published in 1938. Clement Hurd died in 1988 at the age of 80.         Mrs. Hurd was born in Kansas City, Mo. At Bank Street College she also met Margaret Wise Brown, with whom she wrote several children's books under the joint pseudonym of Juniper Sage.         These included ''The Man in the Manhole and the Fix-It Men'' (1946), ''Five Little Firemen'' (1948), ''Two Little Miners'' (1949) and ''The Little Fat Policeman'' (1950). Clement Hurd also did illustrations for Mrs. Brown, who had persuaded him to enroll at Bank Street to try picture-book illustrations.         Mrs. Hurd's first solo writing effort, ''Hurry Hurry,'' was published in 1938 by W.R. Scott, a pioneer modern children's book publisher. A follow-up, ''Hurry Hurry: A Story of What Happened to a Hurrier,'' appeared in 1947.         The Hurds became regular contributors to the Harper ''I Can Read'' series. The titles there included ''Johnny Lion's Book,'' ''Come and Have Fun,'' ''Stop Stop'' and ''No Funny Business.''         Other titles included ''Christmas Eve,'' ''The Day the Sun Danced'' and ''Wilson's World,'' a cautionary environmental tale about a boy who paints a world but must draw it over again to make it better.         Mrs. Hurd also wrote science books for young readers, some of which were also illustrated by her husband. They included ''The Blue Heron Tree,'' ''Rain and the Valley,'' ''The Mother Whale'' and ''The Mother Deer.''         She is survived by a son, John Thacher Hurd of Berkeley, Calif., himself a writer and illustrator of children's books; and a brother, Nicholas Thacher, of San Francisco.       
         Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu, a physicist who performed a historic experiment overturning what had been considered a fundamental law of nature, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Dr. Luke C. L. Yuan, a retired experimental physicist.         Dr. Wu, the Michael I. Pupin Professor Emeritus of Physics at Columbia University, where she carried out research and taught for 37 years, was known throughout her career as a meticulously accurate experimental physicist who was in demand to put new theories to the test.         In her most famous experiment, announced in 1957, she and her colleagues overthrew a law of symmetry in physics called the principle of conservation of parity that had been considered incontrovertible for 30 years. It held that in nuclear reactions, nature in effect does not differentiate between left and right. At one time, physicists were so certain of the validity of the law that they tried to make all of their observations fit it.         But Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, also of Columbia, and Dr. Chen Ning Yang of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., suggested that conservation of parity did not hold for interactions between subatomic particles involving the so-called weak force. (One of the four basic forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force plays a role in radioactive decay.)         Dr. Lee consulted with Dr. Wu, an expert in radioactive beta decay, in which an atom emits electrons. Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang suggested an experiment, but Dr. Wu had to find a way to carry it out, an extremely difficult challenge with the technology available at the time.         The experiment used cobalt 60 cooled to 0.01 degree above absolute zero (or minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). Dr. Wu joined forces with a research team at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, which had one of the few laboratories in the country that could chill materials to extremely low temperatures.         The cobalt 60, a radioactive isotope, was placed in a strong electromagnetic field, which made all the cobalt nuclei line up so they spun along the same axis.         Dr. Wu measured what happened when the cobalt nuclei broke down, giving off electrons. She used a device that counted the number of particles that shot out in the direction of the spin and those that did not.         If the law of conservation of parity was correct, the nuclei would give off equal numbers of particles in each direction. But Dr. Wu found that far more particles flew off in the direction opposite the spin of the nuclei, proving that nature differentiates between left and right.         The results were confirmed by other experiments.         Dr. Isador I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate in physics at Columbia, said at the time, ''In a certain sense, a rather complete theoretical structure has been shattered at the base, and we are not sure how the pieces will be put together.''         Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their theoretical work in this area. Dr. Wu did not share the prize, but the playwright Clare Boothe Luce said at the time, ''When Dr. Wu knocked out that principle of parity, she established the principle of parity between men and women.''         Dr. Lee said yesterday, ''C. S. Wu was one of the giants of physics.''         Dr. Wu was born on May 29, 1912, near Shanghai. She received a bachelor's degree from National Central University in Nanjing in 1936 and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1940.         She taught at Smith College and Princeton University before being asked to join the Manhattan Project, the Army's secret project to develop the atomic bomb in World War II. She helped develop a process to enrich uranium ore that produced large quantities of uranium 235, a fuel for the bomb.         As part of the project, an atomic pile was built at Hanford, Wash., in 1942, but its chain reaction stopped a few hours after it was started. The physicist Enrico Fermi suspected that a substance produced by nuclear fission was halting the reaction by capturing most of the neutrons.         He was reportedly told, ''Ask Miss Wu.'' It turned out that a rare gas that she had studied in graduate school was responsible, and the problem was cleared up.         After the war Dr. Wu joined Columbia as a research associate. She was named a full professor in 1958 and was appointed the first Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973.         In her research, she obtained the first successful measurements of low-energy electrons emitted by beta decay, providing experimental evidence for Fermi's theory of weak interactions in the nucleus. She was an author of ''Beta Decay,'' published in 1965, a standard reference for nuclear physicists.         In 1975 Dr. Wu became the first woman to be elected president of the American Physical Society, the chief organization of physicists in the United States. She was also the first woman to receive the Cyrus B. Comstock Award of the National Academy of Sciences and the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate in science from Princeton. The university's president, Robert F. Goheen, said in presenting it in 1958 that Dr. Wu had ''richly earned the right to be called the world's foremost female experimental physicist.''         She also received the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for achievement in science, and the Wolf Prize in physics. Dr. Wu was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh as an honorary fellow.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Vincent Yuan, of Albuquerque, N.M., who is a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Hedwig G. Sulzle, who with her husband started a workshop atop a garage in central New York State in 1945 and built it into the world's largest independent manufacturer of surgical needles, died on Monday at her home in Syracuse. She was 97.         She was the co-founder and for many years the principal manager of the B. G. Sulzle Company, a family enterprise with headquarters at 1 Needle Lane in North Syracuse. She curtailed her role in recent years, particularly after a shoulder injury in 1991.         Mrs. Sulzle emigrated from Aachen, Germany, to the United States in 1928. She and her husband, Benjamin, began to produce their needles in a spare bedroom before moving the operation into the garage below. Their product derived from an innovative design and manufacturing process that Mr. Sulzle developed.         It resulted in needles that caused far less damage to the surrounding tissue during surgery than had earlier designs. The couple incorporated the company in 1945. Those types of needle, known as atraumatic surgical needles, became standard in operating rooms.         Mr. Sulzle died in 1963. His widow continued to manage B. G. Sulzle, assisted by a daughter and son-in-law, Lora and Alfred Flanagan.         Mrs. Sulzle was a supporter of civic, health-care and cultural institutions, including the SUNY Health Science Center at Syracuse, which received an endowed visiting professorship, the B. G. Sulzle-Richard Burleson Memorial Lecture Series in surgery.         Mrs. Sulzle is survived by two granddaughters who manage the company, Lee H. Flanagan of Syracuse, president, and Wendy R. Flanagan of Syracuse and Manhattan.       
         Dionis Coffin Riggs, a poet, author, newspaper columnist and civic leader who made Martha's Vineyard her home and her passion for the better part of a century, died on April 20 at Cleaveland House, the West Tisbury, Mass., boardinghouse where she had listened to seafaring tales as a child and told them as an old woman. She was 98 and had conducted her regular living room poetry seminar there less than a week before her death.         For someone who graduated from Girls' High School in Brooklyn, spent more than 30 years as a school principal's wife in Jersey City and had a later-life fling with poetry in Turkey, Mrs. Riggs had an uncommon attachment to Martha's Vineyard.         But as a descendant of Athearns, Mayhews, Butlers, Looks and other of the island's first families, Mrs. Riggs, who was born on Martha's Vineyard, in Edgartown, had its history in her blood and its turn-of-the-century sounds in her ears.         To the end of her life, Mrs. Riggs, who could remember when Edgartown's streets were paved with scallop shells, savored the recollected sounds of horses' hooves and wagon wheels crunching down Main Street.         She also had a keen ear for her sea captain grandfather's stories of adventure at sea and calamity at home. As Mrs. Riggs recounted it in her 1940 best seller, ''From Off Island,'' when her 28-year-old grandfather James F. Cleaveland returned from a voyage in 1852 with a 16-year-old Irish Catholic bride from Australia, his mother was not amused.         Indeed, the woman was so unwelcoming to her new daughter-in-law that the young woman talked her husband into taking her along on a five-year voyage. She returned triumphant with two daughters and enough tales to keep her granddaughter, Mrs. Riggs, enthralled for the rest of her life.         It was a family tragedy that gave Mrs. Riggs the opportunity to hear these and other tales firsthand. Her father, Thomas Coffin, a tea taster, left home when she was 3 and never returned, forcing her mother first to open a boardinghouse in Edgartown and later to leave her daughter with her parents to pursue teaching jobs in Pennsylvania and Brooklyn.         By the time Mrs. Riggs joined her mother for her high school years in Brooklyn, she had a fund of stories and a yen to tell them. But it was not until well after she had obtained a teaching certificate in New Jersey and had taught there just long enough to realize she couldn't stand it, that she began to find outlets.         After her 1922 marriage to Sidney Noyes Riggs, who worked as an experimenter with Thomas Edison before becoming a school principal, Mrs. Riggs, an inveterate club woman and volunteer, began writing plays for various women's clubs and later turned out numerous articles on Martha's Vineyard history.         A childhood interest in poetry had been suppressed. Her first effort drew such a bemused reaction from her older sisters, she later recalled, that she wrote no more poems for years. But after entering a poetry contest at the urging of a New Jersey friend and winning a $1 prize, Mrs. Riggs let go with a flood of pent-up poetry.         Her clear, simple and affecting poetic observations so delighted newspaper and magazine editors that she eventually published more than 1,000 poems, many in The Christian Science Monitor and her hometown newspaper, The Vineyard Gazette.         Mrs. Riggs, who always spent summers on Martha's Vineyard, retired there with her husband in 1954, and after his death in 1975 converted the sprawling family home into a bed and breakfast catering to poets.         When she visited a daughter in Turkey, where her son-in-law had been sent by the State Department, Mrs. Riggs became so involved with the local poetry scene that she helped translate hundreds of Turkish poems into English. Her desire to return and continue the work when she was almost 90 was thwarted because she failed to win a Fulbright Fellowship.         Mrs. Riggs, who was long active in virtually every civic organization in West Tisbury, especially enjoyed her weekly readings to schoolchildren (they called her ''cool'') and at a local nursing home, where she was older than her ''elderly'' listeners.         As the West Tisbury correspondent for The Vineyard Gazette, Mrs. Riggs always began her weekly column with a haiku (she enjoyed the challenge) and never overlooked an important event. Her last column, published two days before her death, included the news that a neighbor's goat had given birth to triplets.         She is survived by three daughters, Alvida Jones, Ann Fielder and Cynthia Riggs, all of West Tisbury; 14 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Katherine Esau, an international leader in studying plant structure who laid the foundation for much current research into plant function, died on June 4 at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 99.         ''She absolutely dominated the field of plant anatomy and morphology for several decades,'' said Dr. Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden. ''She set the stage for all kinds of modern advances in plant physiology and molecular biology. You have to understand the structure of plants first before you can unravel the questions of molecular biology.''         In 1989, President George Bush awarded Dr. Esau, professor emerita at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the National Medal of Science. Dr. Ray F. Evert, the Katherine Esau Professor of Botany and Plant Pathology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, who accepted the medal on her behalf, said she was the first full-fledged botanist to win that award. Dr. Esau (pronounced EE-saw) was also the sixth woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences, in 1957, the academy said.         Dr. Esau's long career, which began in czarist Russia and ended with the publication of her last research paper in 1990, reflected the methodological changes of this century. She started with techniques of agricultural research, plant selection and hybridization, then moved into light-microscope studies of plant anatomy and the damage caused by viruses.         Dr. Esau had planned to retire after she became professor emerita in 1965, but a fascination with electron microscopy led her to spend her final decades working in that area.         She studied plant development and the effects of viruses on plant tissues, and she did much work on phloem tissue, which transports food from a plant's leaves to its roots. And much of what she did pointed the way for  molecular studies by others.         Dr. Esau noticed that virus particles appeared to move from cell to cell along structures called plasmodesmata, which were smaller in diameter than the viruses they transported, and she suggested that if molecular biologists looked at this transport, they would learn a lot about cell function. That is in fact being done, Dr. Evert said.         ''She was the grande dame of American botany and probably worldwide botany as well,'' Dr. Evert said.         For many decades, Dr. Esau's ''Plant Anatomy,'' published by John Wiley & Sons in 1953 and updated in 1965, was the leading text on plant structure in the nation and was widely adopted abroad. Now a classic, it is being updated by Dr. Evert, who was a graduate student of Dr. Esau. He is also preparing a new edition of Dr. Esau's ''The Anatomy of Seed Plants,'' published by John Wiley & Sons in 1960 and updated by Dr. Esau in 1977.         Katherine Esau was born on April 3, 1898, in Yekaterinoslav, now Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. She studied agriculture for a year in Moscow, but her studies were interrupted by the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.         In 1918 she and her family, Mennonites of German descent, rode on a wagon for two weeks with other refugees to reach Germany, where she continued her agricultural training and worked on farms. In 1922 she graduated from the Berlin Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule, and she and her parents emigrated to the United States and settled in a largely Mennonite community in Reedley, Calif., near Fresno.         She soon joined the Spreckels Company near Salinas, Calif., where she worked on a sugar beet that would be resistant to the curly top virus. When she was invited to the University of California at Davis in 1927, she arrived with a truckload of beets and beet seed. While her work soon branched out, she revisited curly top virus in beets and other plants many times.         The Davis campus did not register graduate students at the time, so she registered at the Berkeley campus. While her thesis defense took place at Berkeley, which granted her a doctorate in 1931, her research was done on the Davis campus, and she joined the faculty there.         In 1963 Dr. Esau moved to the Santa Barbara campus with the intention of retiring in two years. But her interest in electron microscopy led her to keep working and publishing. She worked on revisions to ''Plant Anatomy'' until 1992.         There are no survivors.       
         Rachel Gillett Fruchter, the Brooklyn biochemist who died in a bicycle accident on Saturday, was known for her research in gynecological cancer, as well as her commitment to women's health issues. She was 57 and lived in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.         Dr. Fruchter was killed when a van struck her bicycle as she swerved, apparently to avoid some runners near the Kate Wollman skating rink. She was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center.         She was an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the State University of New York's Health Science Center at Brooklyn. Her research focused on gynecological cancer and the epidemiology of cancer.         Her investigations were reported in numerous scientific papers and led, among other things, to changes in the characterization of AIDS in women. She maintained a tumor registry at the SUNY Health Science Center.         She also was a founder of Health Right, an independent women's organization in New York. She was a contributor to ''Our Bodies, Our Selves: A Book By and For Women'' (Simon & Schuster). Compiled and updated by the Boston Women's Health Collective, the 25th anniversary edition was published last year.         Rachel Gillett was born in London and grew up wherever her father's profession as a botanist would take him. She graduated in biochemistry from Oxford University and earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Rockefeller University in 1966 and a master's degree in public health from Columbia University in 1973.         She joined the obstetrics-gynecology faculty at the SUNY center the following year. Her research established that immigrant women without access to adequate health care suffer higher rates of cervical cancer. She also investigated how the human papilloma virus related to AIDS.         With her husband, Norman, she was also active in community affairs and in educational matters. One of her principal concerns was the health care provided for women from the Caribbean islands and other immigrant populations throughout central Brooklyn.         Besides her husband, Dr. Fruchter is survived by a son, Lev, also of Brooklyn; a daughter, Chenda Fruchter of San Francisco; her mother, Gertrude Gillett of London, and three brothers, Simon, who lives  in Pakistan, and Matthew and Peter, both of London.       
         Judith Merril, one of the first female writers and editors to influence the direction of modern science fiction, died on Friday in Toronto, where she lived. She was 74.         During and just after World War II, Ms. Merril was the only woman associated with a group of young science fiction enthusiasts known as the Futurians, whose members included Isaac Asimov, James Blish, C. M. Kornbluth and Frederick Pohl. She and Mr. Pohl were married in 1949 and divorced in 1953.         At a time when science fiction was still dismissed as adolescent escapism by most academic critics, her first published story, in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1948, told of a mother's devotion to a baby horribly deformed by radiation-induced mutation. Her 1950 novel about nuclear war, ''Shadow on the Hearth,'' was adapted for television under the title ''Atomic Attack.''         Ms. Merril, who was born Juliet Grossman in New York City, adopted the name Judith Merril early in her career. She had lived in Canada since 1968.         She edited a well-received series of anthologies of the best science fiction from 1956 to 1970. In these collections she championed a self-consciously literary approach that became known in the mid-60's as the New Wave. By choosing stories from outside the usual magazines, she helped to broaden the horizons of science fiction writing. As part of her campaign to shift the focus away from scientific hardware, she fought a spirited if losing battle to redefine the genre as ''speculative fiction.''         Her 1968 anthology ''England Swings SF'' introduced many American readers to the experimental fiction of writers like Brian Aldiss and J. G. Ballard. One puzzled reviewer noted that stories like Ballard's ''Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race'' were ''closer to the world of Kafka and William Burroughs than to Asimov and Bradbury.''         Her donation to the Toronto Public Library of more than 50,000 books and periodicals formed the basis of the Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation and Fantasy, one of the major research libraries in the field.         Correction:  September 24, 1997, Wednesday         An obituary on Sept. 17 about Judith Merril, a science fiction writer and anthologist, misspelled the given name of her former husband. He is Frederik Pohl, not Frederick.       
         Myra Tanner Weiss, an unlikely Trotskyist whose radical vision of an egalitarian, collectivist society led her to organize migrant farm workers, rail against racism, make two quixotic mayoral races in Los Angeles and run for Vice President of the United States three times on the Socialist Workers Party ticket, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Indio, Calif. She was 80.         At first glance, Mrs. Weiss would hardly seem the type to be attracted to Leon Trotsky's version of Marxism, and not simply because she cut a stylish figure in leftist circles -- a small, attractive woman who was always immaculately turned out, generally in a well-cut suit of lush material run up by her husband's tailoring family.         Mrs. Weiss, who was on the Socialist Workers Party's national ticket in 1952, 1956 and 1960, was the daughter of an unabashed capitalist, Myron Tanner, who managed an investment syndicate before becoming a top insurance salesman in Los Angeles. And her roots were in Salt Lake City, a decidedly conservative city whose politics, customs and thinking tended to reflect the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.         But by the time she joined the Socialist Workers Party while attending the University of Utah in 1935, her family had already distanced itself from the Mormon Church. Her grandfather, Joseph Marion Tanner, an educator who was president of Utah State University, became so distraught when the church discontinued its doctrine of polygamy in 1890, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling that polygamy was not a permissible exercise of religious freedom, that he abandoned his six wives and fled to Canada.         Almost from the beginning, Mrs. Weiss was in the forefront of the socialist movement. Dropping out of college to follow her family to California, she took courses at the University of California at Los Angeles, but she soon left college, first to organize agriculture and cannery workers and later to help establish the Socialist Workers Party in Los Angeles, where she and another party organizer, Murry Weiss, began a romance that led to marriage.         After running for mayor of Los Angeles in 1945 and again in 1949, Mrs. Weiss and her husband came to New York, where he served as editor and she as a staff writer for the party's newspaper, The Militant.         A fiery speaker, Mrs. Weiss was chosen in 1952 as the running mate of the party's Presidential candidate, Farrell Dobbs, a onetime truck driver who had virtually created the teamsters' union as a national force before becoming a Socialist Workers official. But in three Presidential campaigns, party records show, the Dobbs-Weiss ticket polled a total of only 10,381 votes in 7 states in 1952, 7,799 votes in 4 states in 1956 and 40,328 votes in 12 states in 1960.         Partly because they believed that the party's democratic ideals were being overriden by oppressive bureaucratic controls, the Weisses withdrew in the 1960's, but Mrs. Weiss never abandoned her radical vision -- and paid a price for it.         In 1972, after receiving a degree in political science from New York University, she found she could not get a teaching job, and worked as a proofreader as a member of the International Typographical Union. In her later years, she championed feminism along with socialism.         Mrs. Weiss, whose husband died in 1981, is survived by two sisters, Shirley Nagel of La Quinta, Calif., and Martha Stinehart of Los Angeles, and two brothers, Norman Tanner of Salt Lake City and Dee Tanner of Pasadena, Calif.       
         Kathy Keeton Guccione, who helped found Penthouse magazine in the United States with her husband, Bob Guccione, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. She was 58 years old and lived in New York.         The cause was complications from surgery to bypass an obstruction in her upper digestive tract, according to Jackie Markham, a spokeswoman for General Media, the magazine's publisher. Breast cancer was diagnosed in Ms. Keeton in 1995.         Ms. Keeton, who used her maiden name, was president and chief operating officer of General Media Communications Inc., which publishes several magazines and runs other media operations on the Internet. She was also vice chairman of General Media International, the holding company that oversees the publishing arm.         Raised on a farm in South Africa and trained as a ballet dancer in London, Ms. Keeton became at age 24 what The Associated Press called ''one of the highest-paid strippers in Europe.''         She met Mr. Guccione that year when he was starting Penthouse in London and she became one of the company's first employees, selling advertising. The two began living together two years later but did not marry until 1988.         In 1969, Ms. Keeton helped Mr. Guccione establish Penthouse in the United States and co-founded the science magazine Omni in 1979 and the health magazine Longevity in 1989, both of which are now published only on the Internet.         Ms. Keeton was the author of two books, ''Longevity: The Science of Staying Young,'' published in 1992,  and ''Woman of Tomorrow,'' published in 1985.         She spent the last two and a half years of her life fighting to get what she considered a fair trial for the cancer drug, hydrazine sulfate, which Ms. Keeton credited with extending her life, according to Ms. Markham. Ms. Keeton also established the Kathy Keeton Cancer Research Foundation to encourage research in alternative and complementary cancer therapies.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Keeton is survived by five stepchildren; her brother, Keith Keeton of South Africa; her uncle, William Keeton of South Africa, and three cousins, also of South Africa.       
         Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the poorest of the world's poor, died yesterday in Calcutta, India, where she had lived since her work with the destitute began five decades ago. She was 87.         Mother Teresa was hospitalized several times last year with heart, lung, kidney and other problems, and also suffered ill health in earlier years. Her physician in Rome, Vincenzo Bilotta, said she suffered cardiac arrest during the evening at her convent in Calcutta, The Associated Press reported.         As her health deteriorated over the past year, Mother Teresa stepped aside and her order, the Missionaries of Charity, chose a new leader, Sister Nirmala, in March.         Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in what is now Macedonia, was revered in India, where she worked for 68 years and became a citizen.         She also came to be honored around the world for the compassionate, effective way she set up and oversaw projects to provide care and comfort to the very poor and the very sick, orphans, lepers and the dying.         Traveling widely even in her later years, she became known to millions as a slight, brown-eyed figure -- she was only 5 feet tall -- smiling and dressed in the plain white sari with blue trim of her order.         Her work was considered by some a rebuke to widespread feelings of personal powerlessness in middle-class and wealthy societies. In 1968, Pope Paul VI praised her as an ''intrepid messenger of the love of Christ.''         The Nobel Committee said its award to her in 1979 was ''for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress in the world, which also constitute a threat to peace.'' Informed of the honor, she said simply, ''I am unworthy.''         But she came in for criticism, too. A British television documentary in 1994 contended that perceptions of her were colored by ''hyperbole and credulity.''         Mother Teresa, who had been a school administrator in a suburb of Calcutta, began working in the slums of that poverty-ridden and densely populated city in 1948. She had received what she described as a divine ''call within a call'' two years earlier while riding on a train. ''The message was quite clear,'' she recalled. ''I was to help the poor while living among them. It was an order.''         In 1950 she established the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, becoming its Superior General. She went on to organize far-flung programs for the impoverished, eventually reaching more than 90 countries.         Her chief task, as she defined it, was to provide ''free service to the poor and the unwanted, irrespective of caste, creed, nationality or race.''         In predominantly Hindu India, she made sure that the priests of her order gave last rites, the Roman Catholic sacrament for the dying, only on request, and that they dealt with the dead according to the practices of the individual's own religion. For the living, Mother Teresa set up orphanages, schools in slums and Pure Heart Homes for sick and dying homeless people.         Over the years, her work expanded. She set up mobile health clinics, centers for the malnourished, rehabilitation hospices for lepers, homes for alcoholics and drug addicts, and shelters for the homeless. Her centers in the United States included the Gift of Love Hospice for 15 men with AIDS, at 657 Washington Street, in Greenwich Village.         The number of sisters in her religious order, only 62 in 1957, grew enormously. By the time Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize, her order had attracted 1,800 nuns and 120,000 lay workers, running more than 80 centers in India and more than 100 others in other parts of the world. The order's patients included 53,000 lepers.         By 1988, her order was operating 600 mobile health clinics where almost four million people received treatment. That year Mother Teresa visited South Africa, which was still under apartheid rule, to set up a hostel in a black township. By early 1992, experts on Catholic welfare work reported, members of her order -- 4,000 nuns and novices, 400 priests and brothers and hundreds of thousands of lay volunteers -- worked at 450 sites worldwide, including in Albania and Iraq.         Aid and Tribute, But No Pity         Mother Teresa often paid tribute to the stricken people she cared for. Speaking to a gathering at the United Nations in 1975, she recalled a woman she had found dying on a Calcutta street.         ''I knew she was dying,'' she said softly. ''After I did what I could, she took my hand, gave me a beautiful smile and thanked me. She gave me more than I gave her.''         Mother Teresa put particular emphasis on giving the deprived and the sick a sensation of dignity through personal contact. ''Ours is a humble service,'' she said in an interview in 1975. ''We try to remain right down on the ground.''         But she said pity did not help the poor. They ''don't need pity, they need love and compassion,'' she once said, adding, ''If you don't know them, you don't love them and don't serve them.''         She said some people used to advise her that her order should have fans in some rooms used by its nuns. ''I do not want them to have fans,'' she continued. ''The poor whom they are to serve have no fans. Most of the girls come from village homes where they had no fans. They should not be more comfortable here than at home.''         In addition to piety, humility and warmth, she displayed strength of will, blunt practicality and organizational talent. The Nobel Committee said it meant to honor her as much for her managerial skills as for her devotion to the poor.         Mother Teresa earned her Nobel Prize despite a political climate in India that was unfavorable to foreign missionaries. In the 1970's the Government took measures to discourage such work, and by the time she won the prize the number of missionaries in India had shrunk to only a few hundred. It had formerly been 6,000. In 1979 there were about 15 million Christians in the country, 2.4 percent of the population of 630 million.         On certain social questions, Mother Teresa adhered outspokenly to the doctrine of her church. She voiced strong opposition to contraception, abortion and divorce.         In accepting the Nobel Prize, she declared: ''To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations. The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.''         Strong Adherence To Church Doctrine         In 1995, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, she helped dedicate a shelter in Washington for women and newborn infants. The center was meant to discourage abortions by providing quarters for children waiting to be adopted or put in foster homes.         And in February 1996, Senator Bob Dole, campaigning in Iowa for the Republican Presidential nomination, declared that Mother Teresa had called to praise him for helping pass a ban against certain types of late-term abortions.         In 1995, before a referendum in Ireland was narrowly passed to end a constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, opponents of the law were exasperated when a hand-written letter from Mother Teresa urging a ''no'' vote was made public.         On another occasion, she contended in effect that women's place was in the home, ''allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.''         Criticism of her came from various quarters. In an interview in 1995 in Calcutta, Debasis Bhattachariya of the Indian Science and Rationalists Association declared, ''Mother Teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen, because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society.''         Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation, voiced particularly strong criticism of her in a 1995 book, ''The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice'' (Verso). Mr.  Hitchens contended that she had ''furnished P.R.-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen.'' Her success, he said, ''depends on the exploitation of the simple and the humble by the cunning and the single-minded.''         The Philadelphia Inquirer's review of the book carried the headline, ''A Salvo of Cheap Shots Fired at a Contemporary Saint.''         The 1994 British television documentary that criticized Mother Teresa, titled ''Hell's Angel,'' was also written by Mr. Hitchens. Asked about the documentary, Mother Teresa said simply, ''Forgive them for they know not what they do.''         In the United States, her views were of such wide interest that ''The Simple Path,'' a book of her thoughts, experiences and beliefs compiled by Lucinda Vardey, was a best seller for 12 weeks in 1995 and 1996.         She was ''an incredible person,'' President Clinton said yesterday in Edgartown, Mass., where he was on vacation. The House of Representatives, observed a moment of silence.         Answering the Call To Become a Nun         Mother Teresa was born Agnes Bojaxhiu on either Aug. 26 or 27, 1910, to Albanian parents in Skopje, about 200 miles south of Belgrade. Studded with churches and mosques, the city is today the capital of Macedonia, but was then ruled by Ottoman Turks, before becoming part of Serbia in 1913.         Accounts have differed as to the profession of her father. An authorized biography of her that came out in Britain in 1992 said he was a building contractor. While a schoolgirl, she belonged to a Catholic lay women's group. At its meetings, letters were read from Balkan Jesuits who had gone as missionaries to Bengal, in eastern India.         At the age of 12 she first felt the desire to become a nun. At 18 she decided to do so and got in touch with the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish Catholic order with missions in Bengal. She joined the order in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin, in 1928. After English lessons there, she spent a more than a year in Darjeeling, north of Calcutta, where the order ran a girls' school.         She then became a teacher, mainly of geography and also of history and catechism, at St. Mary's High School, on the grounds of the Entally Convent outside Calcutta. Many of her pupils came from poor families. In time she learned Bengali and Hindi and became the school's principal.         It was while riding on a train on Sept. 10, 1946, that she received her ''call within a call,'' she said. She left her school and learned nursing skills from other nuns. Then she began her good works among Calcutta's poor, feeling uncertainties at first but also happiness as she set about meeting peoples' needs. ''I knew where I belonged,'' she recalled, ''but I did not know how to get there.''         Before long -- in 1950 -- she won canonical recognition for her new order, the Missionaries of Charity. The religious sisters who joined took vows of chastity, obedience, poverty and service.         One day in 1952, as her longtime associate Sister Agnes recalled years later, ''she found an old woman dying in the streets.''         ''We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital,'' Sister Agnes said, ''but before we could, she died. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.''         And so Mother Teresa set about establishing a home for the dying destitute. She persuaded Calcutta's municipal authorities to give her a shabby one-story building, which happened to stand next to a complex of Hindu shrines.         In that humble structure, she succeeded in creating a place where those who died would do so with dignity. The space was cleaned. The dying were cared for with compassion. The establishment was called Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart.         Mother Teresa's undertakings continued, one after another. There was a home for abandoned children, a leper colony and an old people's home. She went on to set up welfare institutions ranging from a family clinic, to mobile leprosy clinics, to nurseries for abandoned children.         A Strong Disdain For Mere Money         Her work brought in donations from admirers. She liked to say that money was ''really no problem, we depend on divine providence,'' and she said simply that her works were underwritten by ''cash and kind.''         She recalled that when her order opened a house in New York, ''Terence Cardinal Cooke was very anxious that he should give every month a maintenance for the sisters.''         ''I didn't want to hurt him,'' she said, ''but I didn't know how to explain to him that our services are purely for the love of God and that we cannot accept maintenance. I expressed it the only way I could: 'Your Eminence, I don't think God is going to become bankrupt in New York City!' ''         One longtime source of support was Catholic Relief Services, the overseas aid agency of the United States bishops, which operates in scores of countries. Its backing came largely in donations of United States Government surplus food.         In 1971 Mother Teresa's order opened its first house in the United States, in Harlem. It was soon moved to the Bronx, where, on a visit to the United States in 1980, Mother Teresa helped open a soup kitchen and declared her thanks to the poor people of New York ''for allowing themselves to be taken care of'' by her order. In 1981, she opened a mission in Newark.         Then in 1982, when she was 72, she worked for a number of days in Beirut, Lebanon, crisscrossing the Green Line that divided Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. She rescued dozens of mentally ill children from the dangers of warfare in the Muslim part of the city.         One of her biographers, Eileen Egan, reported in a 1985 book, ''Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa -- the Spirit and the Work,'' that a Red Cross official who helped her observed later: ''What stunned everyone was her energy. We didn't expect a saint to be so efficient.''         After suffering heart problems, Mother Teresa sent her resignation as head of her order to Pope John Paul II early in 1990. She said the time had come for ''younger hands.'' A new head was to be chosen that September. But when the time came she told reporters in Calcutta that God's will had kept her from stepping down. Catholic clergymen said she had been prevented from doing so when members of the order's electoral college, gathered from many countries, had been unable to agree on her successor. They re-elected her to her post.         Over the years, she received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees from universities ranging from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome to Harvard. She was awarded the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award. And she was an honorary citizen of Assisi, the hill town in central Italy where Francis of Assisi was born in 1182.         In addition to all her good works, Mother Teresa found time to compose prayers, including this one:         Make us worthy, Lord,         To serve our fellow men         Throughout the world who live and die         In poverty or hunger.         Give them, through our hands         This day their daily bread,         And by our understanding love,         Give peace and joy.         But she could also be briskly prosaic. In an interview in 1994 she said: ''I work all day. That is the best way.''       
         Mary Sears, a researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for more than 60 years and a guiding editorial force behind several top scientific publications devoted to marine studies, died on Sept. 2 at her home in Woods Hole, Mass. She was 92.         Early in Dr. Sears's career, societal conventions prevented women from going to sea on research voyages, so Dr. Sears focused her energies on editing publications devoted to oceanography. She was the founding editor of Deep-Sea Research, a journal she directed from 1953 to 1974. She was also editor of the book ''Oceanography,'' a compendium of marine science published in 1961 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         From 1943 to 1946, Dr. Sears was a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, assigned to naval intelligence in Washington. While there, she organized and headed the Oceanographic Unit of the Navy Hydrographic Office, which until World War II had been mainly engaged in making and printing navigational charts. Under her guidance, the hydrographic agency evolved into the Naval Oceanographic Office.         Her duties included coordinating naval oceanographic research at Woods Hole, where, as part of the war effort, scientists studied such matters as the behavior of smoke at sea and the use of the temperature and water-density characteristics of ocean layers to help submarines avoid detection.         Mary Sears was born on July 18, 1905, in Wayland, Mass. She attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1927, a master's degree in 1929 and a doctorate in zoology in 1933. As a graduate student, she worked at Harvard University with Henry Bigelow, the founder and first director of Woods Hole.         In 1932 she began working as a planktonologist at Woods Hole, and was one of the first 10 staff research assistants at the Cape Cod institution, which was then primarily a summer operation. She was a research assistant at Harvard from 1933 to 1949, and an instructor at Wellesley College from 1938 to 1943.         Dr. Sears was the staff planktonologist at Woods Hole from 1940 to 1963, when she became a senior scientist in the biology department, a post she held until her retirement in 1970. She was named scientist emeritus in 1978.         Dr. Sears was chairwoman of the First International Congress on Oceanography, which was held at the United Nations in 1959. She was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society of Women Geographers and the American Geophysical Union.         She is survived by two sisters, Leila Sears of North Pomfret, Vt., and Elisabeth Laderoute of Princeton, N.J., and a brother, John, of Jamaica, West Indies.       
         Eleanor Pepper, a former chairwoman of Pratt Institute's department of interior design who was a longtime design consultant and decorated an early version of the United Nations Security Council meeting room, died on Sunday at her apartment in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan. She was 93.         Miss Pepper was a professor of interior design at Pratt Institute from 1950 to 1970 and headed the interior design department there from 1951 to 1959. She was concurrently a New York-based design consultant for more than two decades, beginning in 1950.         From 1945 to 1950, she was with the New York-based architectural firm of Voorhees, Walker, Foley, Smith doing interior design. It was in that capacity that, in 1946, she decorated the Security Council's new main meeting room. The space had formerly been a Hunter College gymnasium.         The Voorhees firm designed the new chamber, which was decorated in soothing shades of soft tan and buff, with off-color brown carpeting.         Miss Pepper was a Manhattan native and graduated in 1924 from Barnard College and received a B.S. in architecture in 1928 from Massachusetts Institute of Architecture and a Diplome des Etudes Superieures in 1933 from the Sorbonne.         Her work in the 1930's included collaborating on plans for new newsreel theaters in Paris and for remodeling brownstone houses on Manhattan's East Side.         Early in her career she was also an associate editor of House and Garden magazine, and for several years she headed the department of interior design at Stephens College in Missouri.         During World War II, Miss Pepper worked on the design of floating drydocks for Admiral Harris Engineers and then was on the architectural staff of the U.S.O.         She was a longtime associate member of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. In 1948, while she was chairwoman of the chapter's subcommittee on exhibitions, she oversaw the installation of an exhibit titled ''Tomorrow's World,'' sponsored by the chapter, in the New York Museum of Science and Industry in Rockefeller Center.         The exhibit's main feature was a 30-foot-wide, three-dimensional panorama depicting an ideal, two-square-mile community for 20,000 people with such then-modern features as pedestrian overpasses at main thoroughfares, and garden apartment houses and office buildings, both built low to give residents a feeling of country living.         Miss Pepper also was a professor in the architecture department of the New York Institute of Technology, taught and lectured elsewhere and remained active as a teacher into her 80's.         She is survived by two nieces, Carol Cooper of Lyonsville, N.Y., and Alice Cooper of Jerusalem, and by three nephews, D. Stephen Pepper of Lynchburg, Va., and Rome, Michael Pepper of New Windsor, Md., and Sam Hellinger of Pacific Palisades, Calif.       
         Katherine B. Oettinger, an authority on the care and upbringing of children, who was head of the Federal agency for the care of handicapped and underprivileged children, died on Monday in Carmel, Calif. She was 94.         Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957 as chief of the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Dr. Oettinger served four administrations. When the bureau was abolished in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her deputy assistant secretary for family planning and population. She retired from Government service in 1970 when the post was abolished in the Nixon Administration.         As an expert on retarded children, Dr. Oettinger expounded the view that such children could often be cared for in the home, and should be, though in an earlier time they were routinely sent to institutions. She was also intent on educating the nation about the difficult period of adjustment facing most parents of retarded children.         ''Some parents still blame themselves when they discover their child is retarded,'' she said, and then go from doctor to doctor looking for a ''cure,'' rather than counseling that will help them teach their children to learn to function with some degree of success.         Young parents, she said, particularly need help in evaluating whether the child can best be cared for at home, as 95 percent were by the 1960's, or in an institution. If the decision is the home, she said, careful parental training is needed in precise ways of giving consistent directions, for example, in using patterns of speech that the child can easily understand.         Dr. Oettinger received many awards and was called one of the nation's ''true heroines'' by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. After she left the Government, she traveled the world as a consultant on population control and family planning and wrote articles for social science journals and a well-received book, with Elizabeth C. Mooney, ''Not My Daughter: Facing Up to Adolescent Pregnancy'' (Prentice-Hall, 1979).         A native of Nyack, N.Y., she graduated from Smith College in 1925 with a degree in sociology and earned a master's degree in social work there.         Starting her career as a social worker in St. Paul, she moved to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, and then on to train nurses in the care of the handicapped in Scranton, Pa.         Her husband, Malcolm H. Oettinger, whom she married in 1930, died in 1963. She is survived by two sons, Malcolm Jr., of Chapel Hill, N.C., and John. B, of Los Angeles.         After her work in Scranton, she became director of community services in the Pennsylvania welfare department, working to improve mental health clinics and the training of welfare workers and ministers. She became the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University in 1954.         ''You'll never get rich as a social worker,'' she told her students. ''But the satisfaction comes from helping humanity -- it's a wonderful field.''       
         Dr. Mina S. Rees, a mathematician who broke new ground for women as a university administrator and a leader in the sciences, died on Saturday at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Upper East Side.         At home in abstract and applied mathematics, Dr. Rees was founding president of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York. She was the first woman elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest alliance of scientists in the world.         Dr. Rees was born in Cleveland. She went to school in New York, attended Hunter College High School and graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College in 1923. She completed graduate studies at Columbia University, where she also studied law. She received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1931.         In the meantime, in 1926, she returned to Hunter as a mathematics instructor. Dr. Rees was an associate professor during World War II, when she went to work for the Government, helping to direct research in  modern mathematics for the war effort.         Dr. Rees was trained in pure algebra, but she was gifted with common sense and a knack for the practical, which stood her in good stead in dealing with the military.         ''I could sass the admirals as the men couldn't,'' she recalled later.         She was sent to the applied mathematics panel of the National Defense Research Committee in the Office of Research and Development.         By 1946, she was head of the mathematics branch of the Office of Naval Research, a position that she held until 1949, after which she was deputy director of the entire science division until 1953.         She worked on projects like fluid flow to solve antisubmarine problems, hydrofoil designs and early rocketry. She was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit and the British Medal for Service in the Defense of Freedom.         Dr. Rees also had an important role in the growth and diversification of mathematical studies. Many of her ideas left their mark on fast computer technology.         Dr. Rees returned to Hunter in 1953, as a professor and dean of students. She was responsible for academic affairs, including curriculum development, admissions standards, faculty recruitment and budgeting for teaching and research.         She became the first dean of graduate studies at CUNY in 1961, when the university drew up its doctoral programs. She was named president of the graduate division in 1969 and president of the newly consolidated Graduate School and University Center on 42d Street in 1971, before retiring the next year.         Dr. Rees was a Presidential appointee to the board of the National Science Foundation from 1964 to 1970, and she was active in the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, among other groups.         Dr. Rees enjoyed a crowning moment in 1969, when the 120,000-member American Association for the Advancement of Science elected her president. Women remained something of a rarity at that level in the scientific community, but she -- as  Marie Curie, Lisa Meitner and Dr. Margaret Mead before her -- had proved that scientific creativity was not just for men.         Dr. Rees's husband, Dr. Leopold Brahdy, died in 1977.       
         Marian E. Koshland, an immunologist and professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the ways antibodies fight off disease, died on Tuesday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley. She was 76 and lived in Lafayette, Calif.         The cause was lung cancer, the university said.         Dr. Koshland, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the president of the American Association of Immunologists in 1982 and 1983, discovered that antibodies differ in their amino acid composition, a factor that makes them extremely efficient at fending off disease.         She made the discovery by studying a molecule of phosphate and a molecule of arsenate. The two substances are somewhat similar chemically, but she found that they produced distinct and noticeably different antibodies when exposed to an antigen.         She also discovered a molecular chain that allows antibodies to be exported from a cell and to circulate in the bloodstream.         In 1991 she and her colleagues at Berkeley described the characteristics of a pathway that apparently serves as an intracellular superhighway, bypassing normal intracellular communication channels and making possible the proliferation of B-cells, which are essential in fighting off infection.         Dr. Koshland, who was born in New Haven on Oct. 25, 1921, received a bachelor's degree from Vassar College in 1942, a master's degree from Vassar the next year and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1949. During World War II, she worked on a research team that produced a vaccine for cholera, and in 1945 and 1946 she was a research assistant on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.         After two years as a fellow in the department of bacteriology at Harvard University, she joined the staff of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, first as an associate bacteriologist in the biology department and, from 1963 to 1965, as a bacteriologist.         She moved to Berkeley in 1965 as an associate research immunologist in the virus laboratory. In 1966, she became a lecturer in the department of molecularly biology. She was named a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology in 1970, and headed the department from 1982 to 1989.         Dr. Koshland, who was also the head of the graduate affairs division in the department, was a member of the National Science Board from 1976 to 1982 and of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences. She had continued to do research in her laboratory until recently.         She is survived by her husband, Daniel E. Koshland Jr., a biochemist at Berkeley and a former editor of the journal Science; five children, Ellen Koshland McCaughey of Melbourne, Australia; Phyllis Koshland of Paris; James, of Palo Alto, Calif.; Gail Koshland Wachtel of Tucson, Ariz., and Douglas, of Baltimore, and nine grandchildren.       
         Dr. Sigrid Phyllis Stearner, who studied the biological effects of radiation and campaigned for career opportunities for scientists with disabilities, died on Nov. 17 at the Illinois Independent Living Center at Naperville, Ill. She was 78.         The cause was pneumonia, friends said.         Dr. Stearner had cerebral palsy as a child and used a motorized wheelchair. She conducted research at the Argonne National Laboratory on the effects of ionizing radiation on the heart and blood vessels until she retired in 1981.         Dr. Stearner was treasurer of the Foundation for Science and the Disabled of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         She was born in Chicago and earned her bachelor's and doctorate at the University of Chicago.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rosemarie Rogers, a scholar of international migrations and former academic dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, died on Nov. 28 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 61.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone-marrow cancer, said her husband, Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering at Harvard University.         Dr. Rogers was a native of Austria, and her fluency in several languages led her to a career in international relations. She lectured in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving to the Fletcher School, where she advanced to a full professorship and served as academic dean from 1985 to 1987.         Her more than 50 papers, monographs, book chapters and books reflected her research on international migrations, including forced migrations and refugee policies.         At her death she was completing a comparative study of the migration policy of six Western European countries. In it she documented the difficulties host countries have, on the one hand, encouraging migrants to return home, and on the other, integrating them into their own societies.         Her recent research was foreshadowed in an earlier book, ''Guests Come to Stay: The Effects of European Labor Migration on Sending and Receiving Countries'' (1985). Another volume, written with Emily Copeland, ''Forced Migration: Policy Issues in the Post-Cold War World'' (1993), was widely distributed by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and various national governments.         Dr. Rogers was born Rosemarie Straussnigg in Klagenfurt, Austria, and studied at the Universities of Vienna and Innsbruck, the University of Texas and the Sorbonne. She settled in the United States in 1958 and earned a doctorate in political science at M.I.T. in 1967.         She served on the board of the World Peace Foundation.         Besides her husband, Dr. Rogers is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Cambridge, and Justin, of Albuquerque, N.M.       
         Veronica Geng, an accomplished parodist who spun out biting pieces for The New Yorker based on chance remarks by hapless politicians and the banalities of wedding announcements, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said a friend, Barbara Epstein, editor of The New York Review of Books. She was 56.         The cause was a brain tumor, said  Philip Roth, the novelist, who was also a friend.         As a writer of ''casuals,'' the short articles that appear in The New Yorker, she carried on in the tradition of S. J. Perelman. A typical Geng piece was a crazed amalgam of stock phrases, as in an imaginary wedding announcement reprinted in her 1984 collection, ''Partners'': ''The bride, married at the Presbyterian Church and Trust, is an alumna of the Royal Doulton School and Loot University.  Her father is retired from the family consortium. She is also a descendant of Bergdorf Goodman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her previous marriage ended in pharmaceuticals.''         Her 1988 collection, ''Love Trouble Is My Business,'' included a ''letter'' from the proprietor of a dog kennel to ''Secretary Weinberger'' about a defense contractor's $87.25 bill for dog boarding: ''I wear the key to the pantry around my neck on a platinum chain, and not only is the level of the kibble bin measured twice a day but the bin itself is equipped with a state-of-the art laser lock, which cannot be opened without a microcoded propylene wafer.''         Ms. Geng was also an unofficial editor of Mr. Roth's novels. ''I always gave Veronica my books,'' he said shortly before she died.         Ms. Geng was born in 1941 in Atlanta. Her father was a career Army officer. She once told The Christian Science Monitor that she traced her humor to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' read to her from the age of 2. In it, she said, she discovered ''a sense of illogic and how funny illogic is.''         That book ''and the paperback collection of the Watergate transcripts are my two favorite books.'' Ms. Geng said. ''They're not unlike each other.''         She attended the University of Pennsylvania. In the mid-1970's her short parody of the film critic Pauline Kael, published in The New York Review of Books, caught the eye of Roger Angell, a fiction editor at The New Yorker. Mr. Angell gave her a tryout and she went on to become his  assistant.         Mr. Roth credits Ms. Geng with persuading William Shawn, then The New Yorker's editor, to publish his 1979 novella, ''The Ghost Writer,'' in two parts. From then on, he said, he  came to depend on her.         Charles McGrath, a friend and colleague at The New Yorker who is now editor of The New York Times Book Review, said: ''Her thing was high, intellectual comedy.''         In 1992, after Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker, Ms. Geng and Ms. Brown had a falling out. Ms. Geng said she was dismissed; Ms. Brown said she resigned.         Ms. Geng had no immediate survivors.         Correction:  January 1, 1998, Thursday  An obituary of the parodist and editor Veronica Geng on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Steve Geng of Manhattan.       
         Ruth G. Weintraub, an early advocate of graduate education for women and a former dean at Hunter College, died Wednesday at her home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She was 92.         Dr. Weintraub, who also kept a home on Fire Island in Seaview, was a professor of political science at Hunter from 1951 to 1972. After retiring from academia, she had a second career with the Academy for Educational Development in Manhattan, starting as a consultant. The academy is a nonprofit organization that undertakes education projects.         She founded its Presidential Services Division in 1974 and was executive vice president of the academy from 1978 to 1988. Through the division, she helped recruit presidents for colleges around the country. She retired in 1988.         Born in New York and a lifelong resident, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College in 1929, and in 1931, she became one of the first women to finish New York University Law School with a J.D. She earned a Ph.D. in political science at Columbia University in 1939.         She joined the Hunter faculty as an instructor after her graduation in 1929 and advanced to full professor in 1951. In 1956, she became dean of graduate studies in the arts and sciences, and she held the post until 1968.         Dr. Weintraub was also chairwoman of the department of political science until 1960 and then associate dean of graduate studies at City University of New York until 1968. After that she was dean of social sciences for her four final years at Hunter.         She was president of Pi Sigma Alpha, the first woman to head that political science honor society, which has chapters at 107 institutions of higher education nationwide. She also was active as an officer in the American Society for Public Administration, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Jewish Welfare Board and the YM-YWHA of Greater New York.         Her husband, Dr. Solomon Weintraub, a pathologist, died in 1982 after 52 years of marriage. She is survived by a son, Jon, of Washington, and two grandchildren.
