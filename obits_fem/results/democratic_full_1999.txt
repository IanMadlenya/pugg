         Virginia Eloise Peterson Abelson, a former bookstore owner and past Democratic Party district leader who also worked in publishing and created crossword puzzles, died on Sunday at her home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Abelson, a native of Red Oak, Iowa, graduated in 1948 from the University of Iowa, where she majored in English.         During the 1950's, she worked as an advertising director for Cambridge University Press of New York.         In the 1960's, she owned a store called Books Unltd. in Croton. For about 15 years, into the 1980's, she also contributed crossword puzzles that were published in The New York Times.         In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Abelson was a party district leader in Croton. She was also a member of the board of the Croton Community Nursery School.         Mrs. Abelson is survived by her husband, Alan, a columnist for Barron's magazine; a daughter, Reed Abelson of Manhattan, a business reporter at The Times; a son, Justin, of Greenfield, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her cold war memoir published and praised as a literary event, died on Tuesday at her home in Berlin. She was 83.         Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to promote her new book, ''Love in Exile,'' published in March by Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.         The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, to a stint at the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other literati. She also wrote of her consuming romance with Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and antifascist whom she married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.         ''Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and gripping portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New York Times Book Review  found the book most affecting when Ms. Anderson recounted her domestic anguish and search for love outside the marriage.         In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.         ''Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only $5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me joyously. 'You're just the person I need!' He told me he was cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''         She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker. But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:         '' 'I'll break you in,' he said.         '' 'In three days?         '' 'Less.' ''         She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as cultural editor. ''My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx said, was a struggle and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''         Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly afterward, she met Mr. Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New York.         After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years, although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia, who still lives in Berlin.         In ''Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ''What right have you to deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.'' The book ends in 1962.         Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. ''She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope that a just society could be built,'' she said.         But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death throes of the German Democratic Republic as Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ''a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,'' as she described it.         In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology, ''Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions and take up the taboo subject of politics.         The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans  ''had just about had it,'' she wrote.         '' 'I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.         '' 'Six months,' she replied.''         Her grandson grew alarmed and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him. ''But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had had broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice, 'Enough!'         ''The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The unthinkable happened here.''         At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former West Germans ''tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it with inferior ''Western goods.''         Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and graduated in 1937 from New College, a division of Teachers College at Columbia University. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.         Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ''Gelbes Licht'' (''Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ''Wo Ist Katalin? (''Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977. From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York National Guardian.         Mr. Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging her fatal stroke.         But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi of Manhattan, said any infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New School for Social Research on March 25.         ''She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ''but the people would not let her stop.''       
         Lois Borwick Herman Rivkin, the founder and president of an organization linking business organizations and cultural institutions to New York City public schools, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69.         Mrs. Rivkin had lymphoma for the last six and a half years, her husband, Donald H. Rivkin, said. Though she had undergone eight courses of painful chemotherapy, she continued her work for the organization, Friends of the Public Schools, until early this year.         Rudy Crew, the New York City Schools Chancellor, noted that during her illness, she displayed the same energy she had shown in 1988 when she founded the organization that sought to introduce public school students to the city's cultural and business communities and vice versa. ''After each hospitalization, she would reappear regularly in my office and in so many classrooms that indeed, she seemed to be everywhere,'' said Dr. Crew. ''Children were Lois Rivkin's reason to live.''         The idea for Friends of the Public Schools grew out of volunteer work Mrs. Rivkin did in promoting the city's lesser-known cultural attractions during the Statue of Liberty centennial in 1986. At that time she organized a group called the View From the Torch, which produced maps and treasure hunts to spotlight hundreds of museums, libraries, parks and cultural sites in all five boroughs.         Though she was born in Denver and attended Goucher College in Baltimore, she arrived in New York in 1952 to work for the Carnegie Endowment for Peace and very quickly became what her husband described as ''the most passionate of New Yorkers.'' Her involvement with the View From the Torch project convinced her that there was very little interaction between business and arts communities and the public schools. She committed herself to establishing such ties, certain that they would enrich the entire city.         Among its initiatives, Friends of the Public Schools has organized an annual display of art by public school students at Sotheby's. It has arranged to have student chefs cater corporate conferences and civic observances and for students to present choral and instrumental concerts throughout the city.         Mrs. Rivkin was also a founder of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and in 1976 she served as the coordinator of volunteers at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.         In addition to her husband of 45 years, she is survived by two sons, David of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Daniel of Paris; a daughter, Judith Davison of New York; a brother, Harry H. Herman of Washington, and seven grandchildren.         She had received a number of honors including citations from the city and the Board of Education. On Feb. 16, the Citizens Committee for New York City presented her with a special New Yorker for New York Award. Some 1,200 people turned out that night, and one of the attendees  noted how vital Mrs. Rivkin appeared despite her illness. ''She even danced,'' he said.       
         Vanessa Brown, who originated the role of the girl upstairs in the Broadway production of ''The Seven Year Itch,'' a role played in the film version by Marilyn Monroe, died on Friday at the Motion Picture Country Home in Los Angeles, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, her son, David, said.         Born Smylla Brind in Vienna, Ms. Brown was blessed with beauty and  an I.Q. of 165 that she said made her feel ''squirmy.'' Her family fled the Nazis when she was 9, moving first to France and then to New York, where she came to the attention of the Broadway producer Herman Shumlin. He offered her the role of a 10-year-old Viennese girl in his production of Lillian Hellman's play ''Watch on the Rhine.'' Her parents refused to allow her to leave school, so she understudied Ann Blyth but later stepped into the role.         While in Chicago with the play, she was a guest on the radio show ''Quiz Kids,'' and did so well that she was offered and accepted a regular spot on the panel. After two years, she returned to New York, then moved to Los Angeles, where she made her first movie, ''Youth Runs Wild'' (1944), at age 16. While in college  she signed up with 20th Century Fox, and appeared in such movies as ''Tarzan and the Slave Girl'' (1950), in which she swung from trees with Lex Barker; ''The Heiress,'' and ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''         Ms. Brown returned to Broadway in 1952. Her stage career included the tour of ''As You Like It'' with Katharine Hepburn.         In later years Ms. Brown turned to politics and writing. She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic Convention and was active in the Presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. As a freelance correspondent for the Voice of America, she covered topics including  politics, science and medicine.         She is survived by her son, David, and a daughter, Cathy, both of Los Angeles.       
         Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where she lived. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a spokesman with the United States Embassy in Santiago.         Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington, said,  ''Anyone who was involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially taking the lead, was courageous.''         In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting of those who vanished under General Pinochet and prosecution of those involved in their deaths.         In the past year, she led protests in London in support of General Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83, is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years in power, from 1973 to 1990.         ''The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family. She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in 1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later, mother of three children.         In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American Government, General Pinochet overthrew the Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Mr. Pizarro, a Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret police run by the Chilean armed forces.         More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under General Pinochet are still unaccounted for.         Two days after Mr. Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed her the time to search for her husband and work with the Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.         In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son, Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and sisters.         Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Mr. Pizarro hanging around her neck.         Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from prosecution .         Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.         Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of General Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization called ''They Dance Alone.''         The current democratic Government in Chile issued a statement mourning Ms. Sierra's death.         Secretary General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the Government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must have felt. ''Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without knowing the truth,'' Mr. Mladinic said. 'I hope that in the near future this pain will end.''       
         Elizabeth Forsling Harris, who was briefly the first publisher of Ms. magazine, died on July 14 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 77.         She died in a hospital of complications from emphysema, said a friend, Patricia Reilly.         Ms. Harris helped start Ms. magazine in late 1971, but she left after the first issue, citing disagreement on a wide range of issues.         In 1975, she filed a suit for $1.7 million against the first editor of Ms., Gloria Steinem, and Pat Carbine, the publisher, contending that they had fraudulently misrepresented the value of the magazine's stock. The suit was dismissed.         After Ms. magazine, Ms. Harris worked in the early days of cable television, developing a shopping service called Cable Catalog with Neiman Marcus. In 1976, she became the publisher of Working Woman. In the early 1980's, she was a deputy commissioner at the New York State Department of Commerce.         Ms. Harris was born in Greeneville, Tenn., on Jan. 8, 1922, and graduated from Mount Vernon College in Washington.         In 1941, she took a job at Newsweek in New York as a researcher. She later became a radio and television editor. In 1951, she joined ABC, where she produced a program featuring Walter Winchell, and was one of the network's first programming executives.         Two years later, she left to start her own public relations company in Dallas, where she remained through the late 1950's, until she became a special consultant for Arthur Godfrey Productions in New York.         In 1961, she was the deputy associate director of the Peace Corps. She returned to Dallas in July 1963 and was the local White House liaison for President John F. Kennedy's visit on Nov. 22, 1963.         After the Kennedy assassination, she returned to Washington, where she again worked for the Peace Corps and the Democratic National Committee.         She later worked for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. in New York, the Urban Institute research organization in Washington and CRM Inc., in Del Mar, Calif., the publisher of Psychology Today.         Ms. Harris was the first president of the Women's Forum, a networking organization, served on the board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and was a trustee of Mount Vernon College and Tusculum College in Tusculum, Tenn.         No immediate survivors were reported.       
         Judith Campbell Exner, who asserted in a 1988 interview in People magazine that she had been having an affair with John F. Kennedy when he was elected President, died late Friday at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles.         She was 65 and lived in Orange County.         The cause was breast cancer, The Associated Press reported.         Over the years, Mrs. Exner gave varying accounts of her supposed relationship with Kennedy. But as Jeff Greenfield wrote in a review of Mrs. Exner's autobiography, ''My Story'' (1977), in The New York Times Book Review, she ''sought no publicity, at least until after a Senate committee investigating C.I.A.-Mafia connections summoned her to testify and press reports revealed her supposed connections to Kennedy'' and to Sam Giancana, a Chicago organized-crime figure.         Former aides maintained that Kennedy had not had an affair with Mrs. Exner, who was then Judith Campbell. Dave Powers, a Kennedy aide who Mrs. Exner said had assisted in setting up her encounters with the President, said in 1991, ''The only Campbell I know is chunky vegetable soup.''         In the 1988 interview, Mrs. Exner also said Kennedy had her arrange more than 10 meetings with Giancana, whom she said was also her lover. She said the meetings concerned, among other things, Kennedy's need for Giancana's help in the Democratic Presidential primary in West Virginia.         But Giancana's daughter, Antoinette, said that Giancana disliked Kennedy and that he never mentioned any contact with Kennedy while he was President.         Mrs. Exner also said that while Kennedy was in the White House she shuttled messages -- on topics including a plan to kill President Fidel Castro of Cuba -- between him and Giancana.         Kitty Kelley, who interviewed her for People, said Mrs. Exner received about $50,000 for the interview.         In Vanity Fair in 1996, Mrs. Exner said she had ended the affair, which she said had lasted two years, because she did not like being dubbed ''the other woman.''         She also said she had an abortion after becoming pregnant with Kennedy's baby, almost a year before Kennedy was assassinated.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Exner was born Judith Immoor and was reared in California. Her marriage to an actor, William Campbell, which ended in divorce after six years, helped her make contacts within the entertainment industry.         After her divorce, she dated Frank Sinatra, and through him she met Kennedy in 1960 in Las Vegas, Nev., said her lawyer, James Lesar of Washington.         She married a professional golfer, Dan Exner, in the mid-1970's and moved to Orange County. They reportedly divorced several years ago.         Mrs. Exner is survived by a son, David Bohrer; two brothers, Allen and Fred Immoor; and a sister, Joan Collingwood.         Editors' Note:  September 30, 1999, Thursday  An obituary on Monday reported the death of Judith Campbell Exner. It quoted assertions she had made over the years that she had had an affair with John F. Kennedy before and after he was elected President.         The article reported that aides of President Kennedy's, including Dave Powers, denied the affair. But it should also have reflected what is now the view of a number of respected historians and authors that the affair did in fact take place. The evidence cited by various authorities in recent years has included White House phone logs and memos from J. Edgar Hoover.       
         Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and painting in the 1960's and then left the New York art world for self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation Center in Texas.  She was 68 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's cousin.         Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum. They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body, intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of tools.         By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism, making nearly monochromatic ''Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960's she also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life. These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art world that bordered on hostility.         Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art, attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her ''Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and letting them fall where they may. In ''Transistor Radio Piece'' she listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.         In 1969 and 1970 Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the art world in works that she titled ''General Strike Piece'' and ''Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.         Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. A brief marriage in the late 1950's to an architect, Adrian Lozano, ended in divorce. She leaves no survivors.         Ms. Lozano had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries, Mitchell Algus, Rosen & Van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ''Wave'' paintings and notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these exhibitions were men.       
         Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition from Bangladesh.         As the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about 10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on Wednesday in Dhaka.         Born into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious fundamentalism.         ''This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the ceremony. ''This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building up womenfolk as self-reliant.''         Sufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer. As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education, but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's encouragement.         She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and Mr. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married Kamaluddin Ahmed.         In addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three great-granddaughters.         She published her first story at 14,  and her prose and poems drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions. She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.         ''The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview earlier this year. ''There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family also believed that women should stay out of it.         ''But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali from people working in the house.'' That became the language she used for her writing.         Though she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970's she worked to help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the Bangladeshis considered war criminals.         In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.         ''My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ''Be poor or middle class or upper class, the violence against women in family, society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited and deprived of opportunities.''         In 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her execution as punishment for her denunciation of the fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of reprisals.         Ms. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have appeared in her poems rather than her prose.         One poem, ''Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with the following lines:         For our language many have died,         drawn from the arms of our mother         but down the road, smeared with their blood         I hope freedom will come to this land:         the simple language of a simple people         Will meet the demands of this our land.         Before her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried. Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview earlier this year, suggest why.         ''Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said. ''Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack courage.''       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Margaret A. Greenfield, a founder and officer of the Independent Journalism Foundation and a dealer in art, antiques and real estate, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 74.         She had cancer, said her husband, James L. Greenfield.         Beginning in the 1950's, Mrs. Greenfield was an art and antiques dealer in London, Washington and finally Manhattan, where for about the last 25 years she owned and ran an antiques shop, Marco Polo, on Madison Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets. It closed about a year ago.         She also renovated and resold brownstones on the Upper East Side.         Mrs. Greenfield was active in the Independent Journalism Foundation from its inception in 1991. The foundation, based in Manhattan, teaches citizens of former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe about working as journalists in newly democratic societies.         She was the foundation's treasurer and one of its founders, along with her husband and Donald M. Wilson, a former vice president of Time Inc. Mr. Greenfield, a former foreign correspondent for Time magazine and former assistant secretary of state, is now a consulting member of the editorial board at The New York Times, where he has also been foreign editor and later an assistant managing editor.         Mrs. Greenfield created and furnished the foundation's four centers in Eastern European capitals -- in Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest and Budapest.         Margaret Ann Schwertley Greenfield was born in Gooding, Idaho. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho and worked as a stewardess for United Airlines and then for Pan American World Airways.         She met Mr. Greenfield when she was based in Hong Kong in the early 1950's, while she was Pan Am's first stewardess based in the Far East. They were married in 1954.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Anne Schwertley of Manhattan and Jane Schwertley of Gainesville, Fla.
