         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.         She moved to New York to be a school librarian in Scarsdale from 1939 to 1942. She was a librarian and professor of library service at New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton from 1942-54, with a two-year leave as a visiting professor at the University of Teheran and library adviser to Iran. She also taught at the University of Virginia and Emory University.         After her retirement from Rutgers, she served as a library consultant and later vice president of Bro-Dart Inc., a wholesale book supplier. She wrote and edited numerous articles and books on libraries.         Her survivors include a sister, Lydia Harvey, also of Danville.       
         Wanda Mary Jablonski, an expert on the international oil industry and founder of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly newsletter, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said Edward L. Morse, the newsletter's publisher.         Ms. Jablonski's career began when she landed a big story in 1945 while still an office messenger at the Journal of Commerce in Manhattan. Filling in for the oil reporter and assigned to cover a news conference conducted by a Venezuelan official, she waited until the session ended to corner him for a private interview. In the interview, he disclosed plans to seize and nationalize all foreign oil operations in Venezuela. He also called for joint action by developing countries with oil reserves, an idea that culminated in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960. Savoir-Faire Was Helpful         Ms. Jablonski became the Journal's oil editor and "the most influentual oil journalist of her time," as Daniel Yergin wrote in his history of the oil business, "The Prize" (Simon & Schuster, 1990). He added that she had the "savoir-faire required to get her through all sorts of situations."         Making her way in a male-dominated industry, she befriended Texas wildcatters, Arab sheiks, corporate executives and important government figures around the globe. She traveled often, once spending six months in the desert; on a visit to Saudi Arabia, she found herself housed in the guest quarters of the king's harem.         McGraw-Hill hired her in 1954 as senior editor of its new Petroleum Week, but the magazine folded in 1961. Jobless, she founded her own weekly, which was 8 to 12 pages and printed on yellow paper. It grew steadily to a circulation in the thousands, despite an annual subscription fee in the hundreds of dollars. The current price is $1,375.         Her newsletter became required reading in the industry for information on explorations, refining, supplies, prices and political trends. The readership ranged from Central Intelligence Agency officials to Middle East rulers. Her early reports on oil company plans occasionally enraged executives, who sometimes temporarily canceled their subscriptions in protest. She sold the weekly in 1988 to the Petroleum Intelligence Group. Born in Czechoslovakia         Ms. Jablonski was born in Czechoslovakia. Her mother was a physicist; her father, Eugene, worked for the Socony Oil Company, and the family followed him around the world to England, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Texas, Europe and Morocco.         After settling in the United States in 1938, Ms. Jablonski earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1942 and a master's in journalism from Columbia University in 1943.         In recent years she worked for the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in Manhattan as the director of the National High-Risk Registry for women with a family history of breast cancer. She donated $3 million to the center.         She was married and divorced three times. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Shirley Jenkins, a noted social work researcher, author and educator, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Jenkins wrote 10 books and was the founding director of the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice. The center is co-sponsored by Columbia University's School of Social Work and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. It seeks to integrate academic theory and clinical practice.         She taught at Columbia for 25 years until her retirement two years ago. She was chairwoman of Columbia's Advisory Committee for Ethnic Studies and served on its Commission on the Future of the University, the University Senate and the Faculty Executive Committee. Served on Several Panels         She was director of research training in social work and mental health for the National Institutes of Health from 1977 to 1988. She was also a member of the United States Department of Health and Human Services's expert panel, the New York State Advisory Committee on Refugee Mental Health and the New York City Task Force on Minorities in Child Care.         Among the issues she studied for government and private agencies were cultural factors in providing social services to new immigrants, family welfare programs, foster care, Social Security and the shortchanging of minorities and the poor in the allocation of park and recreation services.         Born Shirley Presberg in New York City, she earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College, a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from New York University.         Early in her career she focused on international affairs. From 1944 to 1948 she was the associate editor of Far Eastern Survey, a journal. From 1948 to 1950 she was a political officer for the United Nations Department of Security Council Affairs. She also wrote "American Economic Policy Toward the Philippines" (Stanford University, 1954).         Her husband, David, died in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Peter, of Queens and Ian of Manahttan, and three grandchildren.       
         Cecile L. Naumburg, a philanthropist and former board member of Carnegie Hall and other cultural organizations, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital.  Mrs. Naumburg was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by respiratory failure, her family said.         She was born in Philadelphia and went to the Friends Select School there. Her first husband, W. Maurice Steppacher, who was vice president and treasurer of the WDAS radio station in Philadelphia, died in 1936.         In 1937 she moved to New York City and married George W. Naumburg, an investment banker. They also had a second home in New City, N.Y.         Sharing her husband's love of music, Mrs. Naumburg served as a director on the boards at the Greenwich School of Music, the Friends of French Opera and the Naumburg Park Concerts. Family contributions helped build the Naumburg bandshell in Central Park. She was also a longtime board member of the Day Schools Association.         She is survived by two sons, Walter Steppaccher of Sarasota, Fla., and John Steppacher of Waccabuc, N.Y.; a daughter, Doris Judell of White Plains; two stepsons, George Naumburg of North Salem, N.Y., and Philip Naumburg of Sante Fe, N.M.; a stepdaughter, Ellen London of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Mercedes (Chiquita) Gregory, a documentary film maker and an influential figure in experimental theater, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 56 years old and lived in Santa Ynez, Calif.         She had breast cancer for three years, said her husband, Andre, the stage and film director and actor.         Mrs. Gregory directed a number of documentaries, including three dealing with the Polish director Jerzy Grotowski; the last, "Art as Vehicle," completed in 1990, examined his complex work process. Her other films include "Rings on the Water," a documentary about peace movements in the United States and the Soviet Union. Joseph Papp presented that film at the Public Theater in 1983.         In the 1970's, she was the executive director of an organization called A Bunch of Experimental Theaters. In that role, she was responsible for the administration and touring of a number of New York City avant-garde theaters. A strikingly beautiful woman, she also appeared on the cover of the first issue of Lear's magazine.         Mrs. Gregory was born in Bremen, Germany, and graduated from the University of Geneva and Ecole des Interpretes in Geneva. She spent most of her life in the United States. After many years in New York, she and Mr. Gregory moved to Santa Ynez last year. She recently completed a film script, "My Mother's Lover," about her life in Europe during World War II.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, an actor, and a daughter, Marina, both of Manhattan, and by a brother, Fred Nebelthau of Bremen. Funeral services will be held Friday at 10 A.M. at St. Thomas More's Church, 65 East 89th Street, Manhattan.       
         Taraja Linda Fraser Samuel, an important figure in the development of the New York City Board of Education's Mentoring Program, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. A resident of Brooklyn, she was 41 years old.         She died of cancer, her friends said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Samuel came to the city schools in 1983 with several years of experience in children's educational programs at New York University and the Community Service Society. The mentoring program became the first citywide initiative of its kind, matching adult volunteers with children in need of role models and guidance.         As its director, she shaped the program to train, monitor and evaluate such mentors, and its comprehensive approach came to be a national prototype. Ms. Samuel's work also came to the attention of Matilda Cuomo, the Governor's wife, and became a pilot for the New York State Mentoring Program.         In 1986, Ms. Samuel became director of the Office of School and Business Linkages to develop initiatives that involve people from the private sector and government with students, teachers and administrators.         Ms. Samuel, who graduated from Rider College and attended Montclair State College, left her post last year to seek a Ph.D. at Harvard University in the urban superintendents program. She attended the university until overcome by illness earlier this winter.         Ms. Samuel is survived by two teen-age sons, Obataiye and Oshunbunmi Samuel of Manhattan. She is also survived by her mother, Lillian B. Fraser of the Bronx, and her brother, Earl W. Fraser Jr. of Manhattan.       
         Paula Ruth Oboler Schwartz, a psychotherapist, social worker and civil rights advocate, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. Her family would not give her age.         She died of cancer, her family said.         In the 1960's she was a caseworker for the Suffolk County Social Services Department, worked for the National Council on Aging and was the community relations director for the Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality.         In the 1970's she was the social-services coordinator for the Community Affairs Department in Islip, L.I., for two years and taught at Adelphi's School of Social Work for six years. Her psychotherapy practice began in 1975 and continued until her death.         Over the years she also worked as a consultant for the American Foundation for the Blind and Mount Sinai Medical Center. She also organized conferences on bereavement for Yeshiva University.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Queens. After graduating from the University of New Mexico, she earned a master's degree in social work at Adelphi University.         Her husband, Gerald Schwartz, a chemist and industrial hygienist, is dead. Her companion for the last several years was Paul Secchia.         Surviving are two sons, Steven, of Huntington Station, L.I., and Roy, of Kentfield, Calif., and one grandchild.       
         Linda M. Arenth, a nursing executive and innovator in the care of cancer patients, died Feb. 9 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was 59 years old and lived in Baltimore.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Arenth was the vice president of nursing and patient services at Hopkins. Earlier, she was the first director of nursing at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, where she developed the system now used nationally to designate nursing services for different types of cancer patients. She was the first recipient of the national Oncology Nursing Society's award for excellence in the administration of cancer nursing.         She was also on the boards of the Foundation for Nursing of Maryland and Health Care for the Homeless.         Born in Orange, Calif., she grew up in nearby Bellflower. She graduated from Cottey College in Nevada, Mo., in 1952 and earned a nursing degree from the University of Southern California in 1955 and a master's degree from the University of Maryland in 1974. She was a doctoral candidate at Columbia University.         She was divorced from Donald Arenth, a designer who died last year.         She is survived by two sons, Craig of Albuquerque, N.M., and Sean of Frostburg, Md.; two sisters, Janet Morgan of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Maureen Morgan of Ossining, N.Y.; two brothers, Peter Magnusson of Spokane, Wash., and Dennis Magnusson of Boston, Mass.       
         Jean R. Yawkey, the majority owner of the Red Sox, a fixture at Fenway Park for almost half a century and a major Boston philanthropist, died yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, six days after suffering a severe stoke. She was 83 years old.         Despite reports that she had been in failing health last year, Mrs. Yawkey had continued to attend Red Sox home games.         In addition to her active role with the Red Sox and her extensive charitable work, Mrs. Yawkey had been a director of the National Baseball Museum and Hall of Fame since 1984, when she became the first, and so far only woman elected to the board.         As the widow of Thomas A. Yawkey, the multimillionaire sportsman who bought the Red Sox for $1 million in 1933 and lost an estimated $10 million trying to build championship teams over the next 44 seasons, Mrs. Yawkey saw it as her duty to live up to his free-spending ways after his death in 1976.         For a while, however, it appeared that the team would fall into other, less generous, hands. In 1978, the Yawkey estate was on the verge of selling the team to a syndicate formed by Haywood C. Sullivan, a Red Sox executive, and the team's former trainer, Edward G. (Buddy) LeRoux Jr., with Mrs. Yawkey as a limited partner.         But the deal was so heavily leveraged that it failed to win the approval of the baseball commissioner until Mrs. Yawkey, who put up the Fenway real estate as part of her stake, agreed to join the group as the third general partner. At the time of the transaction, the club was valued at $20 million.         The arrangement proved stormy almost from the start, with Mr. LeRoux pressing for measures that would earn profits for the partnership and Mrs. Yawkey just as determined to continue operating the team in the grand Yawkey tradition. Mr. Sullivan for the most part sided with Mrs. Yawkey, and Mr. LeRoux was increasingly isolated.         By 1987, Mrs. Yawkey held a two-thirds interest to Mr. Sullivan's one-third share, and she was very much in charge from then on, relegating Mr. Sullivan to little more than a figurehead. Denied the Ultimate Goal         Although Mrs. Yawkey's business adviser and presumptive heir, John Harrington, the president of the JRY Corporation, which holds the Yawkey Red Sox shares, was often mistaken for the real power behind the franchise, those close to the club insisted that Mr. Harrington was merely the prime minister and Mrs. Yawkey was always the queen.         Like her husband, who saw his team win three pennants but never a World Series championship, Mrs. Yawkey, too, was denied the ultimate goal. During her tenure, the Red Sox won the American League East three times, but in their only World Series appearance, lost to the Mets in 1986.         Mrs. Yawkey, whose original name was Jean Remington Hollander, was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 24, 1909, and raised in Freeport, L.I.         Her first marriage apparently ended in a divorce within a short time, and from the early 1930's until the 1940's, Jean R. Hiller, as she was known, worked as a model at Jay Thorpe, a fashionable women's store on West 57th Street in Manhattan.         It was there that she supposedly met Mr. Yawkey during a visit to the store with his first wife, Elise Sparrow Yawkey. The couple, who had married in 1925, six years after Mr. Yawkey had inherited $20 million at the age of 16, divorced in November 1944, and Mr. Yawkey remarried the next month. Followed Games Closely         At Fenway, Jean and Tom Yawkey maintained his and her rooftop boxes. He liked to sit and drink with his cronies and cuss, it was once explained, while the more dignified Mrs. Yawkey sat with their wives or close friends.         Her attendance at Red Sox games was more than duty. She meticulously kept score in a custom-bound set of score cards.         Mrs. Yawkey rarely missed the annual visit to Cooperstown, N.Y., for Hall of Fame inductions. She became a major benefactor of the museum, donating two wings to the building and commissioning the famous basswood statue of Williams at work by Armand LaMontagne.         She apparently has no immediate survivors.       
         Mary Childs Black, an art historian, folk art expert, former museum director and writer, died yesterday at her home in Germantown, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said M. J. Gladstone, a friend.         Mrs. Black's greatest contribution to American folk art scholarship was her identification of the unsigned paintings of known American 18th- and 19th-century artists, attributions she based largely on social history.         Mrs. Black organized more than 100 exhibitions seen in the United States, Britain or Israel. She made her most important discovery in the late 1960's, when she identified portraits attributed to four unidentified painters as the work of one man, Ammi Phillips, an itinerant 19th-century artist born in Connecticut. She disclosed her findings in 1969 in the book "Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter, 1788-1865," which she wrote with Barbara and Lawrence Holdridge, folk art collectors. The biography was published when she was director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, where she had organized the first major show of Phillips's work. A Start at Williamsburg         Her museum career began in 1956 when she was hired as a research assistant at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Two years later she became curator at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center at Williamsburg, and was named director in 1961.         She left Williamsburg in 1964 to become the director of the Museum of American Folk Art. In 1969 she moved to the New-York Historical Society, where she remained as the curator of sculpture, painting and decorative arts until 1982, when she was abruptly dismissed by the director, Dr. James B. Bell.         Mrs. Black protested the dismissal and was widely supported in the museum world. After a complaint was filed with Federal and state agencies contending that the society had violated sex- and age-discrimination laws, the society settled out of court, awarding Mrs. Black a sum equal to the back pay and vacation owed to her, and restoring her full pension. Dr. Bell resigned in 1988.         At her death, Mrs. Black was working on an exhibition of Colonial American painters to be presented at the New-York Historical Society, said Barbara Knowles Debs, the director and president. A Childhood Interest         Mrs. Black often said her interest in folk art stemmed from seeing Erastus Salisbury Field's 19th-century portraits of her ancestors in her grandparents' home when she was a child in Pittsfield, Mass., where she was born.         Mrs. Black graduated from the Women's College of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1943, did graduate work at Catholic University in Washington and earned a master's degree in art history at George Washington University in 1952.         Her books include "Old New York in Early Photographs" (1973), "What Is American in American Art" (1971), "Erastus Salisbury Field" (1984) and "Gracie Mansion: A History of the New York Mayor's House" (1984). She was the co-author with Jean Lipman of "American Folk Painting" (1967).         She is survived by a daughter, Merrill Black of New Durham, N.H., and a grandson.       
         Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn, a leading fashion model in the 1940's and 50's, died Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Huntington L.I.         She died of pneumonia, a family representative said.         An elegant blonde, the Swedish-born model posed for some of the most famous photographers of the age, including Horst P. Horst, George Hoyningen Huene and Irving Penn, whom she married in 1950. In the late 1940's, when most models were paid $10 to $25 an hour, she was earning $40 an hour. When most models's careers ended before their 30th birthdays, hers flourished until she was past 40.         She was a frequent subject of Penn's photographs for Vogue magazine, particularly his studies of French haute couture. Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of Conde Nast Publications, which publishes Vogue, said the Penns represented "an extraordinary relationship between a photographer and a model."         "She was the inspiration and subject of some of Penn's greatest photographs," Mr. Liberman said yesterday. "She epitomized a very noble period of fashion and couture. She gave a classical dignity to anything she wore." 'A Good Clothes Hanger'         Lisa Fonssagrives had a more down-to-earth attitude to her contributions as a model. She was quoted in a 1949 article in Time magazine as saying: "It is always the dress, it is never, never the girl. I'm just a good clothes hanger."         In addition to modeling, she also pursued careers as a ballet dancer, a photographer, a fashion designer and a sculptor.         She was born in Uddevalla, Sweden. Her father, a dentist who also painted, changed the family name from Anderson, which he considered too commonplace, to Bernstone. Her mother made clothes and encouraged Lisa to study art and ballet.         Lisa Bernstone went to Paris to pursue a dancing career. She met and married Fernand Fonssagrives, a dancer, there in 1935. Photographs Led to Modeling         A year later, Horst took some photographs of her that led to a modeling career. Pictures of her appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1939, she worked both as a model and as a photographer.         She continued both careers after her divorce and subsequent marriage to Penn. After she stopped modeling in the mid-50's, she designed clothes for about six years, at one point doing a collection of leisure wear for Lord & Taylor.         In the 1960's, she devoted her time to sculpturing, working in marble, bronze and fiberglass. She was represented by the Marlborough Gallery.         A book on her work as a model is scheduled for publication later this year in Germany.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer, and a son, Tom Penn, a metal designer, both of New York City; by two sisters, Lilian Bernstone and Kajsa Lundquist, both of Sweden, and by two grandchildren.       
         Emilia Sherman Maurer, who put the Rockettes through their paces from the gala opening of Radio City Music Hall on Dec. 27, 1932, until she retired as director of the dancers more than 40 years later, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhassett, L.I. She lived in Point Lookout, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Miss Sherman, who used her maiden name professionally, had kept her age a secret and left "explicit instructions" that it remain so, her son said. She died after a long illness, he said.         A close associate of Russell E. Markert, who founded the Rockettes in 1926, Miss Sherman choreographed many of the young dancers' routines. These included signature tap routines as well as her specialty, dance presentations she developed from the folk dances of many nations.         When Mr. Markert moved his troupe to Rockefeller Center in 1932, Miss Sherman became its captain as well as a dancer in the chorus line. She drilled the other dancers, showed them their steps and movements and kept them in line.         She quickly became a principal aide to Mr. Markert and, for more than 15 years, was his associate director. She became director upon his retirement in 1971. She retired in 1973.         Miss Sherman, a native of New York City, attended Professional Children's School here and later studied ballet and flamenco dancing. She made her vaudeville debut at the age of 6 and first went on a Broadway stage when she was 12 years old.         She learned her first tap steps from another dancer in Shubert Alley minutes before an audition, winning a job as a specialty act. From then on, she was known for her ability to pick up steps quickly and create new ones on her own.         This led her to choreography as a career. At Radio City, this entailed conjuring up a new spectacle with every change in the movie program, about once a month. Miss Sherman also played den mother and sergeant major to the 46 precision dancers in the troupe, any 36 of whom kicked off four times daily in a wheeling straight line nearly a city block long. In addition, she rehearsed the dancers four hours a week.         Miss Sherman is survived by her husband of 56 years, Henry S. Maurer; their son, Henry S. Jr., of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a daughter, Arnelle Liblit of Commack, L.I., and one grandson.       
         Lettie Gay Carson, who fought to save railroad service both in New York and Pennsylvania, died on Wednesday at her home in Newtown, Pa. She was 91 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, her daughter, Sally Carson, said.         Mrs. Carson, who was born in Pike County, Ill., and graduated from the University of Illinois, came to New York in the early 1920's. From 1927 until 1933, she was director of the Home Institute of The New York Herald Tribune.         In 1924, she married Gerald H. Carson, an advertising executive, who later wrote several books as a social historian, including "Cornflake Crusade."         When the Carsons moved to a retirement home in Newtown, Pa., Mrs. Carson organized a group to preserve rail service in and around Philadelphia. Her husband died in 1990.         Surviving in addition to her daughter are three grandchildren.       
         Anita Colby, perhaps the nation's first "supermodel" and known as "The Face" after her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, died yesterday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 77 years old.         Miss Colby died of lung disease, her sister, Francine Okie of East Greenwich, R.I., said.         Although her career was launched and revolved around her widely acclaimed beauty, Miss Colby became an author, a newspaper columnist, an advertising executive, chief assistant to Hollywood moguls and a host on the "Today" show -- as well as a model and film actress.         Born Anita Counihan in Washington, on Aug. 5, 1914, Miss Colby was the eldest daughter of Bud Counihan, a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. A Stunning $100 an Hour         At the age of 19, Ms. Colby moved to New York and soon became the nation's most famous and highest-paid model, working for the John Powers agency. With her willowy, ash-blonde beauty, she was the first model ever to receive $100 an hour -- a stunning figure in those days -- and she once appeared on the covers of 15 magazines in a single month, including Time.         "She was the first great model," Miss Colby's longtime friend, Frances Koltun, said yesterday. "She was an extraordinarly stylish woman, and I hate to use that word because it sounds superficial, but she had exquisite taste."         Realizing that she had chosen a short-lived career, Miss Colby moved to Hollywood after only one year as a model and, while on contract with R.K.O., appeared in nine movies, including "Mary Queen of Scots" and "Brute Force." A New Career         But her reviews were hardly raves, and Miss Colby returned to New York in the early 1940's to take a position selling advertising for Harper's Bazaar. A column about her in The Herald Tribune on Jan. 4, 1950, written by Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg, said, "Her contract called for a salary of $55 a week, plus -- and that proved to be a big plus -- 10 percent of all the advertising she brought into the magazine." Miss Colby's sister, Francine, said yesterday, "She sold more advertising than all of them."         To her friends, according to the Herald Tribune column, she said: " 'If I ever go to Hollywood again, I'll tell those stars what to do.' And she did."         In 1944, Miss Colby was hired by David O. Selznick as his studio's "feminine director." Ms. Falkenburg, who became a close friend of Miss Colby, said yesterday: "She was in charge of coordinating all of these stars of the Selznick stable, on screen and off. She decided how they should be photographed, how they would dress, how public they should become, what interviews they should do. She was the den mother for the top beauties in America." Turned Down Clark Gable         And in the process, Miss Colby became friends with Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and others. She also turned down marriage proposals from Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, but let them down easy. "I introduced them to their wives," she told a reporter in 1970 on the occasion of her first and only marriage, to Palen Flagler, a business executive. Mr. Flagler died in 1980.         In 1947, after working for the Selznick organization, Miss Colby served as a $150,000-a-year executive assistant to the head of Paramount Pictures. She later started a public relations company in New York, wrote "Anita Colby's Beauty Book," bought and sold the Women's News Service, for which she wrote a syndicated newspaper column called "Anita Says," and appeared for six months on the "Today" show with Dave Garroway. There he hired Barbara Walters to write her scripts.         Miss Colby is survived by her sister.       
         Inez Camprubi Mabon, a former publisher of the La Prensa Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, died on Friday at her home in Southbury, Conn. She was 80 years old and also lived in Greenwich, Conn.         She died of cancer, a relative said.         Mrs. Mabon ran La Prensa from 1950 to 1963, when it was sold and merged with El Diario. Her father, Jose Camprubi, founded the publication as a general interest daily paper in 1913, and she took over after he died. It circulated nationally and claimed to be the oldest Spanish-language newspaper in the continental United States.         Mrs. Mabon was born in New York City. She studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan and continued portrait and landscape painting as a hobby the rest of her life.         Her husband was John Scott Mabon, a publishing executive who was the acting director of University of Michigan Press. He is deceased.         She is survived by a son, Ferdy C. of Greenwich, and a sister, Leontine Tintner of Vienna, Austria.       
         Margaret T. Barker, an actress and director who was an original member of the Group Theater, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 83 years old and had homes in New York City and Fairfield, Conn.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         Miss Barker was born in Baltimore, where her father was a prominent doctor. She attended Bryn Mawr College, where a fellow actor in student productions was Katharine Hepburn, and began her career in 1928 as the flirtatious Alice Fordyce in the Broadway production of "The Age of Innocence," which starred Katharine Cornell. Three years later, she appeared as Henrietta in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" with Miss Cornell. She left that production to join the Group Theater, taking major roles in "The House of Connelly," "Men in White" and Clifford Odets's "Till the Day I Die." In 1937, when the Group Theater split into warring factions, she was dismissed.         In addition to many Broadway appearances in the 1940's and 50's, including roles in the original productions of Lillian Hellman's "Autumn Garden" and Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding," she performed with the Williamstown Summer Theater in Massachusetts for 10 years and was a member of the Circle Repertory Company in New York. She also directed, produced and performed in Off Broadway plays, regional theaters, television and film.         Her companion was Ann Macfarlane.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Later, she taught social work at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and maintained an active practice in cognitive therapy.         She is survived by her husband, Gabriel; a son, Jeffrey, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Jan Doughery of Sedona, Ariz; a brother, Martin Whitman of New York City; a sister, Judge Phyllis Beck of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.       
         Louise Leonard Wright, who was active for many years in women's and foreign affairs, died on April 17 at Crosslands, a retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 95 years old and had previously lived in Charlottesville, Va., and, until 1956, in Chicago.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         A native of Wilmette, Ill., she graduated from the University of Minnesota, which cited her for its Outstanding Achievement Award 50 years after she received a master's degree there.         The National League of Women Voters also honored Mrs. Wright for 50 years of service. She was a member of the league's national board in the 1930's and headed its government and foreign affairs department when the United States entered World War II. In testimony before the Senate on the country's neutral status in 1939, she also spoke for the American Association of University Women, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the National Board of the Young Women's Christian Association, the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Women's Trade Union League.         Mrs. Wright was a past executive director of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations and in the 1950's directed the Midwest office of the Institute for International Education. She was a former president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and was active in the Institute of Pacific Relations.         Mrs. Wright is survived by her daughter, Rosalind Wright Harris of New York City; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.         She was also an officer of the Young Men's Christian Association, Brooklyn chapter manager for the American Red Cross and a member of the boards of the Irvington House for Children, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society and the Willoughby House Settlement.         Born in Waco, Tex., she graduated from the University of Texas in 1926 and Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1930.         Her husband of 35 years, E. J. Audi, who ran a furniture and carpet business, died in 1968.         She is survived by two sons, Alfred, of Syracuse, and Robert, of Lincoln, Neb.; a daughter, Elaine Audi Macken of Brooklyn; a sister, Aline Nemir Speer of Austin, Tex., and eight grandchildren.       
         Melissa Stutsman Topping, an executive of the Henry Luce Foundation, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of complications from cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Topping was the vice president and secretary of the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan and principal staff officer of its Clare Boothe Luce Fund. She administered $21 million in grants for scholarships, fellowships and professorships for women in science, to help remedy their under-representation in that field.         She was born in St. Louis and graduated from Vassar College in 1964. After working for a law firm and Citibank, she joined the foundation in 1969, where she progressed from research assistant to program associate, program officer, associate director and vice president.         Mrs. Topping was also a trustee of Pratt Institute, manager of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York, an advisory council member of the New York Women's Foundation and a past board member of the Women's Prison Association and was also active in the Trust for Cultural Resources.         Surviving are her husband of 14 years, Henry J. Topping Jr., a private investor; her mother, Helen Eades Stutsman of St. Louis; a sister, Nancy Lamb of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Albert C. Stutsman Jr. of St. Louis; and two stepchildren, Henry J. 4th, and Samantha S. Topping, both of Manhattan.       
         Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.         She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said.         Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.         She started as a financial aide in the Ossining urban renewal agency, then worked for the New York City Office of Management and Budget. She became director of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program in Fairfield County, Conn., then was appointed the Private Industry Council's deputy director for southern Connecticut. She joined the Yonkers control board as deputy director.         Mrs. Brewster helped found Job's Refuge, a homeless shelter in Ossining.  She served on the board of the Open Door Family Health Clinic in Ossining, was a deacon for Briarcliff Congregational Church and was president of the Inter-Faith Council for Action, a housing preservation organization.         Surviving are her husband of eight years; their daughter, Catherine Eisenmann; her mother, Barbara Brewster of Ossining; and three sisters, Deborah Ferrenz of Silver Spring, Md., Abigail McGahey of Tyngsboro, Mass., and Alison Henderson of North Andover, Mass.       
         Madeleine Feldman Gutman, who promoted free music, art and other cultural events in Greenburgh, N.Y., died on May 10 at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers.         She was 68 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She died after an accident at home, her family said.         For 22 years Mrs. Gutman headed Greenburgh's Arts and Culture Committee, first as chairwoman and then as executive director. Financed by government, business and private donations, the committee presents concerts, exhibitions and lectures, drawing audiences from throughout Westchester County.         She emphasized cultural diversity that included Indian art, Sufi music, poetry competitions, chamber music, discussions on religion and Cambodian dance. She insisted on free admission and encouraged people to sample events and feel comfortable about leaving ones that did not appeal to them.         Mrs. Gutman was born in Manhattan. She privately studied piano, art and dance and graduated from New York University. Before running the cultural committee, she worked as an interior designer.         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Jeremiah, a lawyer in Manhattan; three daughters, Mara Ferris of Brookline, Mass., and Thea Gutman and Rebecca Menon, both of Manhattan; a sister, Naomi Fatouros of Bloomington, Ind., and two grandchildren.       
         Jean Tilford Palmer, a former director of the Navy Waves and longtime administrator at Barnard College, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         During World War II, Miss Palmer was a Wave captain, serving as women's reserve assistant to the Navy's director of enlisted personnel. She rose to the position of director of the Waves in 1945.         Upon leaving the Navy, Miss Palmer joined the staff of Barnard as director of admissions in 1946. Three years later, she was appointed general secretary, in charge of the college's development plan.         Remaining in this position for 23 years, Miss Palmer supervised all of the college's non-academic operations from admissions to fund-raising to the design of student dormitories.         Born in Omaha, Miss Palmer was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Before enlisting in the Naval Reserve in 1942, she served as business manager of the Association of the Junior Leagues of America for 14 years.         For her wartime service, she was awarded a Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy in 1944 and the Legion of Merit in 1946.         She is survived by a brother, Morse Palmer of Delray Beach, Fla.       
         Marjorie Severyns Ravenholt, an expert on Asia for government, news and non-profit organizations, died on Monday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 71 years old.         She died of complications after surgery for lung cancer, said her husband, Albert. The couple lived in Seattle and in Manila.         Mrs. Ravenholt's Asian ties began when she was an exchange student in Japan, Korea and Manchuria. In World War II, she served in India and China as an intelligence agent for the United States Office of Strategic Services, then became a correspondent in China for Life magazine.         She served as an analyst for a United States economic mission to China and later was director of education and information for the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which modernized much of Taiwan. Public Service Awards         For 30 years, Mrs. Ravenholt also helped run the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, financed by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, to honor Asians for public service and other achievement.         She was born in Sunnyside, Wash., graduated from the University of Washington and studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University. She worked briefly for the United States Board of Economic Warfare at the beginning of World War II.         She and her husband were among seven veteran journalists who returned to China in 1985 at the invitation of the Government.         Mr. Ravenholt is the only immediate survivor.       
         Theodora Wiesner, the former director of the American Dance Festival and of the dance division of Brooklyn College, died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 83 years old.         She died of cancer, said her brother, Alwin, of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.         Dr. Wiesner, who was born in Rice Lake, Wis., was a physical-education major at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when she discovered the university's dance program. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 1930, she did graduate work in dance and physical education at New York University.         Dr. Wiesner taught dance before World War II at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. She served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Women's Reserve during the war and was director of emplacement for the Waves in San Diego.         In 1949, she became an administrative assistant at the Connecticut College School of Dance in New London, which presented the American Dance Festival, this country's leading summer festival of modern dance.         Dr. Wiesner was also director of the dance program at Brooklyn College from 1950 to 1975, when she retired.         Her brother is her only survivor.       
         Marlene Dietrich, the magnetic movie star and singer who was an international symbol of glamour and sex for more than half a century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 90 years old.         In her films and record-breaking cabaret performances, Miss Dietrich artfully projected cool sophistication, self-mockery and infinite experience. Her sexuality was audacious, her wit was insolent and her manner was ageless. With a world-weary charm and a diaphanous gown showing off her celebrated legs, she was the quintessential cabaret entertainer of Weimar-era Germany.         The Dietrich image, personified by Lola-Lola, the seductive cabaret singer in top hat and silk stockings whom she portrayed in "The Blue Angel," was that of a liberated woman of the world who chose her men, earned her own living and viewed sex as a challenge. Audiences were captivated by this creature out of no one's experience but out of everyone's imagination. 'Most Vulnerable Fantasies'         Her manner, the critic Kenneth Tynan wrote, was that of "a serpentine lasso whereby her voice casually winds itself around our most vulnerable fantasies."         "She has sex but no positive gender," Tynan wrote. "Her masculinity appeals to women and her sexuality to men."         Her friend Maurice Chevalier said: "Dietrich is something that never existed before and may never exist again. That's a woman."         The Dietrich image was born in the Berlin of the 1920's, when she appeared in plays, cabaret, and film roles of varying importance (she was an extra in G. W. Pabst's 1925 "Joyless Street," which featured Greta Garbo). Her mentor, the American director Josef von Sternberg, made her an international star with "The Blue Angel," which was filmed in 1930 in both German and English. Although in the movie's offstage scenes her 5-foot-5-inch frame seemed a bit blowzy and her manner a bit too Teutonic, her portrayal of Lola-Lola, who degrades and destroys an infatuated elderly professor (Emil Jannings), won her a Hollywood contract. She shed 30 pounds, and in six more von Sternberg movies the director and his star molded the legend.         Her hair became a golden blond, makeup and lighting made her cheekbones and nose appear patrician, and her dreamy blue eyes were framed by thinly penciled, sweepingly arched brows.         Perhaps the best description of her face was provided by Erich Maria Remarque, her longtime friend, in his novel "Arch of Triumph":         "The cool, bright face that didn't ask for anything, that simply existed, waiting -- it was an empty face, he thought; a face that could change with any wind of expression. One could dream into it anything. It was like a beautiful empty house waiting for carpets and pictures. It had all possibilities -- it could become a palace or a brothel." A Lifelong Task Of Creating an Image         Working with von Sternberg, the actress became a thorough professional and perfectionist, expert in makeup, lighting, clothes and film editing. In later decades, she repeatedly had cosmetic surgery to keep her face taut, and adroitly had herself filmed with soft-focus, gauze-covered lenses.         "Glamour," she observed, "is assurance. It is a kind of knowing that you are all right in every way, mentally and physically and in appearance, and that, whatever the occasion or the situation, you are equal to it."         In clothes, she was a trend setter. Both on screen and off, she often wore trousers and mannish costumes. By proving that a woman could still look feminine in such clothes, she established "the Dietrich silhouette," emphasizing trimness and inconspicuous hips and bust.         The Dietrich-von Sternberg collaboration produced "Morocco" (1930), in which Miss Dietrich, again a cabaret singer, spurns and then pursues a French legionnaire (Gary Cooper) in the Sahara; "Dishonored" (1931), about a spy who betrays her country for love of a worthless man (Victor McLaglen), and "Shanghai Express" (1932), a melodrama in which she is a China Coast prostitute who offers herself to a warlord (Warner Oland) to save the life of a former lover (Clive Brook).         The last three Dietrich-von Sternberg films were "Blonde Venus" (1932), a mother-love soap opera; "The Scarlet Empress" (1934), an opulent and visually stunning melodrama about a lascivious Catherine the Great, and "The Devil Is a Woman" (1935), an erotic tale about a soldier-corrupting vamp in turn-of-the-century Seville.         Because it displayed her beauty most effectively, "The Devil Is a Woman" was her particular favorite. But it angered Spanish officials, at whose demand Paramount Pictures soon withdrew it and destroyed the master print. Miss Dietrich gave her own print of the film to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it is shown frequently.         The von Sternberg movies were increasingly self-indulgent, lyrical, exotic romances with pallid plots that trapped the actress in elaborate decor and special effects. They were losing a fortune, so Paramount's top executives, to protect their big investment in Miss Dietrich, barred von Sternberg from directing her again.         Seeking variety, she made her first comedy, "Desire," in 1936. It was a satire about an urbane jewel thief who steals a choice necklace from a Parisian jeweler and, in efforts to keep it, becomes involved with a hayseed Detroit engineer (Gary Cooper).         A second comedy, "Destry Rides Again," a 1939 spoof of the Old West, was even more successful. The actress, as a freewheeling saloon entertainer, seduces a valiant sheriff (James Stewart) and has a hair-pulling, face-pummeling brawl with a competitor (Una Merkel).         Miss Dietrich was a Berliner who was an early and passionate opponent of Nazism. When Hitler started arresting Jews, she financed the escape of several friends. Rejects Germany; Films Are Banned         In 1937, while filming the melodrama "Knight Without Armour" in England, she was approached by agents of Hitler offering her an almost blank check to return to Germany to star in movies of her choice. She angrily rejected the offer, and her films were banned in Germany. Soon after, she applied for American citizenship, which was granted in 1939.         During World War II, Miss Dietrich became somewhat of a symbol of free Germany. She made anti-Nazi broadcasts in German, took part in many war-bond drives and, in three years, entertained half a million Allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Western Europe.         Tirelessly and good-humoredly, she roughed it with the G.I.'s, standing patiently in food lines, washing with snow and sleeping in dugouts and ruins, often near the front lines. She sang her movie songs, the international wartime ballad "Lili Marlene" and some current songs, and even played a musical saw, a skill she had mastered for the Berlin stage. The troops loved her.         After the war, she was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the United States Government bestows. France named her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor and Belgium dubbed her a Knight of the Order of Leopold.         Her most noteworthy movie roles after the war were as an exotic gypsy in Mitchell Leisen's "Golden Earrings" (1947), with Ray Milland; a manipulative Berlin cabaret singer in Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair" (1948); a saloon manager hiding outlaws in Fritz Lang's "Rancho Notorious" (1952); a duplicitous wife in Mr. Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution" (1958); a cynical brothel-keeper in Orson Welles's "Touch of Evil" (1958) and an aristocratic widow in Stanley Kramer's "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961).         "Touch of Evil" provided Miss Dietrich with one of her most memorable lines. She admonished the character played by the corpulent Welles to "lay off the candy bars."         Her last film was a small part in the forgettable 1979 melodrama called "Just a Gigolo." In 1986, Maximilian Schell made a documentary about her, entitled "Marlene"; she did not appear on screen because of vanity, but she was interviewed and her voice is heard almost continuously.         Miss Dietrich began her cabaret performances in 1954, and for more than two decades, for fees up to $30,000 a week, she hypnotized audiences in such disparate cities as London, Las Vegas, Paris, New York, Montreal, Johannesburg and Tokyo and Tel Aviv (where she sang in German with some apprehension, but with stunning success). Her manner matched her movie image: at once intimate and elusive.         In 1960, also with trepidation about wartime animosities, she sang in Berlin. There were a few hecklers, but the vast majority of Berliners welcomed her home.         To keep her shows up to date, she interspersed the nostalgia with new songs, and in 1963 she performed in London with -- or perhaps against -- the youthful Beatles.         Marie Magdalene Dietrich was born in Berlin on Dec. 27, 1901. Her father, Louis Erich Otto Dietrich, who was a police lieutenant and a former cavalry major, died when she was 9 years old.         Her mother was Wilhelmina Elisabeth Josephine Felsing, the daughter of a well-to-do watch merchant, who soon after being widowed, married Edouard von Losch, a cavalry lieutenant. He was killed on the Russian front in 1918.         The young Marie Magdalene and her elder sister, Elisabeth, were brought up strictly in an upper-middle-class Prussian home. Marie Magdalene attended a private school in Weimar, studied French and took violin lessons, hoping for a concert career. But when she was 18, a hand injury threatened that dream and she decided to try dramatics, contracting her two given names to Marlene because her family disapproved of acting.         She failed an audition with Max Reinhardt and joined the chorus of a touring musical revue. A year later, she passed a second audition and was admitted to Reinhardt's drama school.         Soon after, she won small roles on the stage and in German films. Her only substantial role was in the film "Tragedy of Love" (1923). She was assigned the part by Rudolph Sieber, a young Czechoslovak production assistant. They were married on May 17, 1924, and the next year had a daughter, Maria.         After the early years of their marriage, Mr. Sieber was rarely seen with his wife. He held movie jobs in New York and Hollywood and, in 1953, became a chicken farmer in California in the San Fernando Valley. They never divorced, but lived apart for most of their remaining years. He died in 1975.         In the late 1920's, Miss Dietrich won increasingly important leading roles on the German stage and was likened in the German press to Greta Garbo. A Director's Search For a Cruel Temptress         In early 1930, von Sternberg arrived in Berlin to make "The Blue Angel," based on the Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrat." The director had been searching for an actress who could exude the electric eroticism of the movie's cruel temptress. He saw Miss Dietrich in a play and knew his search was over.         Two decades later, the actress was referred to by the press as "the world's most glamorous grandmother." Her daughter, also an actress, married William Riva, a scenic artist, in 1947, and had four sons. Miss Dietrich was often seen with her grandsons in Manhattan, wheeling their carriages in Central Park, later seeing them off to camp at Grand Central Terminal and even carrying their laundry.         She was deeply devoted to her family, worked hard to advance her daughter's career and helping her daughter and son-in-law financially. To be with her family, Miss Dietrich lived in Manhattan when not touring, but in 1972 she moved her chief residence from Park Avenue to Paris, where she lived in a four-room apartment on Avenue Montaigne, in the Eighth Arrondissement.         She was a close friend of many famous people, including Ernest Hemingway and Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. She also had widely reported love affairs with the writer Erich Maria Remarque and the actors Jean Gabin, Michael Wilding and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. "I've always been attracted to intelligent men," she once said. "I can pick 'em in a full room, just like that. I don't care what age they are."         Miss Dietrich kept in touch with friends around the world by telephone and letter. She often cooked delicacies for friends, as well as for stagehands and doormen. Her specialties included goulash and apple strudel. She was also knowledgeable about antiques, and owned paintings by Delacroix, Cezanne, Utrillo and Corot. A Faith in Astrology, For Herself and Others         Deeply influenced by astrology, she regularly had horoscopes prepared for friends. On that subject, she once remarked: "Astrology! Of course. After all, everyone knows that the moon pulls the sea away from the land, and farmers don't plant when the moon is wrong.         "Why should humans escape?"         She granted occasional interviews to friendly journalists, but over the years she grew impatient with those who asked questions she regarded as stupid or pointless.         In her memoirs, "Marlene Dietrich's ABC," published in 1962, she wrote: "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast."         Miss Dietrich, who stopped performing in the mid-1970's, lived the last years of her life as a virtual recluse in her Paris apartment.         A photograph of her in "Shanghai Express" was chosen to publicize this year's Cannes International Film Festival, which starts Thursday. The poster adorns billboards all over France.       
         Theodora K. Sklover, a former director of the Governor's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development who worked to broaden public access to film and television, died May 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 53 years old.         Ms. Sklover died as a result of jumping out of her apartment window, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said, in what the Medical Examiner ruled yesterday as a suicide.         Ms. Sklover developed an interest in media from studying dance and drama at Bennington College and using television as a teaching tool for preschoolers at the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan.         Her interest led to efforts to use television teaching on a wider scale and ultimately led her in the late 1960's to organize Open Channel, a nonprofit organization that lobbied for community access to cable systems and public programming. Ms. Sklover soon came to be recognized as an authority on public programming and was a consultant to several cities on how to set up public-access channels.         In 1979 Ms. Sklover created the state's office of film and television, the purpose of which was to entice filmmakers to include other sites in New York State besides New York City. She helped bring film and television productions worth more than $800 million to the state.         Ms. Sklover is survived by a sister, Marcia Kleinman, and a brother, Stanley Klein, both of New York City.       
         Marjorie Severyns Ravenholt, an expert on Asia for government, news and non-profit organizations, died on Monday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle. She was 71 years old.         She died of complications after surgery for lung cancer, said her husband, Albert. The couple lived in Seattle and in Manila.         Mrs. Ravenholt's Asian ties began when she was an exchange student in Japan, Korea and Manchuria. In World War II, she served in India and China as an intelligence agent for the United States Office of Strategic Services, then became a correspondent in China for Life magazine.         She served as an analyst for a United States economic mission to China and later was director of education and information for the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, which modernized much of Taiwan.         She was born in Sunnyside, Wash., graduated from the University of Washington and studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University. She worked briefly for the United States Board of Economic Warfare at the beginning of World War II.         She and her husband were among seven veteran journalists who returned to China in 1985 at the invitation of the Government.         Mr. Ravenholt is the only immediate survivor.       
         Jacqueline Smith, a television producer who led ABC Entertainment's daytime programming to six consecutive years of top ratings from 1978 through 1983, died on June 3 at her home. She was 59 years old and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Smith had also worked at CBS and NBC, where she oversaw daytime programming until last year. She was known in the industry for creating concepts in story development and production quality and for furthering the talents of actors and casting directors. Awards for Children's Programming         Ms. Smith was a native of Philadelphia, and attended Antioch College before starting her broadcasting career as a writer and producer at KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco. She received three Peabody Awards for children's programming there.         In 1963, the CBS network put her in charge of all its children's programming. She later became the director of special programs for the network in Hollywood, overseeing variety specials, award shows and dramatic specials.         Ms. Smith joined ABC in 1977 and, as a vice president, was responsible for the production, writing and performances on its daytime serials "All My Children," "Ryan's Hope," "One Life to Live" and "General Hospital." She enlisted guest appearances by many celebrities, Elizabeth Taylor among them, and wove aspects of adventure, fantasy, comedy and science-fiction into the accustomed fare of romance and family crises.         She stepped down in 1987, remained as a consultant for another year, and then formed her own company, Pygmalion Productions. She returned to the network wars to take charge of daytime programming for NBC Entertainment for two years until 1991.         Ms. Smith's companion was Ed Fisher, the cartoonist.         She is survived by her mother, Gertrude Feldenkreis of Atlantic City; a daughter, Eleanor Smith, and a son, David A., both of Santa Monica; a sister, Nancy Wurman of Philadelphia, and a brother, Howard Feldenkreis of Leominster, Mass.       
         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board. She was also the first woman to become the local and national president of Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America and the first to serve as a trustee of New York University Medical Center. 'Born Into a Good Life'         Born in Englewood, N.J., Mrs. Black grew up in in Ridgewood, N.J. While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. June Louin-Tapp, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development, died last Thursday in Osnabruck, Germany, while there for a two-month stay as a visiting professor at the University of Osnabruck. Dr. Louin-Tapp, a resident of Minneapolis, was 62 years old.         She died suddenly after a brief illness, said Richard Weinberg, director of the institute.         She taught and did research at the University of Chicago from 1964 to 1972, when she joined the Minnesota faculty. Her principal work concerned children's and adults' understanding of rules and laws.         She is survived by two daughters, Mara Tapp of Chicago and Kami Olsson-Tapp of San Diego, and four grandchildren.       
         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Sister Margaret Carthy, former president of the College of New Rochelle and dean of its graduate school, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She was known as Mother Mary Peter during her long career as a Roman Catholic college administrator.         She had Alzheimer's disease and died of pneumonia, said Sister Eileen Fane, prioress of the Convent of St. Teresa, an Ursuline community in New Rochelle.         Sister Margaret was born and raised in Manhattan and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1933. She worked for several years in the business office at Teachers College at Columbia University but, after taking her vows in the Order of St. Ursuline in 1939, she returned to New Rochelle to teach at the Ursuline School. A Former Dean         Sister Margaret began her years in the administration at the College of New Rochelle as assistant registrar in 1941 and served as dean of the college from 1950 to 1957 and then as president until 1961. She earned a master's and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in American church history at Catholic University in Washington.         She added a master's degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and worked for four years as staff editor of The New Catholic Encyclopedia while also lecturing at Catholic University. She then taught at the University of Maryland, becoming assistant director of the general ecducation program and then assistant dean of graduate studies.         In 1975, she returned to her alma mater to accept the post of dean of the graduate school, which she held until her retirement in 1979.         Both before and after her retirement, Sister Margaret wrote articles and books about American church history, including "Catholicism in English-Speaking Lands" (Hawthorn Books, 1964). Much of her writing focused on the Archdiocese of New York, including "A Cathedral of Suitable Magnificence" (St. Patrick's, 1984). In addition, she served as archivist for the Eastern Province of the Ursulines.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Connolly of Jericho, L.I., and many nieces and nephews.       
         Carole Mills Weinberg, a modeling agent and executive, died on Thursday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 49 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.         She was in Little Rock for treatment for cancer at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Center, her husband said.         Mrs. Weinberg was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to the United States with her family. After attending Northwestern University, she began modeling in Chicago and then taught modeling there.         Moving to New York City in the 1960's, she worked as an agent for the Sanford Leigh modeling agency, then became director of the television division of the Ford modeling agency and later director of the casting department at the Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn advertising company. She specialized in television commercials.         She and her husband, William P. Weinberg, became half-owners of Wilhelmina International Limited, the parent company of the Wilhelmina Artists and Wilhelmina Models. He was president of the Wilhelmina organizations, and she was on the board of directors. They sold their share in the company two years ago but remained as consultants for special projects.         Her survivors include her husband and her parents, Adam and Greta Boyce of Mount Prospect, Ill.       
         Debora Dammann Kramer, an administrator of mental health and social-welfare programs, died on Saturday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Mrs. Kramer was 54 years old and lived in Washington and in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a member of the family said.         Mrs. Kramer, after graduating from Radcliffe College, began her career in health care in the 1960's at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in Washington. She later headed nonprofit organizations devoted to helping children. She was executive director of the American Association of Psychiatric Services for Children from 1972 to 1979, which was based in Washington but moved in 1988 to Rochester.         From 1985 to 1987, Mrs. Kramer was executive director of the Committee for Food and Shelter in Washington, an advocacy group for the homeless, and a forerunner of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.         She was divorced from John R. Kramer in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Philadelphia, and Daniel, of Manhattan; two sisters, Penelope Johnston of Riverside, Conn., and Pamela Adams of Lexington, Me., and a grandson.       
         Mabel Randall Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in the creation of its programs to help troubled children, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness, her family said.         Miss Thomas served as the first full-time executive director of the organization, from 1952 until her retirement about 25 years later. Big Sisters eventually merged with the Big Brothers organization.         During her tenure, Big Sisters built a staff of social workers, psychologists and other professionals and opened offices in courts across the city to help neglected, delinquent or otherwise troubled youngsters. The annual caseload jumped from a relative handful to thousands. Her efforts won awards from the City Bar Association in New York and Community Trust.         Miss Thomas was born in Montgomery, Ala. She graduated from the University of Alabama in 1939. During World War II she worked on the staff of the U.S.O. at Fort McClellan, Ala., and later for the Red Cross. She resumed her studies at Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree in social work in 1952.         She is survived by two brothers, William of Montgomery and Walton of Milwaukee, and three sisters, Jean Walker of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Anna Atherton and Ethel Golson, both of Montgomery.         Correction:  July 21, 1992, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Mabel R. Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in helping troubled children, referred incorrectly to the status of the organization. It is independent, and separate from Big Brothers.       
         Helen M. Serfling, an art director for national magazines, advertising agencies and department stores, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Milton Simpson, her companion.

Mathias of Wiesbaden, Germany; two daughters, Natalie Wolfe of Manhattan and Sasha Wolfe of Brooklyn; a brother, Rudy Zerabica, and a sister, Josephine Simmons, both of Trafford, Pa., and one granddaughter.       
         Helen M. Knubel, archivist of the Lutheran Church, died on Thursday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91 years old. She lived in New Rochelle, N.Y., until she recently entered the Wartburg Nursing Home, in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Miss Knubel died of respiratory failure, said her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel.         Miss Knubel was considered the foremost archivist of the history of the Lutheran Church in North America. She helped to gather and maintain records of the earliest settlements of Lutherans in the United States and Canada and organized the library and archives of the National Lutheran Council, which coordinated the service work of more than 30 Lutheran groups.         From 1954 to 1966 she was secretary of research and statistics of the National Lutheran Council. From 1967 to her retirement in 1971, she was associate director of the Office of Research, Statistics and Archives to the council's successor, the Lutheran Council in the U.S.A. She also founded and directed the Oral History of Cooperative Lutheranism in America.         Miss Knubel was born in New York City. Her father, Frederick H. Knubel, was president of the United Church in America, from its founding in 1918 to 1944. Her brother, Frederick R. Knubel, was president of the United Lutheran Synod of New York and New England from 1945 to 1957.         Miss Knubel's formal schooling was interrupted at age 15, when she was struck by polio, which forced her to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She studied at the New School for Social Research; the Biblical Seminary of New York, the predecessor to the New York Theological Seminary, and the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Among many honors, Miss Knubel was awarded the Distinguished Disciple Award of the Metropolitan New York Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.         In addition to her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel, of Manhattan, she is survived by a niece, Helen Perry, of Milford, N.J.       
         Ruth Batchelor, a songwriter and radio and television reporter, died on July 23 at South Miami Hospital in Florida. She was 58 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Peter Kory.         Ms. Batchelor began her career as a songwriter, writing songs for Elvis Presley. She also wrote several musicals, including a version of "Tom Jones" for CBS-TV. In 1971, she released an album of women's liberation songs called "Reviving a Dream" on Femme Records, a company she began.         Ms. Batchelor founded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association in 1975, and was its president and executive director for three years. She was an entertainment reporter for ABC Television's "Good Morning America" and a film critic for National Public Radio.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Douglas, of Covelo, Calif.; her parents, Lil and Albert Tarshis of Las Vegas, Nev.; a sister, Lolo Berkoff, and a brother, Stanley Gordon, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.       
         Katharine Bradley Lenhart, a volunteer active for decades in civic and social causes, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan and Waterford, Conn.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         Born in Nyack, N.Y., Mrs. Lenhart graduated from Vassar College and studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Bank Street College of Education. She worked as a decorator before becoming executive secretary of the Spence School.         Mrs. Lenhart had been active in charities that included the American Red Cross, Bellevue Hospital and the Child Care Volunteers of New York. She was a benefactor and past president of the former Masters Nursery.         Mrs. Lenhart was involved in rehabilitating deserted buildings and transforming vacant lots into pocket parks or gardens in the South Bronx, an experience she turned into a play, "The Greening of Rosita." She was a founding director of West Farms Land Trust in Waterford and sat on the boards of the Hudson River Conservation Society and the Tappan Zee Historical Society.         Mrs. Lenhart is survived by three sisters, Helen B. Buckland of Farmington, Conn., and Mary B. Blake and Elizabeth B. Brookfield, of Nyack, and a brother, Dr. E. Tremain Bradley of Norfolk, Conn.       
         Pola Nirenska, a noted teacher and choreographer who danced with Mary Wigman, died on Saturday after a fall from the balcony of her apartment in Bethesda, Md. She was 81 years old.         The death was ruled a suicide by the Montgomery County Medical Examiner.         Miss Nirenska was a major force in dance in Washington, as a teacher, as director of a company whose dancers included Liz Lerman and Sharon Wyrrick (later choreographers in their own right), and as a creator of impressively fashioned dances filled with often raw emotion. Her last piece, presented at Dance Place in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims she had known and was called "In Memory of Those I Loved . . . Who Are No More."  Little Early Training         "Her dances are strong and stark, like massive three-dimensional sculpture in volume and weight," George Jackson, a Washington-based dance critic, said after Miss Nirenska's death. "Her figures are larger than life, but with very distinct personalities."         Miss Nirenska, who was born in Warsaw, insisted on a dance career as a child. She had very little early training, but graduated with honors from a music and dance school in Dresden, Germany, run by Wigman, the influential German Expressionist choreographer. Miss Nirenska performed with Wigman's company during its 1932-33 tour of the United States and Germany. She then embarked on a career as a solo dancer, teacher and choreographer, working in Warsaw, Vienna and Italy. In 1934 the International Dance Congress in Vienna awarded Miss Nirenska a first prize for choreography and a second prize for performing.         At the start of World War II, Miss Nirenska, who was Jewish, immigrated to England, where she gave solo recitals, choreographed musicals and entertained the troops. She also worked there with the choreographers Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder and modeled for the sculptor Jacob Epstein.         Miss Nirenska left for the United States in 1949. She studied in New York with leading American modern-dance choreographers and teachers, among them Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon and Louis Horst. She moved to Washington in 1951 and established a career there as a teacher at local ballet and modern-dance schools and at her own studio, and as a highly regarded choreographer with a company of her own.         Her marriage to Count John Ledesma, an actor and military pilot, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Jan Karski.       
         Jean Baer Fensterheim, a writer of personal self-help books and magazine articles aimed especially at women, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Herbert Fensterheim.         A native of Chicago and a 1944 graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Baer scored her first success as an author in 1965 when Macmillan began "Follow Me!," a travel guide for single women looking for a husband abroad. At the time, she was single and the publicity director for Seventeen magazine. The book grew from her experiences during more than a dozen trips to Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.         This was followed in 1968 by "The Single Girl Goes to Town" (Macmillan). Months after its publication, she married Dr. Fensterheim, a clinical psychologist who also became her co-author. Together, they focused on psychological writings.         Their latest book was "Making Life Right When It Feels All Wrong" (Macmillan, 1988).         Outside the genre, Ms. Baer wrote "The Self-Chosen" (Arbor House, 1982), a book about what she called "the world of the Jewish elite" in the United States since World War II.         She was the secretary of the Overseas Press Club and served on its board of directors.         Ms. Baer is survived, in addition to Dr. Fensterheim, by a sister, Carol Norr of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, Robert Baer of Woodstock, N.Y.       
         Sister Josephine Morgan, whose work as director of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College helped raise the standards of sacred music, died on Friday at Kenwood Convent of the Sacred Heart in Albany. She was 83 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Sister Mary Lyman, the convent's pastoral care minister.         Sister Morgan, who was born in New York City, entered the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1923. A decade later, she began teaching music at Manhattanville College, in Purchase, N.Y.         During her tenure as director of the Pius X School from 1952 to 1969, she helped renew an interest in Gregorian chants and other forms of music used in the Roman Catholic liturgy. In 1961, Pope John XXIII cited the school for its role in improving the quality of liturgical music.         From 1971 until her retirement in 1977, she served as superior of the Kenwood Convent, where she continued to live.         She is survived by a brother, Arthur J. Morgan of Westhampton Beach, L.I.       
         Alice Bennett Dunnington, a Government intelligence official during World War II, died on Monday at Beaumont at Bryn Mawr, a retirement home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 87 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Rodger McKinney, director of the Chadwick Funeral Home in Ardmore, Pa.         During the war years Mrs. Dunnington, a 1925 graduate of Smith College, was a policy planner for the Office of Strategic Services, precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. As secretary to the service's policy planning committee, she reported to Col. Edward Buxton, Deputy Director of the O.S.S.         Mrs. Dunnington's husband, Walter, died in 1971. She is survived by three daughters, Michelle Osborn of Haverford, Pa., and Washington, Patricia Pynchon of New York and Alexandra Whalen Sears of Lima, Peru; a stepson, Walter G. Dunnington Jr. of New York and Gladstone, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Allen D. Ohstrom of The Plains, Va.; eight grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.         Correction:  July 10, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Alice Bennett Dunnington, a Government intelligence officer in World War II, identified a daughter incorrectly. She is Alexandra Whelen Sears of Lima, Peru.       
         Alberta Smith Jacoby, a film maker and lecturer on mental health, died on Wednesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jacoby, a specialist in mental-health education, had been a member of the faculty of Yale University for the last 25 years and remained a lecturer on public health at the time of her death. She taught and produced documentaries at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, a part of the Yale School of Medicine.         She was born in Worthington, Minn., was an alternate on the 1928 Olympic diving team and became a champion golfer. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota and received a master's degree in public health from Yale in 1967, the year she joined the faculty.         She began to show films on health during World War II as a program director for the Office of War Information, an information officer at the Public Health Service and, finally, chief of information for the National Institute of Mental Health.         She went into film making herself in 1949, when she and her director-husband, the late Irving A. Jacoby, formed the Mental Health Film Board. A production company, it made more than 100 documentaries, some of which won awards, on subjects such as psychiatric illnesses, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and hospice care.         At Yale, she taught a course entitled Health Communications. With her assistance, student crews made films about local health agencies to educate the public about what the agencies did.         Mr. Jacoby died in 1985. She is survived by six children, Clair Haycraft Johnson of Maui, Hawaii, Sara Haycraft Sparrow of North Branford, Conn., Peter Altman of Boston, Leslie Altman Rescoria of Havertown, Pa., Tamar Jacoby of Manhattan, and Oren Jacoby, also of Manhattan; three brothers, Paul Smith of St. David's Island, Bermuda, and Robert and Sidney Smith, both of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara Morgan, the photographer whose portraits of Martha Graham captured the essence of that choreographer's art, died on Monday night at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 92 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Morgan was best known for her photographs of American modern dancers, among them Graham, Jose Limon, Doris Humphrey, Pearl Primus, Charles Weidman, Erick Hawkins and Merce Cunningham. Her dance photographs were never intended for publicity or documentation. Instead, she said in a 1980 interview, they were metaphors, created to catch the symbolic image that epitomized the dance or dancer.         Like Graham, she believed that gestures could express profound emotional truths. Her photographs revealed, Graham wrote in 1980, "the inner landscape that is a dancer's world." Reluctant Beginnings         She said one of her earliest influences was her father's suggestion that his 5-year-old daughter "think of everything in the world as dancing atoms." But she came to photography reluctantly and then, accidentally, to dance.         Her husband, Willard D. Morgan, talked her into trying photography, although she resisted at first, calling it journalism rather than art. Mr. Morgan, whom she married in 1925 and who died in 1967, was a photojournalist who made the Leica camera popular. He was the first photography editor of Life magazine and the first director of the photography division at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.         In 1935, soon after Mrs. Morgan had begun to photograph, she saw Graham's "Primitive Mysteries" and was drawn to its treatment of ritual in the American Southwest. The two women began six years of intense collaboration on a book, "Martha Graham: 16 Dances in Photographs," which was a centerpiece of both careers and which is considered the quintessential statement on how to look at dance and record it. The two women remained lifelong friends.         After 1945, Mrs. Morgan concentrated on photographing children, trees and plants, and on designing photomontages and light drawings. Her correspondence with William Carlos Williams, Margaret Mead, Joseph Campbell and Edward Weston, an early photographic influence, is considered a rich historical resource.         Among Mrs. Morgan's other books are "Summer's Children," "Barbara Morgan" and "Barbara Morgan Photomontage," all published by Morgan & Morgan of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Her photographs were exhibited in solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution and other museums and galleries in the United States and Europe.         She is survived by her sons, Lloyd, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Douglas, of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Julie Desloge Haggerty Hunnewell, a patron of the arts and civic figure on Long Island, died Aug. 19 at North Shore Community Hospital, in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 63 and lived in Glen Cove.         Mrs. Hunnewell died of cancer, said Tex McCrary, a family friend.         A native of St. Louis and a graduate of Manhattanville College, Mrs. Hunnewell was president of Corporate Art Inc., an art consulting firm, and had a long career as an expert in the interior design of corporate offices and hotels.         Mrs. Hunnewell was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and a trustee emeritus of the Berkshire School. She was also a founder and director of the Long Island Council on Alcoholism and founder of the Hazelden Fellowship Club of New York City. The club is affiliated with the Hazelden Institute of Minnesota, a leading rehabilitation center for people dependent on drugs and alcohol.         Mrs. Hunnewell is survived by her husband, Richard F. Hunnewell; six children, Joseph J. Haggerty, of Stowe, Vt., Louis D. Haggerty, of San Jose, Calif., Angela B. Haggerty, of Norwalk, Conn., Lucie B. Cook, of Plaistow, N.H., Bryan Haggerty, of Boston, and Leah Clark, of Waccabuc, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Virginia Sale, a character actress whose career in theater, film, radio and television spanned more than four decades, died on Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., where she lived. She was 93 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Miss Sale was best known for her work in Hollywood, where by her count she played more than 300 supporting roles in films, beginning with silent comedies in 1927 and concluding with "Slither" in 1970.         She also appeared for eight years in the radio serial "Those We Love," and she wrote and starred in "The Wrens' Nest," one of television's first family comedies, which was broadcast by ABC in 1949. She was frequently seen on the Garry Moore and Kate Smith shows and in other television comedies, including "Petticoat Junction" and "Green Acres."         Miss Sale also won acclaim for her one-woman show, "Americana Sketches," in which she drew upon her upbringing in Urbana, Ill., to explore the foibles and humor of small town-America.         Miss Sale attended the University of Illinois for two years and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her films included the 1930 "Moby Dick," with John Barrymore, and a string of Westerns, including "Badman's Territory" and "Trail Street," with Randolph Scott.         Miss Sale's husband, Sam Wren, an actor and director, died in Hollywood in 1962.         She is survived by a daughter, Virginia Wren Moore of Lake Forest, Ill., and a son, Christopher S. Wren of Manhattan, who is editor of new projects for The New York Times.       
         Karena P. Somerville, the manager of Consolidated Edison's Customer Outreach program, died on Thursday. She was 46 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         Mrs. Somerville died in an automobile accident on the Hutchinson River Parkway near the Orchard Beach exit in the Bronx. Her car struck a tree early Thursday morning in a construction area, the police said.         Mrs. Somerville, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Syracuse University. In 1973 she joined Con Edison's public-affairs department in Westchester. In 1987 she was named director of public affairs for Con Edison's Westchester customer service unit, and in 1990 she was named assistant to the chairman of Consolidated Edison.         Mrs. Somerville is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Kelley; a son, Chad; a twin sister, Tamara Westover, all of Rye, and her father, Paul Buiar of Pound Ridge, N.Y.       
         Antoinette M. Kraushaar, the owner of one of New York City's oldest art galleries, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes related to old age, said Carole Pesner, the director of Kraushaar Galleries Inc.         Miss Kraushaar was born in Manhattan on Dec. 25, 1902, into a family of art dealers, and she spent her life in the New York art world. While still a teen-ager, she went to work as a stenographer in the gallery that her uncle, Charles W. Kraushaar, founded in 1885 and that her father, John Kraushaar, inherited at his brother's death in 1917. Originally on Broadway at 33d Street, Kraushaar Galleries has moved five times in its 107-year history; since 1981, it has occupied a floor in 724 Fifth Avenue, a gallery building near 57th Street. Mrs. Pesner said yesterday that the gallery would continue to operate.         In its first years, the gallery concentrated on European artists, especially the Barbizon School of landscape painters. Under Miss Kraushaar's father, it became known for its close association with American artists. For many years it was the primary representative of the sculptor Gaston Lachaise, the painters Guy Pene du Bois and Charles Demuth, and several members of the group of American realists known as "the Eight," most notably George Luks, William Glackens, Maurice Prendergast and John Sloan.         In 1917, Luks painted a full-length portrait of Miss Kraushaar in a white graduation dress that has been widely reproduced and exhibited over the years. In the 1920's, Lachaise also sculptured a head of the dealer. Earlier this year, she gave the Luks portrait to the Brooklyn Museum, where it is on view in conjunction with the current exhibition "The Eight."         Miss Kraushaar took over the running of the gallery when her father became ill in the 1930's and became its owner at his death in 1946. She retired from its day-to-day management in 1988. Under her tenure the gallery continued to exhibit American realists. In the last decade, it has mounted large shows of Glackens and Sloan, and it continues to represent the Luks estate. But it also represents abstract artists, including William Kienbusch, Carl Morris and Sonia Gechtoff.         In 1961, Miss Kraushaar was among the handful of New York gallery owners who founded the Art Dealers Association of America; she served for many years on its board. In her later years, she was known for her receptiveness to younger art dealers and the work they exhibited.         She is survived by a nephew, Charles W. Kraushaar of Manhattan.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Harriet W. Sheridan, former undergraduate dean at Brown University, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 67 years old and lived in Barrington, R.I.         The cause of death was cancer, said Don DeMaio, a Brown spokesman.         Professor Sheridan was hired as dean at Brown in 1979 and remained in the post until 1987, when she resigned to return to her longtime career, the teaching of English. She later founded the Center for the Advancement of College Teaching at the university and was noted for her course on literature and medicine, which proved popular with many medical students.         She had arrived at Brown from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she had spent 26 years and had served at various times as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, chairwoman of the English department and faculty chairwoman. She was also Carleton's acting president from January to August of 1977, succeeding Howard Swearer, who had resigned to become president at Brown.         A native of Manhattan, she received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from Smith College in 1945 and a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1950.         Professor Sheridan was chairwoman of the American Association for Higher Education and a member of many educational groups, including the American Council on Education's Commission on Women in Higher Education. She was a former director of the Association of American Colleges and a former member of the Commission on Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.         She is survived by her husband, Philip; two daughters, Alison Buffum of Narrangansett, R.I., and Roo Sheridan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, the director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, died on Sept. 3 at the institute, where she lived. She was 63 years old.         She died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes, the institute said.         Sister Scaglione had worked as an educator since joining the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order, in 1947.         The order operates Grace Institute, which was founded by William Russell Grace and is now headed by his grandson, J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company.         The institute provides free occupational training, mostly for secretarial work, and other adult education, including nutrition, cooking and clothing classes, for women. It enrolls about 1,000 students a year.         As the director, Sister Scaglione helped adapt the institute's program to the changing needs of the city's minority and immigrant women. She introduced new courses, including English as second language, and added night sessions and classes in the Bronx.         Before working at Grace, Sister Joseph taught at St. Raymond's Academy and Spellman High School in the Bronx and was the director of St. Joseph's Academy in Greenwich Village.         A native of New Jersey, she grew up in Manhattan and Queens. After graduating from the College of Mount St. Vincent, she earned a master's degree in business education from the College of St. Rose.         Surviving are a brother and sister, Jack and Rosalie Scaglione, both of Queens.         Correction:  September 26, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Sept. 12 on Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, misidentified her Roman Catholic order. The order, which runs the institute, is the Sisters of Charity, not the Sisters of Mercy.       
         Helen A. Wilson, a retired executive for international refugee and development agencies, died Friday at her house in Washington. She was 79 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, said Marion Connell, a colleague and friend.         Reared in the Brooklyn Heights section of Brooklyn, Miss Wilson graduated from Barnard College and earned a master's degree from the Fordham University School of Social Work. She then worked for adoption and foster-care agencies in New York City before joining the International Social Service, which works to reunite families separated by war.         After World War II, the United Nations' Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Administration sent Miss Wilson to Algeria and Italy, where she lived in the refugee camps she administered. After holding various positions with international agencies in Switzerland and North Africa, she joined the Peace Corps when it was founded, serving as deputy director of program development and coordination and later becoming acting director of private and international organizations.         In 1965, she joined the United States Agency for International Development, filling a number of posts before her retirement in 1977.         Miss Wilson leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Helen Findlay, a prominent figure in the arts in Chicago and the director of the Wally Findlay Galleries there, died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 83 years old.         She died after a long illness, said Bob Ryan, the treasurer of the gallery.         Miss Findlay, a native of Kansas City, Mo., and a Vassar graduate, was also treasurer of Wally Findlay Galleries International, which has headquarters in Chicago with branches on East 57th Street in midtown Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Fla., and in Paris. The galleries, founded in Kansas City in 1870 by William Wadsworth Findlay, are among the oldest to remain in the families of the original owners.         After Vassar, Miss Findlay joined her family at the Findlay Galleries in Kansas City. Her brother Walstein C. Findlay Jr. established the Chicago branch in 1932, and she was involved in the business there since the early 1940's.         The Municipal Art League of Chicago cited her as Woman of the Year in 1959, and Gov. James R. Thompson proclaimed Dec. 16, 1980, to be Helen Findlay Day in honor of her contributions to the arts and, as a fund-raiser, to charity.         In addition to her brother, who lives in Palm Beach, she is survived by another brother, William A. Sr., of the Florida Keys.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Jenkins Kinnear, a former director of the Garden Club of America, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Ala. She was 94 years old and lived in Birmingham.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Polly Lincoln.         Mrs. Kinnear was a horticultural and artistic judge and a director of the Garden Club of America from 1977 to 1979, when she received the club's Zone Horticultural Award. A native of Butler, Pa., she graduated from Allegheny College in 1920.         Mrs. Kinnear's husband, James W. Kinnear Jr., a vice president of United States Steel, now the USX Corporation, died in 1990. She is survived by two sons, James W. 3d, of Greenwich, Conn., president and chief executive officer of Texaco Inc., and Peter, of Birmingham; a daughter, Polly Lincoln of West Hartford, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Pamela Hollingworth, who drew national attention at the age of 5 when she was lost for eight days in a New Hampshire forest, died on Sept. 11 at her home in Orleans, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 56 years old and also had a home in Sarasota, Fla, where she retired recently.         She died of a heart ailment, her family said.         Miss Hollingworth was a former vice president of the American Cancer Society.         In October 1941, she was lost for eight days on Mount Chocorua, a 3,475-foot peak in the White Mountains National Forest, after wandering away from a picnic wearing only overalls and sneakers.         Her disappearance touched off a search by more than 400 rescue workers. She had nothing to eat but drank often from mountain brooks. Despite freezing nighttime temperatures, she was found unharmed two miles from the picnic site.         When the little girl was reunited with her father, her first words were, "Daddy, I've been waiting for you."         Miss Hollingworth was born in Lowell, Mass., and grew up there and in Chelmsford nearby. She graduated from Smith College in 1958 and started a public relations career in New York.         She became the editorial director of the Arthritis Foundation, corporate communications director for Lane Bryant, vice president for creative services at the Cancer Society and communications director of the United States Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund.         Survivors include her mother, Blanche, of North Conway, N.H., and a brother, Joseph E. Hollingworth Jr., of Carlisle, Mass.       
         Marge R. Manderson, a program officer with the Southern Regional Council for more than 35 years, died Wednesday at her home in Atlanta. She was 64.         Miss Manderson died of bone cancer, said Ellen Spears, a spokeswoman for the council.         A native of Atlanta, Miss Manderson joined the Southern Regional Council, a civil rights advocacy group, in 1954, shortly after the United States Supreme Court decided the Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case. Steve Suitts, the council's executive director, said she did so because she believed it important that whites work for school desegregation.         Miss Manderson is survived by her mother, Margaret Freeman, of Atlanta.       
         Esta Brodey Huttner, a founder and longtime board member of the Karen Horney Foundation, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83 years old.         Her family said she died of cardiopulmonary failure.         She underwent psychotherapy with a disciple of Karen Horney, the German-born psychoanalyst whose methods departed from Freudian orthodoxy. She then befriended Dr. Horney and was so impressed with the analyst's work that she joined a group of people who decided to carry it on.         When Dr. Horney died in 1952, the Karen Horney Foundation was formed. It raised funds to start a clinic that would offer affordable or free services and serve as a training center for psychotherapists.         The Karen Horney Clinic opened in Manhattan in 1955. Mrs. Huttner was vice chairman of the board of directors from then until 1975, and continued as a director into the 1980's.         Mrs. Huttner, who was born in Brooklyn, started a business career as a millinery buyer for a department store. From 1946 to 1960, she operated a Brooklyn glass factory, Peerless Art, creating hand-painted designs on glass.         In 1975 she became the first national administrator for the Cancer Research Institute in Manhattan, which finances immunological research looking for a cancer cure. Mrs. Huttner retired in 1983.         Mrs. Huttner is survived by a son, Dr. James F. Brodey of West Hartford, Conn.; a stepson, Richard Huttner of Middletown, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Hilary Fylstra of Lake Tahoe, Nev.; a sister, Celia Hartley of New Port Richey, Fla.; and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Patricia Phipps Buckley, a psychotherapist practicing in Manhattan and Queens, died in an accident on Aug. 30 in Southington, Conn. She was 61 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         A police report said she died of multiple injuries received in a fall while on a hiking trip.         Ms. Buckley, a native of Rockville Center, L.I., graduated in nursing and psychology from Adelphi University. She held an M.S. degree in counseling and psychology from Miami University and did postgraduate work in vocational rehabilitation and psychology at Columbia University.         She was a former director of the Manhattan Center for the Living, a voluntary nonprofit organization for people with chronic illnesses. She was also a member of the board of directors for Unicef in New York.         In addition to her practice, Ms. Buckley was involved with Catholic Charities, making home visits to care for patients terminally ill with AIDS-related diseases. She was also an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.         Ms. Buckley is survived by her son, Thomas L. Thron of San Francisco, and her fiance, Herbert Boyer of Manhattan.       
         Eleanor H. Raynolds, an executive search consultant who was honored by the Queen of England for her work for the British-American Chamber of Commerce, died on Tuesday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 55 years old and lived in Stamford.         The cause of her death was a massive staphylococcus infection, said Penny Paul Mooney, an associate at Ward Howell, the executive search firm where she was a partner. She said the cause of the infection has not been determined.         Mrs. Raynolds joined Ward Howell in 1985. Founder of Peer Group         During the early 1980's, she served consecutive terms as president of the British-American Chamber of Commerce, for which she was made a Commander of the British Empire. She was also a founder of the Peer Group, a national association of women in management and the arts, and served as a director of the New York Mission Society, the Women's Economic Round table and Mary Baldwin College.         Together with her husband, John F. Raynolds 3d, former president of Outward Bound USA, she wrote "Beyond Success -- How Volunteer Service Can Help You Begin Making a Life Insead of Just a Living."         Mrs. Raynolds, who trekked in the Himalayas and the Andes and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had just returned from a horse-riding trip in Utah when she died.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, a son, Jayson Kuhn of Silver Spring, Md., and a daughter, Jennifer Irwin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and by two grandchildren.       
         Ann F. Friedlaender, an economist who was the first woman to become an academic dean at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 54 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.         She died of cancer, said Charles Ball, an M.I.T. spokesman.         Professor Friedlaender, who held a joint professorship in economics and civil engineering, was dean of M.I.T.'s School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1984 to 1990. In 1983 she was named chairwoman of the economics department.         She was also a director of the Rand Corporation and of Conrail.         Professor Friedlaender is survived by her husband, Stephen Friedlaender; two sons, Lucas Friedlaender and Nathaniel Friedlaender, both of Newton, and a brother, Alexander L. Fetter, of Palo Alto, Calif.       
         Edith Sable, a longtime civic leader who fostered voter participation and recruited public officials and business leaders to debate New York City's problems and future, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         For four decades Mrs. Sable was a League of Women Voters volunteer and officer. She was the economic development director of its New York chapter and was also on the national board.         She focused on the city's government structure, financing and management, as well as its economy. In the city and state fiscal crises in the 1970's, she convened seminars for officials and others to learn about and discuss finances and charter reform.         "Edith's meetings were one of the best sources of background information," said Elizabeth Cooke, then a municipal union lobbyist and now president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. "Personal and political agendas were pretty much put aside, and thoughtful people struggled with difficult issues." Published 'They Represent You'         Mrs. Sable's later conferences examined city management in 1979, the capital budget process in 1981, infrastructure in 1983, public authorities in 1985 and contract procedures in 1989. She also organized sessions on the city's economy with officials, executives and economists speaking and touring sites from the Fresh Kills landfill to the Hunts Point market.         She started the league's popular reference booklet "They Represent You and Your Community," listing elected officials with their addresses and telephone numbers and district maps.         When the city created community boards, she produced an explanatory pamphlet. And to visualize the city's economy and financing, she created charts titled "Money Go Round."         She also worked several stints in government. She served in the city transportation agency and in public relations for Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She was also an aide to Angier Biddle Duke and Eleanor Roosevelt at the United Nations.         Mrs. Sable, whose maiden name was Berger, was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University. Her husband of 48 years, Benjamin, died in 1986. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz, a great-grandniece of Chief Sitting Bull, who devoted her life to making American Indian culture available to other Americans, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 85 years old and had lived in Forest Hills, Queens, and Douglaston, Queens, since 1928.         She died of cancer, said Marjorie Weinberg, a family friend.         As director of the Indian Village at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island from 1930 to 1950, Rosebud, as she preferred to be called, enthralled legions of visitors with information about and stories from Indian culture.         Rosebud, who was born near Rapid City, S.D., was a descendant of the Lakota-Oyate, called the Sioux by the white settlers. Through her family's prominence, she came to know many well-known figures like President Calvin Coolidge, whom she helped induct into Lakota membership in 1927; Cecil B. DeMille, who tried to persuade her to star in his films, and the planner Robert Moses, who hired her for the Jones Beach post.         Last year Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was her name that inspired Orson Welles to make "Rosebud" the last word spoken by Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist of his 1941 film classic, "Citizen Kane." He based his assertion on what he said were recently discovered daily sign-in sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Mr. Welles and Rosebud worked on several dramatic shows during the late 1930's.         Mr. Welles, who died in 1985, never revealed the source for the name "Rosebud."         After leaving her post at Jones Beach in 1950, Rosebud continued to lecture and write on Indian culture. Her book, "The Album of the American Indian," was published in 1969 by Franklin Watts Inc., and a second book, "Tonewaya and the Eagles," was published in 1979 by Dial Press.         In 1989 Rosebud received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from the University of South Dakota. She had attended the university from 1925 to 1927.         Rosebud's first husband, Arthur de Cinq-Mars, died in 1949. A sister, Chauncina Yellow Robe White Horse, died in 1981.         Rosebud Yellow Robe Frantz is survived by her husband, Alfred Frantz; a daughter, Tachawin Moy, of Brooklyn; a granddaughter, Karen Winona Moy, of Manhattan; and a sister, Evelyn Robe Finkbeiner, of Bad Pyrmont and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.       
         Bertina Suida Manning, a scholar of Italian art and a collector of French and Italian paintings and drawings, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         She died of heart failure, said a friend, Mary Jane Harris.         Mrs. Manning was born in Vienna and was the only child of William E. Suida, an eminent Viennese art historian known for his work on Leonardo da Vinci and Genoese painting. She moved with her parents to the United States in 1939 and attended Queens College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she met her husband, Robert Lee Manning, an art collector who became director of the art gallery at Finch College in Manhattan.         With her father, she wrote a book on Luca Cambiaso, a 16th- century Genoese painter. From her father, Mrs. Manning inherited thousands of Italian and French paintings and drawings, to which she and her husband added major works. During the 1950's she advised the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. In 1962-63, she and her husband organized the first United States exhibition of Genoese painting, which traveled from Dayton, Ohio, to Sarasota, Fla., to Hartford. Since 1989 she had served as president of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College.         The Mannings were known for making their collection at their home available to students, curators and many others from around the world. Works from the Suida Manning collection have been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and the National Gallery in Washington, among other institutions. Paintings by Guercino and Mattia Preti are among the works now on loan to the Metropolitan, where they are on view in the museum's galleries of Baroque painting.         She is survived by her husband; her daughter, Sandy Manning Dolnier, and a grandson, John Robert Dylan.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Abigail Adams Eliot, a social worker who became a nationally known authority on early childhood education, died Thursday at the New England Deaconess Home, a nursing home in Concord, Mass. She had celebrated her 100th birthday on Oct. 9.         She died of a heart attack, said Jay Chrepta, a spokesman for Tufts University.         Dr. Eliot became active in the field after World War I, when the first few nursery schools with child study centers were set up in the United States.         After enrolling in the early 1920's at the Rachel MacMillan School and Training Center in London, one of the few schools that then trained nursery school teachers, Dr. Eliot returned to the United States, and she and Elizabeth W. Pearson, a Boston philanthropist, founded the Ruggles Street Nursery School in the Roxbury section of Boston. It taught children and also provided teacher-training in early childhood education.         In later years Dr. Eliot's institution evolved, becoming successively the Ruggles Street Nursery School and Training Center and the Nursery Training School of Boston. She was its director from 1922 until she retired in 1952.         That year, the institution was incorporated into Tufts, was moved to Medford, Mass., and was renamed the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University.         During the Depression, the Roosevelt Administration's Federal Emergency Relief Administration, with the cooperation of the United States Office of Education, organized what it called emergency nursery schools for needy children. Dr. Eliot, who was then secretary-treasurer of the National Association for Nursery Education, became a member of the National Advisory Committee for the program.         She was born in Boston, graduated from Radcliffe College in 1914 and was a social worker for several years. She received her doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1930.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Vanessa S. Lynn, a New York gallery director who wrote about contemporary American crafts, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center. She was 42 years old and lived in Valley Stream, L.I.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lynn held a B.A. degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton and an M.A. in library science from Queens College. During the 1970's she worked as an art and architecture librarian at Pratt Institute.         She was a founder, in 1979, of the Cooper/Lynn Gallery in Manhattan, which presented works in clay, fiber and metal. She was also an advocate for removal of the distinction between crafts and fine arts, a theme that permeated her writing.         In 1985, she became the director of Gallery at Workbench, based at the chain's main store at Park Avenue and 32d Street. It showed the creations of young furniture artists. She also traveled to Workbench's other stores in the city.         She was a regular contributor to periodicals, including American Craft, American Ceramics, Metalsmith, Ornament, Glass and the German crafts magazine Art Aurea. At the time of her death, she was associate editor of American Ceramics magazine.         Mrs. Lynn is survived by her husband, Lawrence R.; her mother and stepfather, Sylvia and Ralph Lippman of Manhattan; a brother, Keith Stanger of Ypsilanti, Mich., and four stepbrothers, David Lippman of Eureka, Calif., Dr. Jay Lippman of Manhattan, Jonathan Lippman of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Leonard Lippman of West Hartford, Conn.       
         Joann Thompson, a New York City health-care advocate and an advocate for social and religious causes, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a short illness, friends said.         Ms. Thompson organized and led the Health Action Resource Center since 1984. She was also a founder in 1979 of the Religious Committee on the New York City Health Crisis, of which she was executive director.         Among the issues her organizations focused on were reductions in government aid to health programs, health care for the poor, infant mortality, the spread of AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics, sickness among the homeless and the shortages of nurses and of treatment for drug addiction.         Born in Tifton, Ga., Ms. Thompson grew up in Austin, Tex. In 1956 she graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. There she worked with the Faith and Life Community, an ecumenical, interracial program of religious action in civil rights and other social issues.         After studying at Harvard Divinity School and Princeton Theological Seminary, she served on the faculty of the Ecumenical Institute in Chicago for 10 years.         Then she worked for the Young Women's Christian Association in St. Louis, New York City and San Francisco in programs for youth and community relations. In 1973 she became an administrator at the National Hemophilia Foundation in New York.         There are no immediate survivors.

         Regina Carrol, an actress who starred in many cult horror movies, died on Nov. 4 in St. George, Utah. She was 49 years old and had homes in St. George and in Palm Springs, Calif.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Al Adamson, a film director.         Miss Carrol, whose name was originally Regina Gelfan, was born in Boston. Her film credits included "Two Rode Together" with James Stewart, "The Slender Thread" with Sidney Poitier and "Viva Las Vegas" with Elvis Presley. She met her husband in 1969, when he was casting "Satan's Sadists," in which she starred, and appeared in many of his later films, including "The Female Bunch." Her last screen appearance was in "Carnival Magic" in 1982.         Miss Carrol also appeared on television in the "Dinah Shore Show," "Route 66" and "Ozzie and Harriet."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, Barney Gelfan, and a brother, Carl Gelfan, both of Los Angeles.       
         Elaine Whitelaw, for half a century the chief fund raiser and a major force for the March of Dimes, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of cancer, said her daughter, Patricia Snyderman of San Francisco.         In 1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tapped her to join the national women's committee of the March of Dimes, which he founded to fight polio, Miss Whitelaw recognized the philanthropic potential of middle-income Americans. By creating a network of volunteers and programs for children and mothers, she made them the backbone of one of the country's most successful charities.         A dozen years after it began, the March of Dimes was helping to rid America of polio and has used the network Miss Whitelaw created to continue financing the fight against a variety of birth defects. 'She Was Irresistible'         "She was the general of a volunteer army," said Beverly Sills, the national chairwoman of the March of Dimes and a longtime friend of Miss Whitelaw's.         As a fixture on the national charity-ball scene, Miss Whitelaw embodied can-do do-gooding. Both colleagues and those she tapped relentlessly for contributions said she practiced what she preached. They described her as demanding, innovative, boundlessly energetic and fiercely determined.         "When she approached me about becoming involved with the March of Dimes she said, 'Other charities want to put your name on their stationery. I want your time, your energy and your money,' " Ms. Sills recalled. "She was irresistible."         Roseamond Elaine Whitelaw was born on Nov. 21, 1914, the oldest child of Louis Whitelaw, a wealthy diamond merchant, and his wife, Dora. Along with two younger brothers, Seymour and Jordan, Miss Whitelaw grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College, where she studied American history and art. She returned and embarked on a lifelong mission of balancing society and its entitlements and the social obligations of Roosevelt's New Deal.         "There was no question that I was going to work," she said last year. "But of course I wasn't going to work at some perfume counter and take a job from someone who needed it." After a brief stint as a script reader, an early marriage that ended in divorce and the birth of her daughter, Patricia, she volunteered to raise money for the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. She moved on to volunteer for the National War Fund.         She later married Otto Brodnitz, an economist and stockbroker, and the couple lived on the Upper East side of Manhattan until his death in the mid-1970's.         After joining the March of Dimes in 1943, Miss Whitelaw created a network of volunteers who sought donations in cinemas and door to door. She also used her prodigious organizational abilities to help orchestrate the field tests of the Salk polio vaccine. "Her influence was all pervasive,' said Dr. Jonas Salk, founder of the Salk Institute in San Diego, Calif.  Serving Hot Meals         Later, along with Eleanor Lambert, she organized a fashion show to benefit the March of Dimes that Time magazine called "the event of the year." In 1976, she began "Gourmet Galas," dinners prepared in various cities by local celebrities and judged by culinary experts. Today, there are 40 different galas across the United States.         After retiring from the March of Dimes last year, Miss Whitelaw volunteered as a regional director of the Enterprise Foundation, a national organization involved in housing the poor. Increasingly concerned with homelessness, drug use and AIDS, she spent nights last winter riding a Planned Parenthood van and counseling women who lived or worked on the streets in the Bronx.         "The only way we're going to get them in for treatment is to feed them," she told a reporter at the time. "They don't know they might be sick. They know they're hungry, their children are hungry." Within days, she had cooking equipment and food donations, and, in her Adolfo suits and Ferragamo shoes, she helped serve hot meals from midnight to dawn.         One of the young women she fed, a runaway, took words from Miss Whitelaw's vocabulary to describe her. "She's a great dame," she said.         Miss Whitelaw is survived by her daughter; her brother, Seymour Whitelaw of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Georgia L. McMurray, a leader in developing services for children in New York City, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 58.         A quadriplegic, she had been suffering from a progressive nervous disease, said the Rev. Gerald L. Wagner, a friend.         Ms. McMurray was a former Commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development and deputy general director for programming of the Community Service Society of New York.         She was teaching as a professor at Fordham University's School of Social Work at the time of her death. She was also the president of a consulting firm, the GLM Group, which provides research, training, technical assistance and other management services to governmental and nonprofit organizations concerned with programs for children and families.         Her many honors included the Essence Award this year, given to her by Essence, a magazine for black women. This year, too, the Children's Aid Society cited her for distinguished service.         Ms. McMurray managed to continue her work even though her own disabilities forced her to walk on crutches.         Ms. McMurray was a graduate of Temple University and held a master's degree in social services from Bryn Mawr College. She came to public attention 22 years ago as the founder of Project Teen Aid for pregnant adolescents, which still exists.         The Lindsay administration tapped her in 1969 to develop services for young children and families as director of an Early Childhood Task Force. Two years later she became the first head of the child-development agency, an umbrella for the city's child-care and preschool programs not handled by the Board of Education. Under her guidance the number of day-care centers multiplied and the number of children served rose from 5,000 to 40,000.         She worked at the Community Service Society from 1978 to 1986, producing reports on homelessness and the changing demographics of urban poverty, and developing model programs for children and youths.         Ms. McMurray is survived by her mother, Daisy Fulen, and two sisters, Caroline Johnson and Narvine Fulen, all of Philadelphia.       
         Clara M. Hale, who nurtured hundreds of abandoned and orphaned babies, the most fragile victims of New York City's epidemics of drug abuse and AIDS, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mother Hale, as she was known, was a pioneer in self-help efforts in poor neighborhoods and came to symbolize the untapped potential of disadvantaged groups taking care of their own. She eventually won international recognition for her efforts, and President Ronald Reagan saluted her as an "American heroine" in his 1985 State of the Union address. Battled Bureaucrats         At times she battled government bureaucrats who resisted her unorthodox methods. But public support helped her gain government grants and persuade officials to bend rules like the requirement that young children be reared in private homes instead of the group care she provided.         She started her work with babies in 1969 in her Harlem home and soon moved the program to a five-story brownstone at 145 West 122d Street. In the early days, the babies slept in cribs next to Mother Hale's bed.         As recently as a few months ago, she kept at least one child in her room, often choosing the neediest one. She expressed frustration when failing health made her too weak to hold a baby. Took in Nearly 1,000 Infants         Aided by donations, a growing staff and volunteers, Hale House took in nearly 1,000 infants, many still trembling from withdrawal pangs after becoming addicted to drugs in the womb.         With nourishment, nurture and play, most of the addicted infants recovered from the effects of fetal drugs and alcohol. But those born infected with the AIDS virus faced a drastically shortened life of suffering that Hale House tried to alleviate.         Her program especially drew attention in the 1980's, when so-called boarder babies languished for months in municipal hospitals, at a cost of several hundred dollars a day for each one. No one else wanted them, and the city's social-services agency was ill-prepared to place them.         "I'm not an American hero -- I'm simply a person who loves children," Mrs. Hale said recently. Explaining her approach to the children, she said: "We hold them and touch them. They love you to tell them how great they are, how good they are. Somehow, even at a young age, they understand that. They're happy, and they turn out well."         She said she expected to keep caring for children "until I die."         Hale House's policy is to reunite children with their families after the parents recover from their addiction, and it says it has been able to do so with about 90 percent of the children. Some children remained exceptionally close to Mother Hale, who considered them part of her own family.         Mrs. Hale's philosophy and mission were rooted in the travails of her own life.         She grew up in Philadelphia. Her father was murdered when she was a child, and her mother took in boarders and ran a lunchroom for longshoremen. Mrs. Hale credited her mother -- who died when she was just 16 -- with instilling the values on which Hale House is based.         After high school, she married Thomas Hale. They moved to New York, where he ran a floor-waxing service and studied business administration in night classes at City College. Mrs. Hale worked as a domestic and cleaned Loews theaters. Left to Rear 3 Children         Her husband died of cancer when she was 27, leaving her to rear three children, Nathan, Lorraine and Kenneth. At first she cleaned homes by day and theaters by night.         But then, reluctant to leave her youngsters, she started taking in other children for $2 a week and eventually became a licensed foster parent. She took in seven or eight children at a time. Eventually she reared 40 foster children, keeping them out of trouble and steering them from the temptations and dangers of the street. She emphasized reading and good behavior, and frequently treated them to trips to museums and other outings.         All made it through high school and many went to college, and they rewarded Mrs. Hale with 60 children of their own whom she regarded as her grandchildren.         The next phase of Mrs. Hale's life started in 1969, by chance. Her daughter, Lorraine, was driving on 146th Street when she was distressed to see a drug-addicted woman on a crate nodding off with her 2-month-old baby slipping out of her arms. 'She Says You Sent Her'         Impulsively, Miss Hale stopped, got out and admonished the woman to seek drug treatment and temporarily leave the baby with Mrs. Hale -- then 63 years old and retired.         The next morning, they later recalled, Mother Hale telephoned Lorraine to say, "There's a junkie at my door, and she says you sent her." Lorraine confirmed that she had, and Mrs. Hale took the baby. Word spread, and soon a steady stream of babies were placed with her.         Lorraine Hale went on to earn doctorates in developmental psychology and child development. In the mid-1980's, she became the executive director of Hale House and later its president. She plans to continue operating Hale House and its growing programs at other sites.         Hale House was renovated in 1975 with aid from Percy E. Sutton, then the Manhattan Borough President, with nurseries, a central kitchen and dining room, a playground, and many mirrors, placed at a toddler's eye level.         Throughout the Beame and Koch administrations, Hale House won waivers from state regulations barring group nurseries for children under the age of 5. But in 1989, saying that the crack epidemic had crested and the city was doing better in finding foster homes for children, the Dinkins administration stopped referring children to Hale House. Increased Fund-Raising         Mrs. Hale refused to give up. The flow of children continued, brought to Hale House by desperate parents, police officers, churches and other groups. To finance their care without government money, Hale House increased its private fund-raising.         Its budget last year was $3.5 million, and Hale House has been championed over the years by celebrities like Lena Horne, John Lennon and Tony Bennett.         In the last two years, Hale House has expanded its programs. They include housing and educating mothers after detoxification; apprentice training for youths who start to stray, and a home for mothers and infants infected with the AIDS virus. The organization also hopes to create Hale Haven, a larger version of the original Hale House, which will continue to house infants.         In addition to her daughter, Lorraine, Mrs. Hale's survivors include two sons, Nathan and Kenneth, and several grandchildren.         A service will be held at noon on Wednesday at the Riverside Church on Riverside Drive at 122d Street in Manhattan, with viewing from 9 to 11:20 A.M.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Mary Green, a dancer, an actress, a writer and a longtime assistant to Agnes de Mille, died on Dec. 16 at St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. She was 82 years old.         She died of pancreatic cancer, said Miss de Mille, who announced the death yesterday.         Mrs. Green was trained at the Lester Horton school in Los Angeles and performed with the Lester Horton Dance Theater. Her film and theater roles included the player queen in the stage production of "Hamlet" starring Leslie Howard, and she played the dancer in a film version of "Romeo and Juliet" that starred Norma Shearer. With her husband, the late Dennis Green, she served as scriptwriter for "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," starring Basil Rathbone.         Mrs. Green was managing director of the Agnes de Mille Dance Theater from the 1960's through the early 70's, and she assisted Miss de Mille in her lecture appearances.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Strachan, a nurse-midwife and educator, died on Dec. 20 in Hartford. She was 84 and lived in Bloomfield, Conn.         She had been in failing health for some years, said Dr. Ruth Watson Lubic, the general director of the Maternity Center Association.         Miss Strachan ( pronounced STRACK-an) was the educational director and then the director of the School of Nurse-Midwifery from 1958 to 1970, when she retired. The school was established in 1931 by the Maternity Center Association, whose headquarters are on East 92d Street in Manhattan.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dr. Helene Wallace Toolan, a cancer researcher, died on Sunday at Southwestern Vermont Hospital Center in Bennington. She was 80 years old and lived in Old Bennington, Vt.         She died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her family said.         Dr. Toolan, a native of Chicago, graduated with honors from the University of Chicago at the age of 17 and received a Ph.D. in pathology from Cornell Medical Center. She was on the staff of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York from 1950 until 1964.         Dr. Toolan did basic research on the transplantation of human tumors and tissues into laboratory animals. In 1955 she received the Sloan Award for her work. Linked Cancers to Virus         She also studied the relationship between viruses and human cancer cells, leading a team of researchers that succeeded in linking viruses to eight types of human cancer in 1960. Previously only leukemia, a cancer affecting the blood, had been linked to a virus.         In 1964 Dr. Toolan moved to Bennington to direct the newly established Putnam Memorial Institute for Medical Research. In 1987 the institute was renamed the Helene W. Toolan Institute for Medical Research. She became director emeritus and senior scientist of the institute in 1978 and director emeritus and trustee in 1985.         Dr. Toolan was also an avid gardener, horticulturist and ornithologist, and participated in a project to beautify downtown Bennington in the early 1970's. The Garden Club of America gave her its Horticulural Award in 1982.         Her first husband, Dr. Edward Wallace, died in 1943. She later married Dr. James M. Toolan, who survives her. Also surviving are two sons, Robin Wallace of Gainesville, Fla., and Alan Wallace of Las Vegas, Nev.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Rebecca Ann Donovan, a sociologist and an associate professor at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Robert Bazell, a friend.         Professor Donovan was the head of research at the Hunter College School of Social Work. She specialized in the study of the social consequences of economic change, such as the impact of job loss on individuals.         She was born in Peoria, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in 1968 and a doctorate from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1983. Before joining the Hunter faculty, she taught at New York University and Columbia, where she was research director of the school's Industrial Social Welfare Center.         She is survived by her companion, Susan Hajjar; her mother, Sarah Donovan of Winter Park, Fla., and a sister, Janette Harriott of Edmond, Okla.       
         Harriett Swenney Crowley, a retired editor who was also an administrator of American aid to third world countries, died Dec. 16 in Hendersonville, N.C. She was 79.

         Katrina Haslip, a former New York State prison inmate who became an advocate for increased governmental and private support for women with AIDS, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 33 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Haslip died of complications from AIDS, said Theresa McGovern, director of the H.I.V. Law Project of the AIDS Service Center of Lower Manhattan.         Ms. Haslip was a native of Niagara Falls, N.Y. Her H.I.V. was diagnosed while she was in the Bedford Hills Correctional Center in the late 1980's after she was convicted of picking pockets. She founded two organizations, ACE, for AIDS Counseling and Education Program, and, after her release in 1990, its sister program, ACE-OUT, to help women with AIDS in and out of prison do more for themselves.         She also joined with other AIDS organizations, including Life Force, a Brooklyn-based program, the Brooklyn Task Force on AIDS, and the Upper Manhattan Task Force on AIDS, which worked to press the Federal Government to expand its efforts to fight AIDS among women.         Because of her efforts, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month announced plans to expand its definition of the disease to include more illnesses that affect women with AIDS.       
         Lois Braun, a member of the board of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues, died yesterday at her home in Larchmont, N.Y. She was 73 years old.

         Ruth Sleeper, a national leader in nursing education who helped raise academic standards for the nursing profession, died Thursday at her home in Braintree, Mass. She was 93.         She died after a long illness, said the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had been director of both the Nursing Service and School of Nursing from 1946 to 1966.         Miss Sleeper was a past president of the National League of Nursing Education and the National League for Nursing.         She helped lead the way in transforming nursing education by greatly expanding classroom instruction. She developed a curriculum that combined nine months of practical training with 28 months of academic classes.         Miss Sleeper, a native of Manchester, N.H., started her own nursing career at Massachusetts General, where she earned a diploma at the age of 23. Later she earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University's Teachers College.         She was an adviser to the State Department and was a representative to the Status of Women Commission at the United Nations. She was also an officer in the United Community Services, American Red Cross, International Council of Nurses and Nursing Advisory Council of the Veterans Administration.         Although retired, Ms. Sleeper remained active professionally until her death, advising two nursing schools.         She is survived by several nieces, grandnieces and grandnephews.
