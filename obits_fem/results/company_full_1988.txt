        Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         Florence Eiseman, a designer of children's clothes who was known for excellent workmanship, top quality fabrics and simple but elegant styles, died of emphysema Friday at Columbia Hospital in Milwaukee, Wis. She was 88 years old and lived in Milwaukee.         A native of Minneapolis, Mrs. Eiseman began her career in 1945 when her husband, Laurence, packed up some of the dainty, organdy pinafores she made as gifts for friends and took them to a buyer at Chicago's Marshall Field & Company. He came home with a $3,000 order.         Ten years later she became the first children's designer to receive the Neiman Marcus award for her contributions to fashion, an honor that has also gone to Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, James Galanos and Norman Norell. Designs Honored by Museum         Early features of Mrs. Eiseman designs included French seams, hand-sewn hems, bound buttonholes and hand-rolled edges. Among those who dressed their children in her clothes were Princess Grace of Monoco, members of the Kennedy family and Elizabeth Taylor.         In 1964 the Denver Art Museum highlighted her career in a fashion retrospective that is believed to be the first time that a designer of children's wear was so honored by a museum.         ''Florence Eiseman has been one of the most influential figures in the children's fashion industry over the last several decades,'' said Carla Slocum, vice president and merchandise manager of children's wear for Saks Fifth Avenue. ''She was responsible for raising the standards of fashion and quality in better children's wear.''         Mr. Eiseman worked closely with his wife until his death in 1967. Their sons, Robert and Laurence Jr., then shared management with their mother and today are chief executive officer and president of the Florence Eiseman Inc. respectively.         In addition to her sons, Mrs. Eiseman is survived by a sister, Eva Tankel, of Minneapolis, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

For some time Mrs. Vaughan had been suffering from Cushing's disease, a disorder of the adrenal cortex.         She made her directorial debut in Central Park in 1961 when she staged Shakespeare's ''Richard II,'' starring Ben Hayes and J. D. Cannon. She had first gone to work for the festival's founder, Joseph Papp, as an unpaid volunteer, cutting scripts, sewing costumes and collecting props.         She subsequently directed several festival productions. In 1962 she directed a touring company production of ''Macbeth'' and co-directed ''King Lear'' with Mr. Papp. She also staged ''The Winter's Tale'' (1963), ''Othello'' (1964), ''Coriolanus'' (1965) and ''Macbeth'' (1966).         Mrs. Vaughan taught Shakespearean acting at the festival and at Circle in the Square Theater School. She took up painting in 1970 and worked in the Abstract Expressionist style in Los Angeles and New York.         Mrs. Vaughan's marriage to the director Stuart Vaughan ended in divorce.

        La Meri, the dancer, teacher, writer and dance ethnologist, died in a San Antonio hospital on Jan. 7. She was 89 years old.         La Meri, the dancer, teacher, writer and dance ethnologist, died in a San Antonio hospital on Jan. 7. She was 89 years old.         Described as ''the indisputed queen of ethnic dance'' by Walter Sorrell, the dance writer, La Meri was long considered the leading American authority on the subject, particularly the dance of India and Spain. She toured the world at the height of her career, in the 1920's and 30's, studying and performing in South and Central America, Europe, Scandinavia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Burma, Malaya, Java, the Philippines, China, Japan, Ceylon and Hawaii.         She founded the School of Natya with Ruth St. Denis in 1940 in New York, where she taught and performed with her company, the Five Natyas, and presented such guest lecturers as Pearl S. Buck, Coomaraswamy, Lin Yutang, Ted Shawn and Argentinita. Her book ''Spanish Dancing,'' published in 1948, was considered by many to be the definitive text on Spanish dance.         La Meri, whose real name was Russell Meriwether Hughes, was born in Louisville, Ky. She received her first dance training in San Antonio, where she studied ballet and Spanish and Mexican dance as a child. She later studied Hawaiian dancing in Hawaii and, in New York City, modern dance with Michio Ito and ballet with Aaron Tomaroff and Ivan Tarasoff. Dancing Before Movies         La Meri made her professional stage debut in 1924 in San Antonio, where she danced prologues to silent movies. In New York, she performed with Maria Montero and was a featured vaudeville performer with Keith Time and in the 1949 Broadway revue ''A Night in Spain.'' Her first major work was ''Krishna Gopala,'' presented in 1940 with St. Denis and Hadassah as guest artists. She also created an interpretation of ''Swan Lake'' in the Bharata Natyam school of Indian classical dance and created many dances in the styles of other cultures. ''An afternoon with Miss La Meri is rather like being shown a small corner of some connoisseur's collection of choreographiana,'' John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1940 in a review of one of La Meri's many New York appearances.         She taught and performed with her own company at the New York School of Natya, which was absorbed into the Ethnologic Dance Center she founded in 1942. The school continued until 1956 and was an important source of training in ethnic dancing. La Meri taught at universities across the nation. She also taught and performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and taught at the Juilliard School in New York. On her retirement in 1970, La Meri established Ethnic Dance Arts Inc. in Hyannis, Mass., where she presented an annual ethnic dance festival and awards.         La Meri wrote six volumes of poetry and five books on dance esthetics, technique and composition. Her extensive collection of material on ethnic dance, given to the New York Public Library in 1948 and 1962, is a major holding of the library's Dance Collection. In 1972, La Meri received the Capezio Award.       
        Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         An interior and furniture designer, Pat Hoffman, as she was known professionally, was influential in introducing avant-garde and early 20th-century European designs to the United States.         Ms. Hoffman was born March 7, 1943, in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Design. From 1965 to 1970, she worked as director of design for Koch & Lowy, a lighting firm in New York City. After spending two years in Rome working for an architectural firm, Ms. Hoffman returned to New York to join I.C.F., in charge of the company's design programs, including graphics, advertising and showroom design.         For the last 15 years, Ms. Hoffman was instrumental in introducing designs that quickly became synonymous with the avant-garde. In the early 1970's, that included Giovanetti's Anfibio sofa, by Alessandro Becchi, an oversize leather upholstered raftlike sofa bed from Italy and the Interlubke system, a sleek German storage system. Introduced International Designs         Most influential in the modern home furnishings field was Ms. Hoffman's introduction in 1975 of the furniture designs by Josef Hoffmann, the Viennese leader of the early 20th-century Wiener Werkstatte movement. The Hoffmann furniture designs were pivotal in the rediscovery and revival of many other early 20th-century classics and played a critical role in the current interest in this important period of 20th-century design.         A lamp Ms. Hoffman designed in 1969 was exhibited in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985. Some of her other furniture designs have been shown at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, as well as at the Mobelmesse, in Cologne, West Germany, the Salon International de Meubles in Paris and the Saloni di Mobili in Milan.         Ms. Hoffman is survived by her husband, Samuel Friedman, president of I.C.F.; her parents, John and Mae Hoffman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a sister, Jane Knaus.         The funeral will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.

Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Miss Somogi's early successes were at the New York City Opera, where she made her 1974 debut in ''The Mikado'' and ''La Traviata,'' thus becoming the company's first female conductor. Yet, the preponderance of her career was centered in Europe. Beginning in 1981, Miss Somogi became first Kapellmeister under Michael Gielen at the Frankfurt Opera and left there only last year with the departure of Mr. Gielen and the dismantling of his organization. Miss Somogi's last appearance was six months ago conducting ''Das Rheingold'' in Frankfurt.         She never returned to the New York stage after moving to West Germany.

At the time Miss Somogi was hired in Frankfurt, Mr. Gielen said: ''We took her because she was the best. Our orchestra has some old experienced hands who cannot be taught very much. Within five minutes she had them on the edge of their seats.''         Judith Somogi was born in Brooklyn of a Hungarian father and a Sicilian mother. She said she had gained valuable experience as a church organist and choir director in Lynbrook, L.I., and as a pianist, she went on earn two degrees at Juilliard. ''Conducting,'' Miss Somogi once said, ''is something you learn by doing.''         She is survived by her parents, Louis and Antonina, and by her sister, Jane, all of Lynbrook.

In 1925, she became the lead actress for Pirandello, the ground-breaking dramatist whose work often focused on the thin line between illusion and reality. Pirandello, who was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature, is considered by many to be one of the great writers of the 20th century European theater. Toured Together         After spending years in Rome performing such Pirandello plays as ''Six Characters in Search of An Author,'' the playwright and Miss Abba went on tour in Italy and abroad, including the United States, France, Britain and Germany.

She and her husband were divorced in 1975. She is survived by her daughters, Christina Newman and Susan Olds, and a granddaughter.       
        Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         With such campaigns as ''What's a woman to do'' for Total cereal and ''Bake a Gold Medal memory'' for the flour brand, Mrs. Kennedy rose to prominence in a field with few women executives. Working for what was then Dancer-Fitzgerald-Sample Inc., she was Chicago's Advertising Woman of the Year in 1960. She moved to the company's office in New York two years later to become a senior vice president and creative director.         For several years until she retired last year, Mrs. Kennedy also headed the company's creative review board and the creative strategy advisory board. Evaluated Campaign Ideas         Eventually, as chairman of D.F.S.'s creative review and advisory boards, she evaluated all campaign ideas before the client got to see them. In 1972, she also started a continually updated project meant to guide advertisers in their approach to women.         A native of Wilmington, Del., Mrs. Kennedy attended public schools and started writing copy for Compton Advertising in New York in 1939, leaving for D.F.S. in 1947. Saatchi & Saatchi, which had taken over Compton and D.-F.S. separately, merged them into the present firm last year.         Mrs. Kennedy, is survived by two sons, Edward C. of Lexington, Ky., and Stephen D. of Watertown, Mass.; a daughter, Dr. Katherine K. Treadway of Weston; a sister, Elizabeth Hudson of Dover, Del.; a brother, Edward Midlam of Lake Charles, La., and eight grandchildren.         A funeral service will be held at 2 P.M. tomorrow at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, Fifth Avenue at 53d Street.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Marguerite Belleri, a member of the Metropolitan Opera Chorus for 57 years, died of heart failure Saturday evening at Hempstead (L.I.) Hospital. She was 93 years old.  Mrs. Belleri, born Gretl Maerkl in Traunstein, Bavaria, was engaged for the Met in 1910 when still a Munich schoolgirl.

        Jo Henderson, a stage and film actress who was nominated for a Tony Award in 1984, died in an automobile accident Saturday in Chinle, Ariz. She was 54 years old and lived in Pomona, N.Y.         Jo Henderson, a stage and film actress who was nominated for a Tony Award in 1984, died in an automobile accident Saturday in Chinle, Ariz. She was 54 years old and lived in Pomona, N.Y.         Ms. Henderson was driving home to Pomona from an engagement at the La Jolla Playhouse in California when her car skidded and collided with an oncoming vehicle, killing her instantly, according to a police report.         A professional actress for more than 30 years, Ms. Henderson appeared on Broadway and in numerous Off-Broadway and regional playhouse productions.         Her performance in 1976 as the widowed mother of four young daughters in ''Ladyhouse Blues,'' produced by the Phoenix Theater Company, won her an Obie award. Eight years later she received a nomination for a Tony as best featured actress in ''Play Memory,'' a short-lived Broadway production in which she received critical acclaim.         Ms. Henderson appeared in a number of productions of the Circle Repertory Company, the American National Theater and Academy, the Yale Repertory, the Seattle Repertory, the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center and the Ensemble Studio Theater.         On screen, Ms. Henderson starred in ''Lianna,'' a 1983 film directed by John Sayles.         Ms. Henderson was born in Buffalo and raised in Kalamazoo, Mich. She came to New York after attending Michigan State University and went into the theater.         She is survived by her mother, Jean Dehnel of Daytona, Fla.; a son, Christopher Jones of Boston, and a brother, Robert Henderson of Penn Yan, N.Y.

        Ann Seranne, a food consultant and a former editor at Gourmet magazine who wrote more than two dozen cookbooks, died Saturday at Newton Memorial Hospital in Newton, N.J. Ms. Seranne, who had suffered a stroke earlier, was 75 years old and lived in Newton.         Ann Seranne, a food consultant and a former editor at Gourmet magazine who wrote more than two dozen cookbooks, died Saturday at Newton Memorial Hospital in Newton, N.J. Ms. Seranne, who had suffered a stroke earlier, was 75 years old and lived in Newton.         Ms. Seranne, who was born in Hamilton, Ontario, came to the United States in 1936. Writing about her on several occasions, the former New York Times food editor and restaurant critic, Craig Claiborne, called Ms. Seranne ''a born cook.'' Among her accomplishments, Mr. Claiborne said, she ''made the best pies in the world.''         Since Ms. Seranne admitted to having a sweet tooth, it is not surprising that many of her books concerned desserts. Among them were ''The Complete Book of Desserts'' (Doubleday, 1963) and ''Delectable Desserts'' (Little Brown, 1962). ''Those books got me started,'' said Maida Heatter, a nationally known expert on desserts. ''They're just as important today as then.'' Breeder of Yorkshire Terriers         Other books by Ms. Seranne, published mostly in the 1950's and 60's, included ''Ann Seranne's Good Food and How to Cook It''; ''Good Food Without Meat''; ''The Blender Cookbook''; ''Your Home Freezer''; ''The Complete Book of Home Preserving''; ''The Art of Egg Cookery''; ''The Best of Near Eastern Cookery,'' and ''The Sandwich Book.'' The last three were illustrated with photographs by Eileen Gaden, her partner in Seranne & Gaden, a food consulting company formed in the mid-1950's. They both had previously been editors at Gourmet magazine.         Although she never lost her enthusiasm for cooking, Ms. Seranne had been breeding Yorkshire terriers for the last 25 years and was the author of ''The Joy of Breeding Your Own Show Dog.'' With Barbara Wolferman, she owned Mayfair Yorkie House, a kennel in Newton, N.J.         Ms. Seranne is survived by a niece and nephew, Donna and Clifford Morden of Burlington, Ontario.

        Marisa Bellisario, president of Italy's Italtel telecommunications company and former head of Olivetti Corporation of America, died of cancer today at her home in Turin. She was in her early 50's.         Marisa Bellisario, president of Italy's Italtel telecommunications company and former head of Olivetti Corporation of America, died of cancer today at her home in Turin. She was in her early 50's.         Miss Bellisario was appointed managing director and chief executive officer of the state-owned Italtel group in 1981. Italtel, formally Italtel Societa Italiana Telecomunicazione, is the 34th largest company in Italy, according to reports, and one of several telecommunications operations in that nation.         When she took over, losses were more than $215 million a year. She cut the losses in half in 1982 and then returned it to profitability, where it has remained under her direction.         She wrote her own life story in the book ''Woman and Top Manager,'' frequently worked 12-hour days, but refused to work weekends in order to spend the time with her husband, Lionello Cantoni, a mathematics professor.         ''Maybe I can show young girls that you can make it and still be a normal woman, with normal attitudes toward your family or husband,'' she said.         Before joining Italtel, Miss Bellisario was president and chief executive of Olivetti of America. She joined the company in 1972 and became director of corporate planning and then director of the Distributed Data Processing group.

Miss Norden appeared in many films in the late 1940's and 1950's, including ''An Ideal Husband,'' ''Mine Own Executioner,'' ''The Idol of Paris,'' ''Interrupted Journey'' and ''The Black Widow.'' A protegee of the British director Sir Alexander Korda, she was considered a leading postwar British sex symbol. She won a Venice Festival award for most promising actress in 1947, and the British National Film Award for her performance in ''Saints and Sinners'' in 1949.

        Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Groman was born in New Britain, Conn., where she studied ballet with Lillian Sjovall before moving to New York at the age of 11 to study at the Professional Children's School and at the American Ballet Theater School. She danced a wide variety of corps and solo roles in the City Ballet through the 1950's and then became a soloist in Ballet Theater in the early 1960's.         Miss Groman left a few years later to join the First Chamber Dance Quartet, a small troupe that been formed in 1961 by two dancers she had known in the City Ballet, Lois Bewley and William Carter. After that troupe disbanded in 1969, Miss Groman and Charles Bennett, a member of the first troupe, formed the First Chamber Dance Company. Original Choreography         Like the Quartet, the First Chamber Dance Company made its mark by touring extensively and presenting original choreography. Miss Groman and Mr. Bennett were joined by Michael Uthoff, Lisa Bradley and Marjorie Mussman, all former Joffrey Ballet members. Unlike the Quartet, which concentrated on ballets by its own members, the second group also drew from outside choreographers.         In recent years, Miss Groman headed the Groman Dance and Exercise School in New York.         She is survived by her father, Walter E., of New Britain; and three brothers, Walter J., of Toronto, John E., of Dedham, Mass., and Dr. David B., of Prince Edward Island, Canada.       
        Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Dorothy Scott Gerber, the widow of Daniel F. Gerber, who founded the Gerber Products Company, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Fremont, Mich., according to a company spokesman. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Gerber played a key role in the introduction of Gerber baby food in 1928. Tired of straining foods for her own children, it occurred to her that if the Fremont Canning Company could puree tomatoes, it could also puree fruits and vegetables. Fremont was the predecessor to Gerber Products; the name was changed in 1941.         Her husband thought the idea was sound and that other mothers might welcome commercially strained baby foods if they could be sold cheaply at regular grocery outlets.         The first batches of strained vegetables were then produced. Mrs. Gerber, a native of Ithaca, Mich., who married Daniel Gerber in 1923, liked them and, more important, so did her 7-month-old daughter Sally. The new baby food was priced at 15 cents, considerably cheaper than similar foods, which until then had been obtainable largely through drug stores at 40 to 60 cents each.         Besides her daughter, Sally Phinny of Fremont, Mrs. Gerber is survived by four other children, Paula Warm of Grand Rapids, Mich., and Gay Cummings, Scottie Merrill and Daniel Gerber Jr., all of Fremont. She is also survived by 18 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.       
        Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and         Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and London.         As Bonita Granville, the actress was the epitome of malevolent little girls, particularly in ''These Three,'' Lillian Hellman's heterosexual film adaptation of her play about lebsianism, ''The Children's Hour.'' The performance won the actress a 1936 Oscar nomination.         Among her more than 50 other movies were ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Maid of Salem'' (1937), ''Quality Street'' (1937), ''Now Voyager'' (1942) and ''Hitler's Children'' (1943). The spunky blond actress also played the inquisitive title role in the ''Nancy Drew'' detective-reporter series. A Family of Entertainers         She was born in Manhattan on Feb. 2, 1923, into a family of entertainers and went on the stage at 3. She became a leading lady in films of the late 40's and retired from the screen in 1947 to marry Mr. Wrather. She appeared occasionally in television plays and, in 1958, became the associate producer of her husband's popular ''Lassie'' television series and later its producer.         Mr. Wrather was a founding member of the ''kitchen cabinet'' of prominent Californians who encouraged Ronald Reagan to run for Governor in 1967, and he and his wife were close friends of the Reagans. In a statment by the White House yesterday, the President and his wife lauded Mrs. Wrather as ''a warm and caring friend'' who had for so many years ''enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love.''         Mrs. Wrather held a series of major executive posts in the Wrather Corporation and succeeded her husband as board chairman after his death in 1984, holding the post until last January, when the company was sold to the Walt Disney Company and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Limited, a Hong Kong investment concern. Civic Appointments         Mrs. Wrather was the chairman of the American Film Institute, a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center and of Loyola Marymount University, a director and former president of the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, a member of the advisory committee of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a founder and board member of the Los Angeles Music Center and a board member of the Women's Council of the Public Broadcasting Service's Channel 28 there.         For her work on the ''Lassie'' television series and for talks around the country in behalf of environmental conservation, Mrs. Wrather received a Boy Scouts of America National Award and a National 4-H Congress Conservation Award.         Surviving are two daugthers, Molly Dolle and Linda Finocchiaro; a son, Christopher, and nine grandchildren, all of the Los Angeles area.       
        Ursula Nordstrom, the former publisher and editor in chief of juvenile books at Harper & Row, and an innovative force in children's book publishing, died of ovarian cancer yesterday at the New Milford (Conn.) Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Bridgewater, Conn.         Ursula Nordstrom, the former publisher and editor in chief of juvenile books at Harper & Row, and an innovative force in children's book publishing, died of ovarian cancer yesterday at the New Milford (Conn.) Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Bridgewater, Conn.         Miss Nordstrom is credited with helping to change children's books from moralistic works written for adult approval to works directed at the emotions, imaginations and problems of children. The New York Times called her books ''milestones along the path of children's literature.''         In 1945 Miss Nordstrom edited E. B. White's first children's book, ''Stuart Little.'' In 1952 the author unexpectedly presented her with his only copy of the manuscript of ''Charlotte's Web,'' and she described the moment with the relish and enthusiasm of someone who treasured writers.         ''I was overwhelmed,'' she wrote in an article in The New York Times Book Review in 1974. ''I didn't dare take a chance on losing the manuscript on the train home, or whatever. So I sat down and began to read.'' Respect for Children         Miss Nordstrom exhibited equal respect for her audience of children, appealing to their fantasies as well as their fears. She edited books about divorce, alcoholism and loneliness. One of her authors, Louise Fitzhugh, wrote in ''The Long Secret,'' about a girl's first menstruation. ''William's Doll,'' which told of a boy who wanted a doll, appalled many men in publishing and enthralled feminists, who felt it was appropriate training for fatherhood.         In 1963 Miss Nordstrom published Maurice Sendak's ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' filled with the aggressive and hairy monsters of a child's fantasy, after other publishing houses had rejected it, said Charlotte Zolotow, a former vice president of Harper & Row and Miss Nordstrom's colleague.         ''With her incomparable editorial genius, Ursula Nordstrom transformed the American children's book into a genuine art form,'' Mr. Sendak said yesterday. ''I was there, one of her eager apprentices, profiting immensely from her intuition and her generous heart. She was the best of mommas, the best of teachers, the best of friends.''         ''She was one of the great innovators,'' said Mrs. Zolotow, who worked with Miss Nordstrom for more than 40 years and who is the author of 60 children's books. ''She liked realistic books, where parents weren't always dear and good and children faced problems in their lives.''         Miss Nordstrom also risked writing her own book, ''The Secret Language,'' about life in a girl's boarding school that must have resembled those she attended. It became an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960. Own Imprint in the 70's         Miss Nordstrom, who was born in Manhattan, began at Harper & Row in 1936. She became head of the children's book department in 1940 and in 1960 became the publishing company's first female vice president. In 1973, she stepped down as publisher and continued as senior editor with her own imprint until 1979. Among her other authors were Ruth Krauss, Shel Silverstein, Toni Ungerer, Laura Ingalls Wilder and Garth Williams.         Her books have won many awards, including three Newbury Medals for literature and two Caldecott Medals for illustration, the most important children's book awards.         With her at the time of death was her longtime companion, Mary Griffith. There are no survivors.       
        Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Known to the dance world, including hundreds of students, as Geordie Graham, she was also the director of the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance from the 1940's through the 1960's. In the 1930's, she married Winthrop Sargeant, who became the music and dance critic of The New Yorker magazine. They were divorced in the 1940's and Miss Graham devoted herself full-time to her administative duties at the school.         The youngest of the three Graham sisters who were born in Allegheny, Pa., and who moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1908, Georgia followed Martha Graham into the Denishawn school in Los Angeles during World War I. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, considered among the founders of the modern-dance movement, enlisted the teaching talents of both Graham sisters before they recognized them as performers. A Star With Denishawn Troupe         Mr. Shawn nonetheless made Martha Graham a star in his Aztec ballet, ''Xochitl,'' only to see her leave the company in 1922. Georgia Graham, however, danced with the Denishawn Dancers until 1928, sometimes performing in the roles created by Miss St. Denis or her sister. The latter included ''Revolutionary Etude'' and the title role in 'Xochitl.'' According to a fellow Denishawn dancer, Jane Sherman, Georgia Graham stopped the show in that production.         She was a senior member of the Denishawn company on its widespread tour of Asia in 1925-26 and its transcontinental American tour in 1926-27. She also toured with the Denishawn troupe when it became part of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1928. Miss Graham was a dancer in 1931 in the early, all-female Martha Graham Dance Group. In 1933, she appeared in a theatrical production directed by Martha Graham, ''Six Miracle Plays.''         She is survived by her sister.

She was 78 years old and lived in Dallas.         Alma Cunningham, retired vice president of fashion design for the Simplicity Pattern Company, one of the world's leading manufacturers of paper patterns for clothing, died of breast cancer on Oct. 10 at a hospital in Dallas. She was 78 years old and lived in Dallas.         Mrs. Cunningham joined Simplicity at its headquarters in Manhattan in 1960 as editor of its pattern catalogues. She became a vice president in the late 1960's and retired in 1975.         Earlier in her career she had been a fashion editor for Good Housekeeping magazine and a fashion editor of The Dallas Morning News. In 1947 she became the first director of the newly formed regional chapter of the Dallas Fashion Group Inc., a world-wide organization of women in fashion and related industries. She later became a board member of the international Fashion Group organization, a post she maintained until 1982.         She is survived by her mother, Julia Whitley of Dallas; a son, Bruce, of Tokyo; a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.       
        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

Louise Constantine, a former vice president of Aquascutum of London Inc., died of cancer Monday at New York Hospital. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         During her 18 years with the company, Miss Constantine first directed the women's retail division in London. When a store opened in New York, she was in charge of women's clothing. Before joining Aquascutum, she had worked for 19 years at Lord & Taylor, where she became a fashion director.         She is survived by a sister, Koula Fotis of Fort Dodge, Iowa.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Miss Parish's best-known character is Amelia Bedelia, a literal-minded maid who cuts a mistake-prone swath through 11 books (which are illustrated by various artists). When told to help the children plant bulbs, she buys light bulbs. When told to weed the garden, she plants row upon row of big weeds. When her employers, Mr. and Mr. Rogers, ask her to stuff stockings for the neighbors' children, she wonders why they want stockings full of turkey stuffing, but she dutifully obeys. When she is asked to make a spongecake, she snips a sponge into small pieces and drops it into a cake. A Birthday Celebration         Amelia Bedelia has many redeeming qualities, of course, not the least of which is her naivete, and she is loved by her fictional employers. She is also loved by real schoolchildren, many of whom joined in a celebration this year of Amelia Bedelia's 25th birthday, sponsored jointly by Greenwillow Books, Harper & Row and Avon Books, her principal publishers.         Paulette C. Kaufmann, director of children's book marketing at William Morrow & Company, the publisher of Greenwillow, said that hundreds of bookstores and libraries were given mailboxes in which children were invited to submit birthday wishes. ''Since August,'' she said, ''the contents of those mailboxes have been arriving daily - thousands of letters and drawings from children who have read and loved books about Amelia Bedelia.'' From Teacher to Writer         Miss Parish was born in Manning, and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English. She taught school in Oklahoma, Kentucky and, for more than 15 years, at the Dalton School in Manhattan. It was while teaching third grade at the Dalton School that she published her first book, in 1961. Her first Amelia Bedelia book was published two years later.         Her other books include ''The Cats' Burglar,'' ''Dinosaur Time,'' ''The Ghosts of Cougar Island,'' ''Good Hunting Little Indian,'' ''Hermit Dan'' and ''Let's Be Early Settlers With Daniel Boone.''         Miss Parish had a lifelong interest in teaching children to read and study, and she was proud that her books were often used in schools. She returned to Manning in 1972, continuing to write and to speak to library associations and children's education groups.         She is survived by her brother, Stanley, of Manning. A funeral service is to be held today at 2 P.M. at the Presbyterian Church in Manning.       
        Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Though Miss Seefried spent most of her career with the Vienna State Opera, she sang frequently at Covent Garden in London, at La Scala in Milan and at music festivals in Salzburg, Edinburgh, Lucerne and elsewhere. She was also a respected recital and concert singer. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in November 1953, as Susanna in Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' - one of her signature roles.         Miss Seefried was born on Oct. 9, 1919, in Kongetried, a small town in Bavaria. Her father started to give her music lessons when she was a small child, and at the age of 11 she sang the role of Gretel in a performance of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' She studied at the Augsburg Conservatory, and in 1939 joined the Aachen Opera at the invitation of Herbert von Karajan.         She made her Vienna State Opera debut in 1943, as Eva in Wagner's ''Meistersinger,'' and remained with the company until her retirement in 1980.         Miss Seefried made several concert tours of Europe, the United States and the Far East in the 1950's. In 1953, she and her husband, the violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, did a world concert tour together. 'Authority of Style'         From the start of her career, Miss Seefried was praised for the clarity of her voice and her appealing stage presence. Reviewing her Metropolitan Opera debut, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times, ''The shining light of this performance was Miss Seefried, whose beautiful voice and brilliancy and authority of style won her instant recognition.''         During several seasons in the 1950's, she appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra under the direction of Bruno Walter. Reviewing her 1956 performance of ''Et Incarnatus Est'' from the Mozart Mass in C minor, Howard Taubman said in The Times: ''The top of her soprano may not have the brilliance of some other singers, but she is an artist. She sang with warmth and tenderness and with a richness of understanding.''         Though her repertory came to include works by Hindemith, Poulenc, Berg and other modern composers, she was best known for her work in operas by Mozart, including Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni,'' and by Strauss, including Octavian in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and the Composer in ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' She also sang Marzelline in Beethoven's ''Fidelio.''         Miss Seefried recorded most of her operatic repertory and several albums of lieder.         She is survived by her husband and two daughters.
