         Hsieh Ping-ying, a Chinese feminist author known for her autobiographical work, died on Jan. 5 in San Francisco. She was 93.         Miss Hsieh moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970's from Taiwan, to which she had fled from mainland China in 1949.         Miss Hsieh ''pioneered the literary construction of a soldier image for women -- as imaginative as it may have been -- and thereby influenced this kind of literature in China for decades,'' said Charles A. Laughlin,  professor of modern Chinese literature at Yale University.         Her first book was ''War Diary,''  published in 1928 in Shanghai. Dr. Laughlin recalled that, in writing the book, Miss Hsieh accompanied soldiers of the Chinese Nationalist army in 1926 and 1927, when it was trying to bring warlords in the eastern half of China under control and while she was a ''girl soldier'' with propaganda training.         ''At a time when Chinese women were trying to find new modes of identity in the 20th century after having shed the shackles of traditional Chinese feminine identity, there were many different, alternative identities available to them,'' Dr. Laughlin said, ''and I think she was the first to create this very military one.''         A scholar's daughter, Miss Hsieh was born in a village in Hunan province. Before she was 20, she enrolled in the Wuchang Central Political and Military School. The academy trained young women to be uniformed propagandists attached to the regular military.         After her relatively brief military service Miss Hsieh returned to her village and an arranged marriage. In 1940 her book ''Girl Rebel: The Autobiography of Hsieh Pingying'' was published in the United States.         After her marriage ended, Ms. Hsieh was charged with being a Communist and radical and was imprisoned. After her release she studied Chinese literature and worked as a roving writer, editor and teacher. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, she again became a ''girl soldier,'' accompanying Chinese combat troops to the front. Diary entries about her experiences appeared in newspapers and in another book. After World War II she escaped to Taiwan, where she taught and wrote.         Her second husband, Earl Chia,  died in 1988. The couple became American citizens after moving to San Francisco. She is survived by a daughter, Lily Chia Brissman of Nacogdoches, Tex.; two sons, Luke, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Wen, of Ambler, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Catherine M. Rae, a writer who published her first novel at 73, died on Dec. 25 at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 85 and lived in Guilford, Conn.         Shortly after earning her Ph.D. at 65, Ms. Rae wrote her first book, ''Edith Wharton's New York Quartet,'' a work of literary criticism about the writer, who with Eudora Welty served as Ms. Rae's inspiration. The book was published in 1984.         Her first attempt at fiction went unpublished after an editor at St. Martin's Press suggested it was beyond repair and she should write another.         This resulted in ''Brownstone Facade,'' a mystery romance in the style and tone of her beloved Wharton set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1920. It was published in 1988 and called ''a cozy, intelligent diversion'' by The New York Times.         Seven other novels followed, among them ''Flight From Fifth Avenue'' and ''The Hidden Cove'' in 1995 and ''Sunlight on a Broken Column'' in 1997; an eighth is being edited for publication. Often set against the backdrop of fin de siecle New York society, her works frequently centered on a historical event like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Ms. Rae's literary papers -- she was an avid researcher -- will be donated to the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1931. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1935, a master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College in 1970 and a Ph.D. in English literature from Denver University in 1979.         Ms. Rae's husband, Gene, died on Nov. 13. She is survived by a son, David, of Ridgewood, N.J.; three daughters, Lucy Rae Ricciardi of Greenwich, Conn., Catherine Rae Reed of Littleton, Colo., and Mary Louise Rae Arnold of Fort Worth, and eight grandchildren.       
         Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the company, died on Dec. 19 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.         Her title for many years was simply that of general manager, but Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight and was unknown to the general ballet going public. A woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.         Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein described her role in ''Thirty Years,'' his history of the City Ballet, ''at once labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ''proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and impossible.''         Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo before she moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an assistant editor at John Bernard Myers's literary journal View and an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that introduced her to the world of poets, artists and intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940's.         It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart, where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired formally in 1985, working first as an assistant to Frances Hawkins, the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who as chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948 extended a crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln Center on terms agreeable to the ballet company and to City Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City Ballet.         Ms. Cage was also a practitioner and proponent of tai chi, the Chinese exercise system. She collaborated with her husband, the writer Edward Maisel, on ''Tai Chi for Health.''         She is survived by her husband.       
         Hazel Wolf, an ardent environmentalist whose life spanned the 20th century and whose causes encompassed the era's social turmoil, died in Port Angeles, Wash., on Wednesday. She was 101 and lived in Seattle.         Since the early 1960's Ms. Wolf was a leader in the Audubon Society, serving as secretary of the Seattle chapter for 37 years and helping to establish 21 of the 26 Audubon chapters in Washington. She was also active in the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs, as its one-time president and as editor of its newsletter until her death.         Born in the 19th century, Ms. Wolf had long spoken of wanting to witness the 21st. She told the oral historian Studs Terkel, who profiled her in his 1995 book ''Coming of Age,'' that she intended to live until the year 2000. ''Then I'm going,'' she said.         Especially in the Seattle region, but also beyond, she was elder stateswoman in a community of intersecting social causes, recognized by the Association of Biologists and Ecologists of Nicaragua for conservation work there, by the Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility with their Paul Beeson Peace Award, by the National Audubon Society with its medal of excellence and last year by Seattle with its Spirit of America Award.         But long before the environmental movement blossomed, providing a cause that made her celebrated in her later years, Ms. Wolf was steeped in struggles over human rights, communism, labor issues, peace, feminism and immigration.         Hazel Anna Cummings Anderson was born on March 10, 1898, in Victoria, British Columbia. Her father was Canadian and her mother was American. After separating from her first husband, Edward Dalziel, she moved to the United States in 1923 with her daughter, finding work as a legal secretary, her lifelong career.         She joined the Communist Party during the Depression, attracted by its support for social welfare programs like food subsidies, unemployment aid and social security.         Her first party meeting, she recalled in a speech years later, was at a home where the local sheriff was at that moment trying to evict a family. ''I joined in what was occurring,'' she said. ''As the sheriff's men brought the furniture out to pile it on the sidewalk, the rest of us picked it up and took it into the house by the back door. This went on for quite a while until the sheriff and his men, who were not very enthusiastic in the first place, left in despair and frustration.''         Ms. Wolf said she lost interest in the party during World War II, as the wartime boom made issues of economic security less compelling to her. But years after she left the party, the government tried to expel her, starting a personal and legal struggle that shaped her life. That fight lasted 15 years, as McCarthyism rose and fell. She once joked that a lawyer she worked for at the time spent so much effort on her case that it was not clear who was working for whom.         The experience led her into advocacy for the rights of immigrants, a cause she never gave up. ''The foreign born were the earliest victims of the McCarthy witch hunt,'' she said 10 years ago in a talk to a high school class. ''They still have a hard and uncertain life.''         In that lecture, as on many other occasions, Ms. Wolf recounted being thrown in jail briefly in 1958, charged with sedition though she had left the Communist Party 13 years before. She told the two other women in her jail cell that she had been accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by violent means. ''What a wonderful idea,'' one of her fellow prisoners said.         ''I never did try to overthrow the government, or if I did, I didn't do a very good job,'' Ms. Wolf said.         But her associates said she never gave up trying to overthrow whatever she saw as unjust, whether it was the behavior of big corporations or the policies of the United States in Nicaragua. Her reputation grew, and she became a frequent public speaker (many of her speeches can be found on the World Wide Web at members.tripod.com/HazelWolf). Only a broken hip prevented her from joining the protests by unions and environmentalists in Seattle during the recent meeting of the World Trade Organization, said Brock Evans, president of the Western Outdoor Clubs.         ''One of her major causes was always for labor to join with environmentalists,'' he said. Another was for environmentalists to include Native Americans, blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups in their movement.         ''People gang up to protect all kinds of things -- civil liberties, freedom of speech,'' Ms. Wolf once wrote. ''It's in our genes to gang up. Anytime we want anything, we gang up.''         Summing up her many causes, she told the American Immigration Lawyers Association last year, ''We lost most of the battles but we won the war in all of them.''         She told them insouciantly that when she finally became an American citizen in 1974, after taking the oath and forswearing allegiance to foreign potentates, she went to a bar to celebrate with friends. ''I proposed the following toast: 'To hell with Queen Elizabeth and to hell with Richard Nixon, too.' ''         She is survived by her daughter, Nydia Levick of Port Angeles, five grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and four great-great grandchildren. Her second marriage, to Herbert Wolf, also ended in divorce.         Ms. Wolf was already at most people's retirement age when a friend persuaded her to join the Audubon Society in the early 1960's. It was the era when Rachel Carson was warning that pesticides and the eradication of habitats were threatening the earth with a silent spring with no song birds, but more than that book or her friend's arm-twisting, it was bird-watching (specifically, observing a brown creeper grubbing in the woods) that sparked her deep involvement with Audubon. For decades more, she continued to go to the woods for inspiration and to urge others along the environmental path.         But she spiced her advocacy with a dollop of salt. In a speech last year on saving the endangered salmon of the Pacific Northwest, she reminded her Seattle University audience of the first reason to do so: the fish are ''good to eat.''         And in a speech on sustainable forestry practices in 1998, she said her goal was not, as she quoted the poet, to ''spare that tree, cut not a single bough,'' but rather to make sure there would always be forests for wild creatures and to provide homes, furniture, paper and ''probably even skateboards.''       
         Mary Cantwell, who wrote essays, books and editorials for The New York Times, many about the changing public and private lives of women in America, died yesterday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Margaret Lescher of Riverdale, the Bronx.         As a member of The Times editorial board for 16 years, Ms. Cantwell wrote often about issues affecting women. A notable one concerned ''the squeal rule,'' the label she coined for a 1982 Reagan administration proposal to forbid giving contraceptives to teenagers unless their parents were informed. Such a rule, she wrote, would discourage effective contraception and increase teenage pregnancies.         ''Thanks to the coinage,'' the columnist William Safire later wrote, ''the battle is being won by the anti-squeal forces.''         Apart from unsigned editorials, Ms. Cantwell wrote personal observations for The Times and elsewhere about the pride and pain brought by three decades of transformation in the lives of women, particularly in the spheres of work, marriage and divorce, and parenthood.         Why could she not cry about a sick calico cat, she wondered in a ''Close to Home'' column in 1990. One reason, she realized, is that ''Women were reputed to weep on the job.''         ''Not this woman. No way I was going to let somebody know I'd been gotten at; no way I was going to give somebody that satisfaction.''         On divorce, she gave voice to many readers' feelings in a ''Hers'' column in The Times in 1980, describing the day she and her former husband watched their older daughter's high school graduation: ''There on stage is someone who is half he, half she; their blood, their genes. They created somebody: the woman is awed. As long as there is a she, the woman thinks, there is an us.''         Starting in her childhood in Bristol, R.I., Ms. Cantwell was an acute observer of the era in which she lived.         ''I never wanted to be anything but a writer,'' she once said, ''but I saw no hope, had no expectations. I feel, perhaps wrongly, that I grew up in an era when writing was very much a boys' club. It took a brave woman, braver than I, to write books.''         Still, she wrote three. The first, ''American Girl'' (Random House, 1992), was a love letter to Bristol. A Times reader ''wrote in and said there is a small town in the background of everything I ever wrote, so why didn't I write about that small town,'' she said. And so she did, about a three-generation household in a town where the oldest resident carried a gold-headed cane to lead the Fourth of July parade.         After ''American Girl,'' her readers wrote in again. Now they wanted to know what happened to that girl. ''New York was what happened to that girl,'' Ms. Cantwell said, explaining how she came to write ''Manhattan, When I Was Young'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1995). It described her life in the prosperous postwar years, the heyday of the Stork Club and Bonwit Teller.         In her third book, ''Speaking With Strangers'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), she talked about pushing herself to travel, after the end of her marriage to Robert Lescher, a literary agent.  She also described an on-again-off-again affair with a celebrated Southern writer she identified only as ''the balding man,'' a womanizer who dropped her for someone younger.         She said that she had not wanted to distract readers by naming him. Later, after many critics and some readers had guessed, she acknowledged him to be James Dickey.         After Ms. Cantwell graduated from Connecticut College in 1953, she landed a job in New York as a copywriter at Mademoiselle magazine, where she worked during the next 23 years, including 9 as managing editor and features editor.         In 1980, she was invited to be one of the early guest writers of the Hers column in The Times. Later that year, she joined the Times editorial board, commenting on social policy issues like smoking, abortion and assisted suicide, and on whimsical topics such as the world as seen from the M10 bus.         In 1981, she wrote ''Dear Abby,'' a widely quoted editorial about Evangeline Gouletas-Carey, the new wife of Hugh L. Carey, the governor of New York. Before the wedding, Mrs. Gouletas-Carey described herself as a widow. But her former husband turned up alive and well, and so did two other former husbands she had not mentioned.         ''Dear Abby'' read as if it were a letter to the advice columnist from Mrs. Gouletas-Carey. ''What I want to know is, Abby, can you think of a way I might have avoided all this fuss?'' It was signed, ''Wondering.''         She matured as a writer, she said, after she discovered the novelist Jean Rhys. ''That was a writer I could best emulate,'' she said last year. ''That was a life and sensibility I understood.''         She was struck by one Rhys observation: ''If I stop writing my life will have been an abject failure,'' Rhys wrote in ''Smile, Please,'' an autobiographical memoir. ''I will not have earned death.''         Ms. Cantwell reflected on that in a 1980 ''Hers'' column. ''To earn one's death,'' she wrote, ''I think of it as a kind of parlor game. How, I shall ask my friends, would you like to earn your deaths? And how would I like to earn mine? The question is strangely liberating, implying as it does action, energy, choice. In fact, it has an unexpectedly American ring: death as First Prize. I like it -- it makes the nights less frightening.''         Besides Margaret Lescher, she is survived by another daughter, Katherine Lescher of Sydney, Australia;  her mother, Mary G. Cantwell of Bristol; a sister, Diana Nickerson of Pittsburgh; and a granddaughter.       
         Jane Nickerson Steinberg, a former food editor of The New York Times, died Sunday at a hospital in White Sulphur Springs, Mont. She was 83.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said a son, John R. Steinberg.         As Jane Nickerson, she was food editor of The Times from 1942 to 1957, when she moved to Lakeland, Fla. She was food editor of The Ledger in Lakeland from 1973 to 1988, her son said. In 1973, she published ''Jane Nickerson's Florida Cookbook.''         Mrs. Steinberg was born on May 19, 1916, in Manhattan. She worked for The Saturday Evening Post and Ladies Home Journal before joining The Times.         Her marriage to Alexander Francis Steinberg ended in divorce in 1972. Besides their son John, of Lakeland, she is survived by their two other sons, Josiah Bartlett Steinberg of Lakeland and Marc Steinberg of White Sulphur Springs; their daughter, Alexandra Kaghan Macaluso of Reston, Va.; and four grandchildren.       
         Katharine Washburn, an essayist, editor, anthologist and translator whose legacy includes a cornucopia of verse from the dawn of civilization to the present, died Wednesday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 57.         The apparent cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Ms. Washburn was editor, with John S. Major, of ''World Poetry: An Anthology of Verse From Antiquity to Our Time'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), an updated and expanded version of Mark Van Doren's 1928 ''Anthology of World Poetry.''         At 1,338 pages, including the index, the volume contains 1,600 poems ranging over more than 4,000 years, from ancient Sumer and Egypt to the late 20th century. The editors organized it in eight chronological parts from the Bronze Age forward, with each section subdivided by language.         Most of the poems were translated into English for the anthology by other poets. Its English-language verse sampled the best from Chaucer to the present.         Ms. Washburn herself translated poetry from classical and modern European languages. Among her earlier work was a 1986 translation from the German of poems by Paul Celan (North Point, 1986). At her death, she was working on a novel, ''The Translator's Apology.''         She was co-editor of ''Dumbing Down: Essays on the Strip Mining of American Culture'' (Norton, 1996). It presented the worried views of observers from many vantage points of the present state of American life, art and thought.         She co-edited ''Tongues of Angels, Tongues of Man: A Book of Sermons'' (Doubleday, 1999). It was filled with the ringing words of preachers addressing the vagaries of the world, from the Sermon on the Mount to Savonarola's contempt for the vanities of Renaissance Florence to the anti-Nazi defiance of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer.         Ms. Washburn was a graduate of Pembroke-Brown University and earned an M.A. at Columbia University, where she also received a Ph.D. in classic Greek. In the 1980's she was on the editorial staff of the Book-of-the-Month Club, and her articles appeared in The New York Times Book Review, Partisan Review, Parnassus and New Republic, among others.         She is survived by her husband, Sherwood; her parents, Calman Winegarden of Toledo, Ohio, and Margaret Winegarden of Rochester; a sister, Mary Hoyle of San Francisco; and three sons, Andrew, Michael and Will, of Brooklyn.       
         Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, an author whose ability to recreate the sensibilities of a child informed many well-loved books she wrote for young readers, died on March 1 at her home in Washington. She was 86.         Beni Montresor illustrated Mrs. de Regniers's ''May I Bring a Friend?'' (1972) and won the Caldecott Medal for the pictures that accompany the story of a boy who politely asks a king and queen for permission before bringing his animal friends along when he is asked to visit. Mrs. de Regniers's other books included ''A Little House of Your Own'' (1954), illustrated by Irene Haas, and ''Little Sister and the Month Brothers'' (1975), illustrated by Margot Tomes.         ''What Can You Do With a Shoe?,'' an engaging conversation between two children, was illustrated by Maurice Sendak in 1955 using two colors. It was republished in 1997 with full-color illustrations by Mr. Sendak.         Mrs. de Regniers was born in Lafayette, Ind., and raised in nearby Crawfordsville, a place where, she wrote, a child could ''gather violets, live in a tree, walk in the woods -- be.'' She earned degrees from the University of Chicago and the Winnetka Graduate Teachers College.         She was a social worker and a dancer and during World War II a welfare officer with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. For 11 years she was director of educational materials for the American Heart Association before becoming the founding editor of Scholastic's Lucky Book Club in 1961. She retired from that position in 1981.         In an essay Mrs. de Regniers explained the deceptively simple style of her children's books, saying that ''a book for young people that honestly has its roots in the author's feelings as a child is not likely to seem old-fashioned or out of date.''         Under the pseudonym Tamara Kitt (Tammy and Mara were her cats' names), Mrs. de Regniers also wrote a series of mass-market paperbacks, including ''Jake'' and ''Sam and the Impossible Thing.''         She was married to Francis de Regniers, who worked as a manager  for Air France, and they lived in New York until his death in 1992. She later moved to Washington to be near her sister, Lillian Goldman of Washington, who survives her.         When schoolchildren asked if she had children of her own, Mrs. de Regniers explained that she had vivid memories of her childhood. ''I remember 'way back,'' she would say, ''even before I was 2 years old,'' adding that ''almost everything I write relates in some way to these early years. What was important to me then is important to me now.         ''That is why, even though I have no children of my own, I think it is O.K. for me to write books that children will read or have read to them.''       
         Frances Gray Patton, a writer whose short stories appeared in The New Yorker through four decades and whose works included the popular 1954 novel ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. She was 94 and lived in Durham.         Ms. Potter's finely crafted stories offered glimpses into Durham society in the mid-20th century, a world she knew well as a Duke faculty wife.         Her first published work, ''A Piece of Bread,'' the story of a Southern girl's encounter with a prison chain gang, won a Kenyon Review prize and was included among the 1945 ''O. Henry Memorial Award Prize Stories.''         After that, The New Yorker began publishing Ms. Patton's stories, 30 in the next 10 years. Others appeared in magazines like Colliers, Harper's, The Saturday Review of Literature and McCall's. Her first book, ''The Finer Things of Life'' (1951), a collection culled mostly from works that appeared in The New Yorker, earned praise from critics.         Three years later, Ms. Patton's first novel, ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' was published. Developed from her story ''The Terrible Miss Dove,'' first published in Ladies' Home Journal, the work chronicled the life of a strict but beloved geography teacher in a small American town whose sudden illness shocks the community.         Writing in The New York Times, Charles Poore described the work as ''ruthlessly sentimental'' and ''a cheerful mixture of 'Goodbye Mr. Chips' and 'Mary Poppins,' with touches of the rigorous way to salvation from 'Life With Father.' ''         The novel was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and the movie rights were sold to 20th Century Fox, which turned the story into a popular film starring Jennifer Jones.         In 1955, Ms. Patton published ''A Piece of Luck,'' a second collection of stories, set mostly in suburbia, that explored the private worlds of children and women. A third collection, ''28 Stories,'' was published in 1969.         Frances MacRae Gray was born in Raleigh, N.C., where her father was editor of The Raleigh Times. Her mother had been the first woman to enroll at the University of North Carolina.         Ms. Patton became a writer by way of the theater. After high school, she attended Trinity College, now Duke University, before enrolling at the University of North Carolina, where she held a fellowship as a playwright and was active in the Carolina Playmakers. Over the years, she taught creative writing at both universities.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of San Francisco; two daughters, Mary Bogdonoff of Manhattan and Susannah Patton of Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Hart, the editor of two highly praised books of song lyrics by her brother-in-law, Lorenz Hart, of Rodgers and Hart fame, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Ontario, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Rancho Mirage, Calif.         Mrs. Hart was the widow of Lorenz Hart's brother, Theodore, a comedian. She and Robert Kimball edited ''The Complete Lyrics of Lorenz Hart'' (Knopf, 1986), containing some 670 of the songs Lorenz Hart wrote before his death in 1943.         The book was lauded in a review by the cabaret singer Bobby Short in The New York Times Book Review. He said Mrs. Hart ''took on the herculean task of compiling Larry Hart's historic works a decade ago'' for her other book, ''Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' which Mr. Short said was ''an admirable effort on its own, but, as it turns out, it was merely the tip of the iceberg.''         Mr. Short wrote that Mrs. Hart and Mr. Kimball, an expert on the musical theater, ''left no stone unturned in their search for every lyric ascribed to Hart,'' and ''what has been achieved here is something monumental.''         Mrs. Hart edited ''Thou Swell, Thou Witty'' (Da Capo, 1976) and wrote a memoir included in the book. One critic said that work was ''indispensable for anyone interested in Hart, which is to say anyone interested in Broadway musical comedy, and Mrs. Hart's words are honest, unpretentious and affecting.''         Her son, also named Lorenz, said Friday that ''Thou Swell, Thou Witty'' had played a critical role in the growth of the popularity of Rodgers and Hart songs that he said had taken place since then. The best-known Rodgers and Hart songs include ''The Lady Is a Tramp,'' ''Manhattan'' and ''Blue Moon.''         Mrs. Hart, the former Dorothy Lubow, was born in Brooklyn. She left school at 16 and became a dancer for a time. Then she spent years as a writer and columnist for show-business fan magazines. She married her husband in 1938. He died in 1971.         Besides her son, of Arlington, Va., she is survived by a granddaughter.       
         Jean E. Karl, who established the publishing imprint Atheneum Books for Young Readers in 1961 and led it until she retired in 1985, died on Thursday at a hospice in Lancaster, Pa. She was 72.         Ms. Karl, who continued to edit books until recently, also wrote extensively, including nonfiction, fiction and science-fiction novels, mostly for children, under her own name, and other science fiction as R. W. Munson (her grandmother's name).         She left no immediate survivors.         The author E. L. Konigsburg has described Ms. Karl as her ''forever editor.'' As a young woman Ms. Konigsburg submitted two manuscripts to Ms. Karl, who published both in 1967. ''The Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler'' won the Newbery Medal the next year, while ''Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth'' was named a Newbery Honor book. Thirty years and 15 books later, ''The View From Saturday'' also won a Newbery Medal for Ms. Konigsburg.         Ms. Karl oversaw or edited Newbery Medal books by Robert C. O'Brien, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, Cynthia Voigt and Maia Wojciechowska.         She edited two Caldecott Medal books, ''May I Bring a Friend?,'' by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, illustrated by Beni Montresor, and ''A Story, a Story,'' by Gail E. Haley, as well as Ursula K. LeGuin's ''Farthest Shore,'' which won a National Book Award. Ms. Karl's books also won eight Edgar Awards. She was also the founder of Aladdin Paperbacks.         Ms. Karl was born and brought up in Chicago. She graduated from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio.         She began working in the editorial department of Scott, Foresman in Chicago. In 1956 she moved to New York to be editor of children's books at Abingdon Press, the publishing house of the Methodist Church, and remained there until she was recruited by Alfred Knopf Jr. to start the children's department at Atheneum. Atheneum is now a children's imprint at Simon & Schuster.         The story goes that when an Atheneum executive called her the ''juvenile editor,'' she addressed him as  ''senile editor,'' adding sharply that ''good children's books are never juvenile.''       
         Betsy Dworkin, a former senior lecturer in social policy and administration at the University of London's Chelsea and University colleges, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She would have been 67 today.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Ronald Dworkin.         Mrs. Dworkin was born in Manhattan to Walter and Adelaide Ross.         She received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1955 from Radcliffe College, where she studied American history and literature, and she was a Fulbright Scholar in Paris. She received a master's degree in the history of fine arts in 1957 from Harvard.         She went on to be a writer on the staff of the Metropolitan Museum, an associate editor of Art News and managing editor of a sister publication, the quarterly Portfolio. In 1962, she moved to New Haven, where she helped run a poverty program in the public school system.         In 1969, she moved to Britain, where in 1972 she received a second master's degree, this one in social policy, from the London School of Economics. From 1972 to 1989 she taught at Chelsea and University colleges.         In addition to her husband, Professor Ronald Dworkin, who teaches at New York University and at the University of London's University College, she is survived by a son, Anthony of London; and a daughter, Jennifer Dworkin of Manhattan.       
         Evelyn Graham Irons, a war correspondent who had a romance with the Bloomsbury novelist and poet Vita Sackville-West, died April 3 at her home in Brewster, N.Y. She was two months short of her 100th birthday.         Ms. Irons was a 30-year-old editor of the women's page of The Daily Mail in London when she met Sackville-West in 1931. She had gone to interview the 38-year-old writer at her home, Sissinghurst Castle, renowned for its famous gardens, which Sackville-West spent much of her life designing and tending.         The romance was tangled. Sackville-West had already begun her enduring relationship with Violet Trefusis, the daughter of Alice Keppel, Edward VII's mistress. And Ms. Irons was romantically involved at the time with Olive Rinder, who soon also fell in love with Sackville-West.         Victoria Glendenning wrote in her 1983 biography, ''Vita: The Life of Vita Sackville-West,'' that by January 1932, the three women were in a menage a trois that ended later that year when Ms. Irons met and fell in love with another woman, Joy McSweeney. Ms. McSweeney remained her companion until she died in the 1980's.         The love poems dated 1931 in Vita Sackville-West's ''Collected Poems'' are addressed to Ms. Irons, although Ms. Glendenning notes that ''the more erotic ones'' were never published. Ms. Irons and Sackville-West remained close friends and corresponded warmly until Sackville-West's death in 1962.         Evelyn Irons was born in Glasgow on June 17, 1900. After graduating from Somerville College, Oxford, she began working as a journalist for The Daily Mail, then The Evening Standard. At the outbreak of World War II, The Standard made her a war correspondent. Suspecting that British commanders would not welcome a woman at their headquarters, she accredited herself to the First French Army and crossed the Rhine with Charles de Gaulle and accompanied French troops through Germany and Austria.         She is believed to be the first female war correspondent to reach Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden and was the first to win the Croix de Guerre.         Ms. Irons moved to New York in 1952. In 1954, she rode into Guatemala on a mule during a revolution there, getting to the action and filing her dispatches well ahead of her colleagues. She became the New York bureau chief for The Sunday Times of London at the end of the 1950's.         No immediate family members survive her.       
         Dina Abramowicz, the longtime librarian at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research whose firsthand and encyclopedic knowledge of the lost Yiddish world of Eastern Europe made her a treasured resource for hundreds of scholars and writers for more than half a century, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Abramowicz had a formidable memory, and not only for those who peopled her cherished birthplace, Vilna, Lithuania, the great center of Yiddish culture now known as Vilnius, where the YIVO collection originated.         Her mind was a mental card catalog for hundreds of rare and obscure books and historical materials in the dusty YIVO stacks. And she hunted them down for scholars like Irving Howe and novelists like Leon Uris as well as for thousands of ordinary people trying to research their family histories.         When George F. Kennan, the diplomat and historian, was looking for material one day on a 19th century convert to Christianity, she led him not only to the entry in the library's precious Russian-Jewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in Yiddish about Jewish apostates.         ''This is the sort of book that Dina knew off the top of her head,'' said Zachary Baker, who succeeded Ms. Abramowicz as YIVO's head librarian and now is curator of Judaica at Stanford University's library.         Her friend Esther Hautzig, a Manhattan book editor and writer who grew up in Vilna, said of her, ''No computer on earth can store the information she had in her brain because she lived through it.'' She remembers Ms. Abramowicz as the librarian who provided her with her first library card.         Almost daily, Ms. Abramowicz received inquiries from journalists and writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of Yiddish. They relied on Ms. Abramowicz as their authority for the transliterated spelling of words like bobe (grandmother) and yichus (pedigree).         Though less than five feet tall and dainty in an Old World way, Ms. Abramowicz could be flintlike in her insistence upon historical and linguistic accuracy. When a letter to The New York Times stated that the word ''Holocaust'' was first used in the Dec. 24, 1942, daily bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, she made sure to write a corrective letter. The agency's bulletin, she pointed out, used a term translatable as atrocities, not Holocaust, and the probable first use of Holocaust to refer to the mass slaughter of Jews was from the May 14, 1943, Polish daily Nowy Dzien, which used the Polish word for holocaust, calopalenie, to describe the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto.         Her life, sorrowful as parts of it were, had a striking symmetry, from Vilna to the New York home of the archives rescued from Vilna.         Vilna was fiercely loved by its Jewish inhabitants as the ''Jerusalem of Lithuania,'' a city of writers like Chaim Grade and Abraham Sutzkever. Ms. Abramowicz was the librarian first of Vilna's Jewish children's library and then, after the Nazis herded Jews into ghettos, of the ghetto library. When she came to New York in 1946, she soon went to work for the transplanted version of one of Vilna's most important institutions, the YIVO library, many of whose thousands of books and artifacts had been smuggled out by a ragtag band of slave laborers and partisans known as the paper brigade.         She was YIVO's head librarian for 25 years, until 1987; then in her late 70's, she was eased off to work as research librarian, a position she held until her death.         The daughter of teachers, Ms. Abramowicz was born in 1909, when Vilna was part of the czar's empire; it was to live under Polish, Lithuanian, German and Soviet Russian governments before she left. She grew up speaking Russian, but when the Germans occupied Vilna during World War I, they allowed Jews to start their own schools, as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy, and Dina's parents sent her to Yiddish-language elementary and high schools.         After studying Polish literature in university, she went to work for her first library, the Kinderbibliotek. She also became a member of YIVO, the  acronym for the Yiddish name of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, an organization founded in 1925. It soon became a repository of manuscripts of Sholem Aleichem and Biaklik, records of Jewish communal governments and other historical documents as well as thousands of books.         When the Germans invaded in World War II and crammed Vilna's 56,000 Jews into neighborhood ghettos, Herman Kruk, a librarian, tried to maintain an oasis of normality in the madness by setting up a library, and he asked Ms. Abramowicz to staff it.         ''How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?'' she remembered asking a fellow librarian.         ''Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?'' was the answer she remembered getting.         In its first year, the library circulated 100,000 books to its starving, brutalized readers, mostly, it turned out, escapist fiction.         In September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated. Ms. Abramowicz's mother was dispatched to Treblinka, where she was killed; Ms. Abramowicz to a labor camp. By a stroke of fortune, the door on the cattle train opened on the Vilna platform and she simply walked off. She wound up in a less rigorous camp, one for workers who processed fur for the German army's winter coats. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper.         After the war, she found her father in New York, where he had traveled just before the war broke out in September 1939. She soon met Max Weinreich, a surviving YIVO founder, and joined him in reconstituting the YIVO collection in New York.         Beyond helping scholars who visited the Vanderbilt mansion that for years housed YIVO and its new home on West 16th Street, Ms. Abramowicz seemed to take on the search for roots as a personal compulsion.         ''At certain periods of your life, you start to want to find out what happened to your parents,'' she said once. ''I think it is the survival instinct of a people trying to find out who they are.''         Other than two nephews and a niece, Ms. Abramowicz left no survivors. But her name endures in dozens of acknowledgments by the authors whose research she shepherded. In his tribute in ''The World of Our Fathers,'' the classic work about the immigrant Jews of New York,  Mr. Howe thanked YIVO for making the book possible, ''especially its indefatigable and splendid librarian, Dina Abramowicz.''       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Barbara T. Christian, a professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley and a pioneer of contemporary American literary feminism, died on June 25 at her home in Berkeley. She was 56.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia McBroom, a university spokeswoman.         The author and editor of several books and 100 articles and reviews, Ms. Christian was best known for her landmark study ''Black Women Novelists: The Development of a Tradition.'' It appeared in 1980 amid a general rediscovery of the work of such writers as Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and the rise to prominence of several younger authors, including Toni Morrison and Alice Walker.         Ms. Christian was a leading critical presence in the growing debates over the relationship among race, class and gender. Her widely cited article ''The Race for Theory'' challenged the increasing domination of African-American literary study by those who were primarily interested in theory rather than in writers and their work.         Born in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Ms. Christian entered Marquette University in Wisconsin at the age of 15. After she graduated cum laude in 1963, her family urged her to study medicine, but she instead chose graduate study at Columbia University, from which she received a doctorate in contemporary British and American literature in 1970. During her graduate studies, she also taught at the City College of the City University of New York.         In 1971, she was appointed assistant professor at Berkeley. A year later, she was instrumental in the establishment of the department of African-American studies, where she taught until her death. She was chairwoman of the department from 1978 until 1983. She led Berkeley's new doctoral program in ethnic studies from 1986 to 1989.         In 1978, she became the first African-American woman to be granted tenure at Berkeley. In 1986, she became the first to be promoted to full professor. In 1991, she won the university's Distinguished Teaching Award, the first African-American to do so. This year, she received the Berkeley Citation ''for distinguished achievement and for notable service to the university.''         In a letter supporting her nomination, Henry Louis Gates Jr. of Harvard University wrote that Ms. Christian ''has emerged as the senior figure among African-American feminists.'' Arnold Rampersad of Stanford University called her ''a major shaper and guide in the general area where the subjects of literature, race and feminism meet.''         Ms. Christian's marriage to David Henderson, a poet and a biographer of Jimi Hendrix, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Najuma Ide Christian of Berkeley; her parents, Judge Alphonso A. and Ruth Christian of St. Thomas; three sisters, Dr. Cora Christian of St. Croix, Reubina Gomez of St. Thomas and Alicia Wells of Philadelphia; two brothers, Alphonso Christian of Washington and Delano Christian of San Francisco; and a stepson, Imetai Malik Henderson of New York.       
         Emily Maxwell, the wife of the author and New Yorker editor William Maxwell, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her daughter Kate Maxwell said.         Mrs. Maxwell published short articles and reminiscences in The New Yorker, and from 1957 to 1965, she wrote year-end reviews of children's books for the magazine's Christmas list. She was also a painter.         Mr. Maxwell dedicated a number of his books to his wife. One of them, ''The Old Man at the Railroad Crossing and Other Tales'' (1957), is a collection of fables he wrote for her, some as bedtime stories when she couldn't sleep, and others as Christmas gifts for the family.         In addition to her daughter Kate, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; another daughter, Brookie Maxwell, also of Manhattan; a grandson; and two brothers, Robert Noyes of Portland, Ore., and H. F. Noyes of Athens, Greece.       
         Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to the furs she designed for the music world's most tireless clotheshorses, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal. She was 37.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.         For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was almost unknown in the fashion world, Ms. Battle had a large following. Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make trousers for him in black sheared mink.         And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's ''Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella Versace, it was Ms. Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige, who had on a turquoise fur chubby.         Ms. Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense, she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had relatives in North Carolina, and Ms. Battle, who was part Tuscarora Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.         After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Ms. Battle started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.         ''When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines, they'd say to the stylists, 'I'm wearing my own coat,' '' recalled her sister. They meant, of course, Ms. Battle's furs. She also created coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made identical styles for their wives and children.         Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne, burgundy and green, projected a high urban style -- what Mr. Talley called ''a ghetto fabulousness'' -- that not only appealed to Ms. Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked the 1970's in fashion. She was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of reviving that era.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother, Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.       
         Sally Kovalchick, editor in chief of Workman Publishing Company, who supervised the publication of some notable best-selling books, died on Saturday at her home in Southampton, N.Y. She was 61.         The cause apparently was a heart attack, a company statement said.         Ms. Kovalchick spent 26 years at Workman, was a senior editor and then became editor in chief several years ago. She oversaw the publication of about 15 books that became best sellers by the company's count, including ''The Official Preppy Handbook.''         ''She quietly gave birth to enormous best sellers that achieved cult status,'' said Peter Workman, the company's chief executive. ''She had a great publishing gut'' -- an instinct for what books would be successful, he said. ''Her particular talent was to make books better, to get the most out of authors and their subjects.''         Ms. Kovalchick specialized in humorous books. In a 1990 interview she said: ''Parodies are always good. We look for a subject, and for the joke. Our authors usually submit complete manuscripts. Once in a while we have a funny idea but can't figure out what to do with it. The hard part is that everyone copies us.''         Mr. Workman said it was Ms. Kovalchick who nurtured ''The Official Preppy Handbook,'' a 224-page work of humor, into being. Published in 1980, the book was the joint handiwork of four preppies in their mid-20's who were all Ivy League college graduates: Jonathan Roberts, Lisa Birnbach, Carol McD. Wallace and Mason Wiley. A tongue-in-cheek guidebook to ''living the elite and proper life of Prep,'' the book was true enough and funny enough to reach the top of what was then called The New York Times's trade paperback best-seller list of Jan. 4, 1981, for the second successive week and remain on the list for 65 weeks all told.         Ms. Kovalchick also oversaw the publication of ''Cat'' (1975), a best-selling collection of cartoons of cats by B. Kliban. One ''Cat'' cartoon  pictured a guitar-playing feline singing: ''Love to eat them mousies. Mousies what I love to eat. Bite they little heads off . . . nibble on they tiny feet.'' Within a few years, the Kliban cats began appearing on calendars, greeting cards and other products, becoming a $50 million industry in the mid-1980's. Workman published most of the 10 Kliban books.         Another best-selling book ushered into print by Ms. Kovalchick was ''The Dieter's Guide to Weight Loss During Sex'' (1978), by Richard Smith.         The publishing projects she supervised in her later years included ''1001 Ways to Reward Employees'' (1994) by Bob Nelson. Workman says more than a million copies of it have been sold.         Another later project of hers was the Brain Quest series of question-and-answer games in card deck form for children through seventh grade.         Ms. Kovalchick was born in Indiana, Pa., and graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.         She is survived by two sisters, Becky Rankin of Monroeville, Pa. and Millie Glinsky of Indiana, Pa.;  and a brother, Joseph, also of Indiana.       
         Helene Ritzerfeld, an internationally known executive of a major German publishing house, Suhrkamp Verlag, died on July 22 at her office desk in Frankfurt. She was 86 and lived in Frankfurt.         The cause was a heart attack, said a colleague, Dr. Petra Christina Hardt.         At her death, Frau Ritzerfeld, as she was known, was the longtime head of the Suhrkamp department handling what are called, in American publishing, subsidiary rights. She was best known for her work in foreign rights -- that is, the selling to non-German publishers of the rights to publish books that had been published by Suhrkamp.         Drenka Willen, a senior editor at Harcourt Brace, said Frau Ritzerfeld was influential in her field because ''for one thing, Suhrkamp publishes high-quality books, so she sold the rights to books of great consequence.''         ''She was a hard bargainer,'' she said. ''She was tough but fair.''         Lindsay Waters, the Harvard University Press's executive editor for the humanities, said of Frau Ritzerfeld's passing, ''This is the end of an era, as anyone who ever attended the Frankfurt Book Fair will be more than happy to testify.'' The fair is an international publishing event.         ''The great Walter Benjamin project we have going at the Harvard University Press -- some 3,000 pages -- was made possible by her,'' he said. ''She helped me through so many complicated matters.''         Benjamin (1892-1940) was a versatile German man of letters known for his literary criticism and his surrealist nonfiction prose. Since the late 1980's, the Harvard University Press has been publishing English translations of Benjamin's works.         Helene Ritzerfeld was born in Cologne, Germany, and graduated from a secondary school there, the Kaiserin-Augusta-Schule, where she specialized in Latin and mathematics.         During World War II, she lived in Norway and Berlin. After the war, she worked for a time in the spa city of Wiesbaden, Germany, for the United States occupation government. Her survivors include a number of nieces, nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews.         Ms. Willen said Frau Ritzerfeld was on excellent terms with all of Suhrkamp's major writers, including Max Frisch, the Swiss novelist, and Uwe Johnson, the German author and editor.         She worked for Suhrkamp for half a century. The publishing house's head, Dr. Siegfried Unseld, wrote after her death, ''Her commitment to spreading German literature in other languages is legendary.'' She was also at home in other literary cultures and translated works by George Bernard Shaw, T.S. Eliot and Soren Kierkegaard.         A noted German author from a later generation, Martin Walser, recalled, in a remembrance that he wrote for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: ''Outside Germany one heard that she was a harsh negotiating partner. That was just her commitment on behalf of her authors.''         ''To enter her room was to come to an ally,'' he added, ''and what does an author need other than allies?''       
         Patricia Moyes, the British mystery writer who created Detective Chief Superintendent Henry Tibbet and his ''merry and plump and comforting'' wife, Emmy, died on Aug. 2 at her home in Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands. She was 77.         Ms. Moyes was known for her cozy, highly civilized, solidly plotted mysteries. As The New York Times Book Review commented, Ms. Moyes handles ''indecorous events'' with ''a minimum of violence and fuss.'' She makes ''drug dealing seem more like bad manners than bad morals.''         Ms. Moyes wrote 19 mysteries, including ''Dead Men Don't Ski'' (1959), ''Death on the Agenda'' (1962), ''Murder a la Mode'' (1963), ''Murder Fantastical'' (1967), ''Falling Star'' (1964), ''Johnny Underground'' (1965) and ''Death and the Dutch Uncle'' (1968). She also wrote ''Many Deadly Returns,'' which was published in 1970 and won the Edgar Allan Poe Special Award from the Mystery Writers of America, as well as ''Angel Death'' (1980), ''Black Girl, White Girl'' (1991) and ''Twice in a Blue Moon'' (1993). Her stories also appeared in Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock magazine.         Born in Dublin in 1923, Ms. Moyes, who was known as Penny, was raised in England. She was the daughter of Ernst Pakenham-Walsh, a judge on the high court in Madras, India, and Marion Pakenham-Walsh. She went to Overstone Girls' School near Northampton, England.         In 1940, she joined the Royal Air Force and became a radar operator and flight officer. In the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, she wrote revue sketches for barrack concerts and a movie script for an R.A.F. documentary film about radar, which was produced by the Rank Organization.         For eight years, Ms. Moyes was the assistant to the actor and director Peter Ustinov. She translated Jean Anouilh's play ''Leocadia,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1957 as ''Time Remembered,'' starring Richard Burton, Helen Hayes and Susan Strasberg. Ms. Moyes also collaborated with Mr. Ustinov on the film script for ''School for Scoundrels,'' which came out in 1960. From 1958 to 1962, she was an assistant editor for British Vogue and wrote the ''Shophound'' column for the magazine.         Ms. Moyes was married twice. Her marriage to John Moyes ended in divorce in the 1960's. Her second marriage was to James Haszard, a linguist who worked as an interpreter at the International Court of Justice in the Hague and later at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. He died in 1994. She is survived by a sister, Barbara Nicholson of Hampshire, England.         In 1959 Ms. Moyes wrote her first novel, ''Dead Men Don't Ski,'' on a whim, introducing Chief Superintendent Henry Tibbet and Emmy, a British sleuthing couple.         In her subsequent mysteries Ms. Moyes stayed with that duo. When she moved to the Virgin Islands in the late 1970's, her characters moved with her. In ''Angel Death,'' the crime takes place at a resort hotel on a Caribbean island.         Ms. Moyes, a cat fanatic who was deeply involved a project to control the breeding of feral cats in the Virgin Islands, also wrote ''After All, They're Only Cats'' in 1973 and ''How to Talk to Your Cat'' in 1991, which the crime columnist for The New York Times Book Review, Marilyn Stasio, called ''an affectionate little book about cat behavior.''         Ms. Moyes's agent in London, Anthea Morton-Saner, said: ''She was one of those women who are considerably more intelligent than they let on. She wore her intellectual ability very lightly.''         Ms. Moyes once confessed her writing secret, The Times of London noted: she wrote, she said, ''for my own pleasure.''       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Linda Grey, a top publishing executive who rose from editorial assistant to president and publisher of the Ballantine Publishing Group, died on Aug. 30. She was 54 and lived in New York.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Alan Davies, a  friend of Ms. Grey's.         Ms. Grey resigned from her position at Ballantine last February during a reorganization of the company that came more than a year after the media conglomerate Bertelsmann moved to acquire Ballantine's parent, Random House.         She got her start in publishing in 1970 as an editorial assistant at Coward McCann & Geoghegan. Later she rose to become managing editor there and then took executive positions at Dell Publishing Company, where she was its editor in chief. In 1981 she moved to Bantam Books as an editorial director and became its publisher and editor in chief in 1985.         She left that position in 1992 to start her own short-lived imprint for the company, Linda Grey Books, which published just one book, ''It Doesn't Take a Hero: The Autobiography of General Norman H. Schwarzkopf.'' The imprint was dissolved the same year after the announcement that Ms. Grey was resigning to become president and publisher of the Ballantine Publishing Group.         Throughout her career Ms. Grey worked with best-selling authors like Lee Iococca, General Schwarzkopf, Shirley MacLaine, Judith Krantz and Robert Ludlum and the suspense writers Michael Palmer and John Saul. Alberto Vitale, her longtime boss as the chief executive at Bantam Doubleday Dell and later Random House, often described Ms. Grey as a ''tremendously good editor.''         After her resignation from the Ballantine Publishing Group, Ms. Grey, who was unmarried, essentially retired from the publishing industry,  although she continued to counsel  authors who were her close friends.       
         Elizabeth Gordon, the influential editor of House Beautiful magazine for more than 20 years, a missionary of taste to the American homemaker and an indefatigable supporter of Frank Lloyd Wright, died on Sept. 3 in Adamstown, Md., where she lived. She was 94.         When she took over as editor of House Beautiful in 1939, Ms. Gordon was determined to educate the American public about appropriate design and new American architecture. She devoted entire issues to topics like climate control and the emerging ranch house in California.         Her ''pace setter'' issues in the late 1940's tracked and explained important trends in design to an audience just learning how to consume. In a 1953 essay, ''The Threat to the Next America,'' she railed against cultural dictatorship and the evils of ''a self-chosen elite who are trying to tell us what we should like and how we should live,'' by which she meant the followers of International-style architecture, the curators at the Museum of Modern Art and European architects like Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.         The article attracted the appreciative attention of Frank Lloyd Wright, who became a mentor and close friend.         Another influential essay in 1960, ''We Invite You to Enter a New Dimension: Shibui,'' extolled the principles of understated resonance and serenity in design and is credited with introducing traditional Japanese design ideas to the American public.         ''She was an amazingly influential editor, crusading for the softer side of contemporary design,'' said Louis Oliver Gropp, the recently retired editor in chief of House Beautiful. ''When she covered a topic she did it in staggering depth.''         Ms. Gordon was born in Logansport, Ind., attended the University of Chicago and briefly taught high school in Wisconsin. In the 1930's she moved to New York to work as a promotional copywriter for several newspapers. She used that job as a springboard to a syndicated column on home maintenance for The New York Herald Tribune, then an editorship at Good Housekeeping, where she remained for eight years.         During the Depression, she wrote a popular how-to book, ''More House for Your Money'' (Morrow).         Ms. Gordon, who always used her maiden name professionally, married Carl Hafey Norcross, a writer and expert on aviation and planned communities, and became a pilot herself. Mr. Norcross died in 1988; Ms. Gordon is survived by a sister-in-law, Gertrude Norcross of San Diego.         At House Beautiful, Ms. Gordon, who was as famous for her large hats as for her imperious taste and insatiable curiosity, once called the magazine ''a propaganda and teaching tool.'' It took her five years of research and seven trips to Japan to prepare for the special issue on shibui. In 1988, she deposited all the materials in an archive at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. Some of her other collections were donated to the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.         But it was her diatribe against the International style that proved a turning point in her career. It virtually equated the style with communism, or at least a foreign architectural invasion, and warned people not to be sure that ''it can't happen here.'' Soon after it was published, she received a mysterious telegram: ''Didn't think you had it in you. Am at your service from here on.'' It was signed only ''Godfather,'' but it came from Wright.         For the rest of the 1950's, the master architect and the determined editor worked closely together. When Wright designed one of his famous Usonian houses for a retrospective exhibition, the editors of House Beautiful furnished it. She called her office ''an extension of Taliesin,'' and allowed Wright to install an apprentice architect from Taliesin as the magazine's architecture editor.         Ms. Gordon devoted two special issues to Wright, keeping the aging architect in the public eye when the eyes of critics had turned elsewhere. He always referred to himself as her Godfather, and designed a bed with built-in cabinets and a jungle motif for her and her husband.         In 1964, Ms. Gordon left the magazine world, angry with the growing intimacy between editorial content and advertising demands.         In the 1970's, she and her husband retired to Maryland and a house filled with Japanese textiles and an Otto Natzler pottery collection. From there she continued to consult and lecture widely on design matters close to her heart.         In 1972, a special issue on Scandinavian design that she had published with an accompanying exhibition that traveled the country won her the insignia of a knight, first class, in the Finnish Order of the Lion. In 1987, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. As her goddaughter Brooke Shearer Talbot said, Ms. Gordon ''wore those big pieces of metal at every opportunity.''         ''She was not afraid to stand out.''       
         Mary Shepard, the modest illustrator whose line drawings of Mary Poppins brought to life the ultimate British nanny in a series of seven books by P. L. Travers published from 1933 to 1988, died in London on Sept. 4. She was 90.         Her father was E. H. Shepard, the illustrator of ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ''The Wind in the Willows.'' When ''Mary Poppins'' was being readied for publication, Pamela Travers wanted him to do the pictures.         He was too busy, but, as Miss Travers wrote almost a half-century later, on a friend's mantle she saw a Christmas card that had ''a happy imperfection, a sense of wonder.'' It was done by Mary Shepard, then 23 and just out of the Slade School of Art.         Travers's editor, Peter Llewelyn Davis (in the tight British literary world he was one of the Lost Boys befriended by J. M. Barrie, and Mr. and Mrs. Banks, the parents in ''Mary Poppins,'' bore more than a passing resemblance to the Darlings of ''Peter Pan''), worried about Miss Shepard's inexperience, but their collaboration had begun.         And it was a collaboration. In an attic, Travers said, she found a wooden peg Dutch doll with painted coal-black hair, a turned-up nose and small, bright blue eyes that became the model.         That doll was later sent to the Donnell Library in Manhattan. But Miss Shepard bought a similar one to use as she drew. She wanted the nanny to stand in the fifth ballet position, with feet turned out and nearly parallel, but Travers insisted on the more comfortable fourth position, with the feet at right angles. Travers died in 1996 at the age of 96.         In the 1964 Walt Disney movie starring Julie Andrews, the time period and decor were pushed back from the 1930's of the book illustrations to a plush Edwardian era, but Ms. Andrews's costume and bearing stayed true to Miss Shepard's drawings (with her feet back to the fifth position), and Miss Shepard received a payment from the filmmakers.         Mary Eleanor Jessie Shepard was born on Christmas Day 1909. She had an idyllic Edwardian childhood and an artistic education.         In 1937 she married E. V. Knox, a friend and colleague of her father's, and outside publishing was known as Mary Knox. Her husband, who had been a widower, was the editor of Punch, the humor magazine. She was only seven years older than Knox's daughter, Penelope, who as Penelope Fitzgerald began publishing novels in her late 50's and died last spring at the age of 83. Knox died in 1971.         As they grew older, the two women became more like sisters. They lived near each other, talked every day and took care of each other, especially after Knox's death.         Miss Shepard was Auntie Mary to Fitzgerald's three children and had only one other relative, Minette Hunt, the daughter of her brother, who was killed in World War II. Her last drawings were made for a Fitzgerald grandchild, shortly after she entered the nursing home where she spent her last years. She did not know that Penelope had died.         A family memorial service was held at the Hampstead Parish Church on Sept. 14, where Miss Shepard worshiped daily as long as she was able. She was so modest that she said she did not wish to be buried with her husband in the pretty Hampstead cemetery because her name would add clutter to his stone.         Instead, the Fitzgerald children, Maria Fitzgerald, Tina Dooley and Balphy Fitzgerald, have arranged that twin stones be placed next to Knox's. They will be side by side above the cremated remains of Penelope and Mary, one showing a hand with a pen, the other, a hand with a paintbrush.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later was editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneer in journalism, especially because she worked at a time when few women held positions of power in the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way to a circulation of 50,000 from 12,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction to and informal education in journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered with  charities. Society columnists called her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had been editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. The two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and kept up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, the Hollywood financier who is Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married Amos Mathews around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up its news coverage.

         Janice Brustlein, whose painting career, pursued under the name Biala, spanned two art capitals and several generations, died on Sept. 24 at her home in Paris. She was 97 and had lived in Paris since 1958.         She was known for cryptic, lusciously painted interiors, still lifes, landscapes and street scenes that hovered between abstraction and representation. They belonged to a trans-Atlantic tradition that included French painters like Matisse, Bonnard and Marquet, as well as Milton Avery and Edward Hopper. She might also be grouped with artists like Loren MacIver, Fairfield Porter and Anne Poor, who borrowed from the abstract tendencies of the New York School while concentrating on their immediate surroundings.         Always carrying a sketchbook, Biala drew her subjects from her homes and studios, the cities she lived in and the places she visited, including Cape Cod, Venice, the French Riviera and Fire Island. Although she preferred to live in Paris, her career was based in New York, where she had regular gallery shows beginning in the 1940's.         Biala was described by her niece, the New York painter Hermine Ford,  as a ''uniquely wonderful, widely beloved character'' whose house in Paris ''would fill in the late afternoon with all kinds of people -- writers, artists, next-door neighbors.'' Her close friends included the photographer Cartier-Bresson, as well as the expatriate American painter Shirley Jaffe. She knew literary Paris as well, having lived there with the English novelist Ford Madox Ford from the late 1920's until his death in 1939, during which time she illustrated some of his novels.         Biala rarely revisited her complicated past -- refusing several offers from potential biographers -- and as a result its facts are not always clear. Neither Ms. Ford, or her sister Helen Tworkov, a founding editor of Tricycle magazine, remember the name their aunt was given at birth.  She was born in 1903, the daughter of a Jewish tailor named Tworkovsky in Biala, a village on the Russian-Polish border. Her father soon left for New York, where he set up a shop on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side; Biala, her mother and her older brother Jacob, who would become the Abstract Expressionist painter Jack Tworkov, followed in 1913.         While both nieces contend that Biala knew she wanted to be a painter from a very early age (before her brother did, in fact), all they know of her artistic education is that at the age of 18 or 19, after a brief period of study at the National Academy of Design, she went to Provincetown, Mass., to study with the painter Edwin Dickinson, whose painterly representation was especially influential on her work. By then she was already living on her own, supporting herself with menial jobs and becoming familiar with Greenwich Village bohemia. Sometime in the mid-1920's she was briefly married to the painter Lee Gatch. After that, a wealthy couple interested in art paid her expenses on a trip to Paris, where she met Ford and became a Francophile.         In 1943, having returned to New York, Biala married Daniel Brustlein, an Alsatian-born painter who contributed cartoons to The New Yorker under the name Alain. Over the next 15 years the couple split their time between Paris and New York. (The McCarran Act did not permit naturalized citizens to live abroad for more than two years at a time.) Their New York circle included Jack and Wally Tworkov, Harold and May Rosenberg, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Saul Steinberg and Hedda Sterne and Rudy Burckhardt. Mr. Brustlein died in 1996.         Biala's first exhibition was at the Passedoit Gallery in Manhattan in 1936, by which point, it is thought, she had already taken the name of her birthplace. She exhibited at the Stable Gallery, an important artists' cooperative, in 1954, 1956 and 1961. In the 1970's and 80's she was represented by the Gruenebaum Gallery in New York and in the 1990's by the Kouros Gallery, where she had her most recent show in 1999.         Despite her love of Paris, Biala never gave up her United States citizenship. She was at home everywhere. ''I never have the feeling of nationality or roots,'' she once said. ''I always had the feeling that I belong where my easel is.''       
         Andy Logan, the reporter whose witty, elegant and gently sarcastic voice dissected the goings-on at New York's City Hall for The New Yorker magazine for 25 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been ill with pancreatic cancer.         For two decades, Ms. Logan was the dean of the City Hall press corps, a diminutive figure in black with an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's social and political history. She was a mentor to dozens of younger reporters and most days carried cookies to the press room, known as Room 9, for the harried reporters she referred to as kids. She covered five mayors, from John V. Lindsay to Rudolph W. Giuliani, and was fond of using their own words to expose hypocrisies and explode myths.         ''The world I cover is so full of vaudeville,'' she told a reporter in 1992. ''The worst thing you can do to politicians is to quote them verbatim. Such naked foolishness.''         Ms. Logan was born in Cleveland on Feb. 6, 1920, and grew up in Ohio and North Carolina. She attended Swarthmore College, where she wrote fiction and started a life of letters. She won an O. Henry Award in 1941 for her first published short story, ''The Visit.''         It was at college that Ms. Logan changed her name from Isabel Ann to Andy. She detested the nickname Izzy and chose Andy in honor of the New Yorker essayist E.B. White, who was also known as Andy.         The New Yorker hired her as soon as she graduated, in 1942, and she became one of the first women to write for ''The Talk of the Town.''  During a half century with the magazine, she wrote more than 260 articles, along with three short stories and four poems. Her subjects ranged from the Nuremberg trials, to 19th century New York scandals, to the yearly review of toys at Christmastime.         In 1943, she married Charles S. Lyon, who was a deputy chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials and later became a United States assistant attorney general. They had seven children. He died in 1989 at the age of 72. She is survived by two sons:  Brooks, of Canandaigua, N.Y., and Jonathan, of New York City; a daughter, Emily Lyon, of Cambridge, Mass.; and one granddaughter, Corinna Lyon.         ''There was nothing to be compared with coming home after school and sitting down with my parents,'' Ms. Logan's daughter said. ''They would talk about everything, and make it so clear.''         Ms. Logan was also the author of two historical books: In ''Against the Evidence'' (McCall, 1970), she chronicled the 1912 trial of a police lieutenant, Charles Becker, who was convicted, wrongly she maintained, of shooting a smalltime gambler. She also published ''The Man Who Robbed the Robber Barons'' (W.W. Norton & Company, 1965), an account of the career of Col. William d'Alton Mann.         But it was at City Hall that she would become a local literary legend. Her first About City Hall column appeared in 1969, though her expert knowledge of city politics stretched back to the La Guardia administration.         ''I can scare the hell out of the kids by telling them that the mayor when I first came down here was La Guardia,'' she said in 1992. ''They help me in and out of the room for at least an hour after that.''         In her City Hall reporting, she earned a reputation for saving every scrap of news about the political figures she covered and forgetting nothing they had said. Her columns often pointed out the comic side of politics, exposing where noble words hide selfish designs.         ''She wrote about the city and City Hall as if it were a passing parade, with a great sense of irony and wit,'' said David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker. ''To me, she was like Murray Kempton, an essential voice and treasure of New York.''         Her columns often did not endear her to mayors. Mayor Edward I. Koch once said he detested her and ''disinvited'' her to the annual Christmas party for reporters at Gracie Mansion, an insult she wore like a badge of honor.         ''She believed in flaying, and most people don't like to be skinned,'' Mr. Koch said yesterday. But in the same breath, he praised her reporting. ''She was a repository of City Hall history,'' he said. ''She had covered so many mayors and kept minute records of everything they said.''         Her unpopularity with some politicians may have reflected her unwillingness to buy their favorite mantras. Ms. Logan's writing often pierced political rhetoric. Writing about Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1992, for instance, she said:         ''The theme of the speech was a message that the mayor delivers daily, and sometimes more often, at City Hall: that the Reagan-Bush administrations abandoned the nation's cities, and particularly this one, and that the federal government should resume its old, generous (Democratic) ways -- that is, 'Send money.' Back in the years when Nelson Rockefeller was New York's governor, he had a habit of working the phrase 'Brotherhood of Man in the Fatherhood of God' so regularly into speeches that Albany reporters would simply write down 'bomfog'  and turn their attention elsewhere. At the Dinkins City Hall, when the mayor brings up the abandonment of cities, often at considerable length, reporters can write down 'ban-cit' and take five.''         To her colleagues in Room 9, Ms. Logan was a teacher and inspiration. George Arzt, who covered city government for The New York Post for 18 years, recalled his first day on the job, when he was asked to cover the Board of Estimate, which he had never heard of before, and to untangle a complicated question pending before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.         ''Andy Logan, who I had never met before, took me by the arm and said, 'Why do you have that wild look in your eyes,' and I said, 'I don't know what I'm doing,' '' he recalled. ''And she sat me down, told me what was going on and practically dictated the story to me.''         Ms. Logan kept her office at The New Yorker until the end of her life.         ''She was sort of the institutional memory of the place,'' said John Bennet, an editor at the magazine. Well into her seventies, colleagues said, she could still be found at her desk late into the evening or on Saturday mornings.         Correction:  November 23, 2000, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Andy Logan, the longtime New York City Hall reporter for The New Yorker, referred imprecisely to her tenure. While her column, About City Hall, appeared from 1969 to 1994 and she was the acknowledged dean of the City Hall press corps for the last 20 years of that time, she wrote about municipal affairs both before and after the life of the column.       
         Rosalind Baker Wilson, an editor and writer who published a memoir of her father, Edmund Wilson, one of America's foremost men of letters, died on Oct. 30 in Syracuse. She was 79 and lived in Talcottville, N.Y.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Tim Page, a friend.         Ms. Wilson was the author of ''Near the Magician: A Memoir of My Father, Edmund Wilson'' (Weidenfeld, 1990). She also published short stories and served as an editor at The New Yorker and Houghton Mifflin, the publisher.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Wilson attended Bennington College and Columbia University and started her career in the 1940's. In the 1960's she moved to Talcottville, the Black River family seat Edmund Wilson memorialized in ''Upstate'' (1970).         She was Wilson's elder daughter, by the first of his four wives, Mary Blair.         She is survived by a stepbrother, Reuell Kimball Wilson of London, Ont.; and a stepsister, Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass.         Correction:  November 11, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the writer and editor Rosalind Baker Wilson on Thursday misstated her relationship to two survivors. Reuel Wilson of London, Ontario, was her half brother and Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass., her half sister -- not stepbrother and stepsister.         Correction:  January 8, 2001, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 9 about Rosalind Baker Wilson, a writer and daughter of the critic Edmund Wilson, misstated her age. She was 77, not 79. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.       
         Jane Troxell Stark, a dealer in exotic fabrics and jewelry who was a fashion editor for magazines including Glamour, died last Saturday outside Mexico City. She was 86 and lived in Alexandria, Va., and San Miguel, Mexico.         Mrs. Stark honed her sense of fashion in the college shop at Lord & Taylor and as a fashion photographer for the B. Altman department store in New York.         In the 1950's and early 1960's, she edited fashion pages at Charm, Glamour and Look magazines. She returned to Lord & Taylor in 1963 as vice president for advertising and window display, a position from which she retired in 1971.         She then set up shop in Tangier, Morocco, to produce caftan dresses for the American market. She also pursued a venture in Mexico, where she designed jewelry of gold, silver and other local materials.         Jane Troxell was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1936.         Her husband, Col. Richard S. Stark, died in 1986 after 40 years of marriage. She is survived by her son from an earlier marriage, John P. Treadwell of Chevy Chase, Md.; a stepson, Morgan B. Stark of Manhattan; two sisters, Elizabeth T. Rice of La Canada Flintridge, Calif., and Nancy T. Shepard of St. Paul; and four grandchildren.       
         Marvel Jackson Cooke, who has been described as the first black woman to work for a white-owned mainstream newspaper, died on Nov. 29 in Manhattan. She was 99 and was a longtime resident of Sugar Hill, Harlem.         Born in Mankato, Minn., and a graduate of the University of Minnesota, Marvel Jackson moved to New York in 1926 and worked as secretary for W. E. B. DuBois, editor of The Crisis, the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Later, she worked for The Amsterdam News and The People's Voice in Harlem.         At The Amsterdam News, she helped organize a unit of the American Newspaper Guild, which struck for 11 weeks in 1935. On the picket line, she met Benjamin J. Davis, later a New York City Council member, who invited her to join the Communist Party.         In 1949, she went to work for The Daily Compass, a successor to the experimental newspaper PM. ''There were no black workers there and no women,'' Ms. Cooke said in 1988. At the time of her hiring, The Chicago Defender, a black-owned paper, called Ms. Cooke the first black woman to get a job as a reporter on a mainstream white-owned paper.         Ms. Cooke's race helped her gain access to certain news events. On one occasion, she was assigned to write about killings committed by a young black man who had been sent home to Brownsville, Brooklyn, from a prison for the criminally insane. The family talked to her while the community barred The Compass's white reporter, Ms. Cooke told Kay Mills in an interview for a 1988 book, ''A Place in the News: From the Women's Pages to the Front Page.''         Ms. Cooke wrote a series about the exploitation of domestic workers. She went to a pickup point in the Bronx to be hired with others seeking work by the day. Some on the corner warned her about employers who turned clocks back so they could pay less, even though the pay was only 80 cents an hour. Sure enough, the woman who hired her tried this trick, but Ms. Cooke insisted on being paid for the full five hours of scrubbing and ironing.         The Compass promoted the series with truck signs that said: ''Read: I Was a Slave, by Marvel Cooke.''         After The Compass closed on Nov. 3, 1952, Ms. Cooke left journalism and worked for left-leaning organizations like the Committee for the Arts, Sciences and Professions and, later, the Angela Davis Defense Fund.         Ms. Cooke's husband, Cecil Cooke, died in 1978. She is survived by a sister, Helen Wilkins Claytor of Grand Rapids, Mich., a former national president of the Y.W.C.A.
