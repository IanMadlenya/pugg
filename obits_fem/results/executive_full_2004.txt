         Linda Stone Davidoff, a civic activist and champion of progressive social causes who ran Elizabeth Holtzman's unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate in New York in 1980, died on Wednesday in Tucson, Ariz. She was 62.         The cause was pneumonia related to acute myelogenous leukemia, said her son, Daniel Kirk-Davidoff. Ms. Stone Davidoff, who lived in New York City, had gone to Tucson on a brief vacation, he said.         Ms. Stone Davidoff was executive director of several nonprofit organizations, including, most recently, the Citizens Union, a government watchdog group based in New York. She also headed the Citizens Union Foundation, a related institution.         She was also active in Democratic politics. In addition to Ms. Holtzman's campaign, she was for a time a manager of Ruth W. Messinger's unsuccessful campaign for mayor of New York City in 1997.         Ms. Stone Davidoff's first marriage, to the urban planner Paul Davidoff, ended with his death in 1984. In 1997 she married Harold Stone.         Besides Mr. Stone, she is survived by her children: Mr. Kirk-Davidoff of Takoma Park, Md., Susan Davidoff of Newton, Mass., Carla Davidoff of New Paltz, N.Y., and Thomas Davidoff of Oakland, Calif.; her stepchildren Christopher Stone of Brooklyn, Nicholas Stone of Falls Church, Va., and Rebecca Stone of Brookline, Mass.; her sisters Jean Stange of Denver and Adria Lique of Hopewell, N.J.; a brother, Richard Greenberg of Springfield, Mass.; and 12 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.       
         Olivia Goldsmith, author of the popular comic novel ''The First Wives Club,'' died late yesterday afternoon at Lenox Hill Hospital from complications related to anesthesia, said her literary agent, Nicholas Ellison. She was 54.         On Wednesday she entered the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospitals for elective surgery to remove loose skin under her chin, Mr. Ellison said. As she went under anesthesia, she had a heart attack and the doctors were unable to get oxygen into her system, he said. She went into a coma, was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital, and never recovered.         Born Randy Goldfield in New York to Mark and Estelle Goldfield, she grew up in Dumont, N.J., and attended New York University.         Ms. Goldfield became one of the first women in the emerging profession of management consulting and quickly became one of the first to be a partner at the firm Booz Allen Hamilton.         But she had always longed to be a writer, her sister Barbara Turner said.         ''She had read everything and, what is more, could recite by memory from everything she read,'' Ms. Turner said.         After a divorce from her husband, a business executive, she lived in London and changed her legal name to Justine Rendal. She created the pen name Olivia Goldsmith, Mr. Ellison said, when she decided to write.         Her debut novel was ''The First Wives Club''(Arrow, 1992), which playfully imagined the revenge of three women who had been dumped by their husbands for younger second wives. A best seller, that book was also made into a successful movie in 1996, starring Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler. Ms. Hawn played a flashy Hollywood diva who had plastic surgery to retain her youthful looks, but wound up with a decidedly comic outcome.         Ms. Goldsmith wrote more than a half dozen humorous novels, including ''Switcheroo'' (HarperCollins, 1998) and ''Young Wives'' (HarperCollins, 2000).         Although critics frequently dismissed her books as trite, she kept a solid following among readers and Hollywood producers who found her tales highly satisfying social commentary, if not high literary art.         In an interview with The Sunday Express of London, she said she wrote from anger, and she told ABC in 1998: ''Well, I just like things to work out fairly, you know? And that's why I write fiction, because in real life they don't always -- everything isn't fair. And, you know, the cards are stacked against women.''         Said Mr. Ellison, ''She wrote these wonderful, celebratory satires, which seamlessly wove her moral convictions and instruction into these popular entertainments.''         In addition to her mother and sister, Ms. Goldsmith's survivors include another sister, Kate Goldfield.         Correction:  January 20, 2004, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about the novelist Olivia Goldsmith, who died of complications related to anesthesia for elective surgery, misstated the date she entered the hospital. It was Jan. 7, not Jan. 14. The obituary also misidentified the first publisher of her debut novel, ''The First Wives Club.'' It was Poseidon Press, not Arrow.       
         Eleanor Holm Whalen, an Olympic swimming champion who was expelled from the 1936 Berlin Games in a headline-making drinking episode that brought her a second career as a slightly notorious but glamorous show-business figure, died Saturday at her home in Miami.         The cause was kidney failure, said her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Flotron.         By her own account, she would have been 90 at her death, but her sister-in-law said she was 91.         When she boarded the S.S. Manhattan in New York Harbor on July 15, 1936, with some 330 fellow Olympians bound for the Berlin Olympics, Eleanor Holm Jarrett, as she was then known, stood at the pinnacle of the swimming world. She had captured the 100-meter backstroke at the 1932 Los Angeles Games and had set world records in that event and the 200-meter backstroke. She had not lost a race in seven years and was the first female swimmer to be chosen for three American Olympic teams.         But when the ship docked at Hamburg, Germany, she was no longer a member of the Olympic team. The American Olympic Committee and its president, Avery Brundage, had expelled her from the Games for carousing and breaking curfew, an incident that became one of the most publicized flaps in Olympic history.         Her actions seem tame by modern standards, when sports pages have no shortage of accounts detailing drug abuse, criminal behavior and narcissism. But the tale of Olympic partying and drinking that emerged in 1936 enthralled readers who were hardly used to hearing about athletes' lives beyond the playing fields.         Eleanor Holm was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a New York Fire Department officer, and learned to swim at the pool near her family's summer cottage in Long Beach, N.Y.         She finished fifth in the 100-meter backstroke at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. Having won a gold medal in the backstroke at the Los Angeles Games in 1932, she was favored to repeat at the Berlin Olympics. But that was before she incurred the wrath of Brundage, the powerful American Olympic chief.         Holm was both a world-class swimmer and eminently worldly. She had married Art Jarrett, a bandleader, singer and fellow graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, in September 1933. She had appeared with his band, wearing a white bathing suit and white cowboy hat with high heels, singing ''I'm an Old Cowhand.'' She had bit parts in several Warner Brothers movies.         Two days after the Olympians' ship left for the Berlin Games, Holm was invited to an all-night party for sportswriters on the first-class deck. Her drinking there and her violation of curfew brought a warning from Olympic officials.         Then, during a stopover in Cherbourg, France, she won a couple of hundred dollars playing dice with sportswriters aboard the ship during the afternoon. That night, she attended another party with them.         In an interview for ''All That Glitters Is Not Gold,'' by William O. Johnson, she remembered the moment:         ''This chaperone came up to me and told me it was time to go to bed. God, it was about 9 o'clock, and who wanted to go down in that basement to sleep anyway? So I said to her: 'Oh, is it really bedtime? Did you make the Olympic team or did I?' I had had a few glasses of Champagne. So she went to Brundage and complained that I was setting a bad example for the team, and they got together and told me the next morning that I was fired. I was heartbroken.''         According to ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' by David Wallechinsky, the Olympic team doctor had reported that she was suffering from acute alcoholism, but Holm denied it.         Holm maintained that many of her fellow athletes had also been drinking on the voyage because there was no ban on alcohol, and some 200 team members petitioned Brundage to reverse the ban. But Brundage, who ruled amateur athletics in the United States for decades, stood fast.         ''I was everything that Avery Brundage hated,'' Holm said in ''Tales of Gold,'' by Lewis H. Carlson and John J. Fogarty. ''I had a few dollars, and athletes were supposed to be poor. I worked in nightclubs, and athletes shouldn't do that. I was married.''         She went on to recall: ''But he rained on my parade for only a very short time. He did make me famous. I would have been just another female backstroke swimmer without Brundage.''         While Nida Senff of the Netherlands was winning Holm's specialty, the 100-meter backstroke, with American entries finishing third and fourth, Holm joined her sportswriter friends. Hired by the International News Service to file reports on the Games, she became a celebrity presence in the press area, although her articles were ghostwritten.         She also attended receptions held by Hitler and other Nazi leaders. Hermann Goering, the Luftwaffe chief, gave her a silver swastika he took off his uniform. When Holm married Billy Rose, who was Jewish, she had it copied in gold and then placed a Star of David set in diamonds inside it.         After the Olympics, Holm continued in her singing act and was co-featured in the 1938 20th Century Fox movie ''Tarzan's Revenge,'' playing alongside Glenn Morris, the 1936 Olympic decathlon champion, who was cast as Tarzan.         After her divorce from Jarrett in 1939, Holm married Rose, who had obtained a divorce from the comedian Fannie Brice. Co-featured with Johnny Weismuller and then Buster Crabbe, Holm did 39 shows a week at Rose's Aquacade in the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940.         ''I thought I'd never be dry,'' she recalled in ''Tales of Gold.''         ''My hair turned green from the chlorine, and swimming on those cold October and November nights in New York was awful.''         Holm lived with Rose in a five-story, 14-room house on Beekman Place in Manhattan. They were divorced in 1954. She later married Tom Whalen, a retired oil executive, and settled in the Miami area.         She had no children and is survived by two nieces. Whalen died in 1984.         ''I don't swim anymore, I just play tennis,'' she told Dave Anderson of The New York Times in 1984. ''But I still have my 1932 Olympic bathing suit. It's blue with a red, white and blue shield on the front. It's long-waisted with a little skirt. And I don't drink Champagne anymore. Just a little dry white wine.''       
         Mary Frances Diaz, the executive director of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, died last Thursday at Columbia Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. She was 42 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, the commission announced.         Ms. Diaz's organization, a volunteer group that works to provide a voice for women and children in war zones, is a nongovernmental group that advocates for refugees before the United Nations and around the world.         Mary Diaz had led the group since 1994 and continued her work until late last year.         The commission, working under the auspices of the International Rescue Committee, was founded in 1989 by the actress Liv Ullman. Ms. Diaz became its chief investigator, strategist, watchdog and lobbyist.         She deployed volunteers in Africa, the Middle East, South America and trouble spots like Kosovo and Afghanistan. She often went to the scene herself, visiting refugees in Bosnia and Burundi fleeing to the relative safety in Tanzania.         Mary Diaz was born in Newport News, Va., and grew up in suburban Pottstown, Pa.         She focused on international relations at Brown, graduating in 1982. She took a job at a Philadelphia television station writing news late in the day, which left her time for volunteer work helping refugees to settle in the city. Her calling gradually shifted from the newsroom to the outside world. She studied administration, planning and social policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, receiving a master's degree in international education in 1988. She became director of refugee and immigration services for Catholic Charities in Boston before becoming head of the Women's Commission in New York.         Ms. Diaz is survived by her partner, Tom Ferguson; her mother, Bertha Diaz of Pottstown; two brothers, Dr. Philip Diaz of Columbus, Ohio, and Dr. Joseph Diaz of Barrington, R.I.; and two sisters, Teresa Diaz of Reading, Pa., and Bernadette Diaz of Oak Park, Ill.       
         Irma Fleck, a physician's wife who looked at the vacant lots and abandoned buildings of her South Bronx neighborhood and retaliated by starting organizations to celebrate art and turn rubble piles into emerald oases, died on Feb. 11 in Naples, Fla.         She was 84 and lived in Naples.         The cause was complications after a broken hip, said her daughter, Bonnie Oppenberg.         Among many other initiatives, Mrs. Fleck helped develop the Claremont Neighborhood Center in the South Bronx, the Bronx Council on the Arts and the Bronx Museum. She also hatched a plan to turn compost from the Hunts Point Market into compost for developing lots that had been ravaged by arson.         ''When I work at something, it's like my child,'' she said in an interview with Newsday in 1994. ''I work intensively, and whatever the project, it becomes very important to me.''         Herman Badillo, a former Bronx borough president, said in an interview yesterday that he remembered Mrs. Fleck as being very aggressive in pursuing project after project.         ''She was one of the most active volunteers in the Bronx,'' he said.         Fernando Ferrer, another former Bronx borough president, said in an interview with The Riverdale Press last week that Mrs. Fleck ''put her own stamp on the Bronx in a very important way.''         Irma Lowenthal was born on Oct. 28, 1919, in Poland, the second of three children. Her father, a doctor, ran his practice out of the family's home near Crotona Park, in the heart of the South Bronx. In the three-story house, the family often put up Jewish refugees who like themselves had fled Hitler.         Miss Lowenthal graduated from Walton High School, earned degrees from Queens College and New York University and worked for her father as an X-ray technician. In 1940, she married Henry Fleck, a physician who had fled Europe in 1932. The newlyweds moved in with relatives on Washington Avenue in the Bronx.         The couple continued living in the Washington Avenue house, where Mrs. Fleck had two children, who survive her, Mrs. Oppenberg, of Marco Island, Fla., and Gary Fleck of Safat, Israel. She is also survived by two brothers, both of whom live in New Jersey, and two grandsons. Dr. Fleck died in 1990.         She believed a physician's wife should be active in the community in which he worked and in 1956 was a founder of the Claremont Neighborhood Center on East 169th Street. She was its president for 11 years, successfully pushing initiatives for affordable housing.         The Flecks moved to a penthouse on the Grand Concourse in the 1960's, and in the 1970's Mrs. Fleck held meetings there to try to reverse the decline of the South Bronx. Eventually, these meetings and contacts would lead to the Bronx Museum, which Mrs. Fleck helped found, forming a group in 1986 called the Committee to Make the Concourse Grand Again.         In 1967, Mrs. Fleck formed the Bronx Committee on the Arts. It soon merged with the Bronx Council on the Arts, formed by Gerald Klot in 1961. Mr. Klot's long involvement in the arts in the Bronx included organizing the Bronx Symphony Orchestra in 1945.         The new organization took the name of Mr. Klot's organization and found a home at the Bronx Community College, part of the City University of New York.         At first, ''We had a couple of drawers in a file there,'' Mrs. Fleck said in an interview with The New York Times in 1971.         The council soon found itself coordinating a host of cultural groups, including the Bronx Opera Company, the Bronx Experimental Theater, the Festival of Poetry and the Bronx Showcase of the Visual Arts.         Mrs. Fleck, as executive director of the council, was proudest of her role in creating the museum. It was housed until 1982 in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse, and from the beginning its exhibitions focused on contemporary artists, minority artists and artists from the Bronx.         In 1982, the museum took over the former Young Israel of the Concourse Synagogue, on the corner of 165th Street and the Grand Concourse, which had been sold to the city by its dwindling congregation. Mrs. Fleck raised public and private money to build an exhibition gallery, classrooms and offices, as well as a new glass-walled lobby.         Perhaps her best known accomplishment was collecting spoiling produce from the huge wholesale center at Hunts Point and selling it for compost. With Jack Flanagan, a former police officer, she formed the Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, which collected as much as 40 tons of compost daily.         The compost was used to fertilize new gardens on vacant lots. ''We're in the recycling business,'' Mrs. Fleck said. ''We're recycling land.''         When the vegetable market began to bag its waste in plastic, Mrs. Fleck persuaded the Bronx Zoo to give her the droppings of elephants and other herbivores to use for fertilizer. She called it ZooDoo, and sold some of it in two-pound bags for $2.50 in smart Manhattan stores.       
         Estelle Stewart Axton, whose name put the ''Ax'' in Stax Records, the Memphis soul label she founded with her brother, died on Tuesday in Memphis. She was 85.         She died at the St. Francis Nursing Home after a series of strokes, said Deanie Parker, the president and chief executive of Soulsville, the nonprofit corporation that runs the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.         In the heyday of 1960's and 70's soul, Stax released hits by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas and the Staple Singers, among many others. It was the second-best-selling soul label of its era, behind Motown Records.         The Stax studio, in the former Capitol movie theater in Memphis, attracted young singers and songwriters, and was an integrated business in a largely segregated city. Ms. Axton and her brother, James Stewart, founders of the label, were white; most of their hitmakers were black; and the label's studio band, Booker T. and the MG's, was mixed. ''We never looked at color; we looked at people,'' Ms. Axton said last year.         Stax got started as Satellite Records in 1957, when Mr. Stewart, a country fiddler who worked at a bank, began recording country songs in his wife's uncle's garage, but soon switched to rhythm-and-blues. His eldest sister, Estelle Stewart, who had married Everett Axton in 1941, became Mr. Stewart's partner in 1958 when she took out a second mortgage on her home to buy recording equipment. In 1960 they leased the abandoned theater, in a mixed neighborhood that was fast becoming an African-American ghetto, and made it the company's offices and recording studio.         To generate income they installed a record store at the theater's old candy counter. The shop, Satellite Records, drew teenagers and became a place to recruit talent and a test market for their new releases. The first singers to record at the studio were Rufus Thomas and Carla Thomas, father and daughter, and their rhythm-and-blues song ''Cause I Love You'' became the label's first regional hit, followed by Carla Thomas's ''Gee Whiz.''         The label's third hit, ''Last Night,'' was an instrumental by the Mar-Keys, a group including Ms. Axton's son, Charles (nicknamed Packy) Axton, on saxophone. After ''Last Night'' was released, a Satellite Records label in California noticed the company. Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton changed their label's name to Stax, from the first letters of Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton's last names.         The label began regularly releasing hits through the 1960's. Musicians called Ms. Axton Lady A., and in Rob Bowman's ''Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records'' (Schirmer Trade Books, 1997), the guitarist and songwriter Steve Cropper describes her as ''the heart and soul of that whole place.''         She nurtured songwriters, ran the record store and helped decide what Stax released, including, over her brother's initial opposition, Eddie Floyd's ''Knock on Wood.''         Although Stax was a musical powerhouse, it was a business debacle. After bad deals with major labels, the company went bankrupt in 1975. By then Ms. Axton was no longer with the company. In 1969, after disagreement about the label's direction, she quietly left the company in 1969, bought out by her brother and the label's president, Al Bell.         Part of her settlement included $25,000 a year on the condition that she stay out of the recording business. Her son Charles became the head of Fretone Records, and in 1974 Ms. Axton took over. That label's big hit, in 1976, was the Rick Dees novelty song ''Disco Duck.''         Ms. Axton is survived by her sister, Mary Lucille McAlpin; her brother, Mr. Stewart; her daughter, Doris Axton Fredrick; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Stax's headquarters was demolished in 1989, but last year a new building on the site, complete with a reproduction of the studio and a new Satellite Record Shop, opened as the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.       
         Trude Wenzel Lash, inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become a children's advocate through the Citizens Commission for Children of New York, died on Wednesday at her home in Greenwich Village, her family said. She was 95.         Mrs. Lash was an early mainstay of the commission, which Mrs. Roosevelt helped found in 1944. Mrs. Lash, a refugee from Germany who befriended Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt, became the commission's program director in 1946 and was its executive director from 1952 to 1972.         After that, Mrs. Lash devoted herself to the Roosevelt legacy through the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y. Until 2000, she was the institute's co-chairwoman with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and at her death both were honorary chairmen of the institute, housed at the Franklin Roosevelt Library.         Trude Lash was born Gertrud Wenzel in June 1908 in Freiburg, Germany. A rebellious girl and brilliant student, she was thrown out of convent school, went on to study journalism in Berlin and, while teaching kindergarten and first grade, attended the University of Heidelberg.         At the University of Freiburg, she received a doctorate in philosophy in 1930. She came to New York for a year as an exchange teacher of philosophy and German literature at Hunter College while doing graduate work in the social sciences at Columbia.         Back in Germany, she wrote for a newspaper opposed to the Nazis. But in 1932 she returned to New York for good as the wife of Eliot D. Pratt, a member of a socially prominent family, and the couple helped other refugees from Europe find their way to the United States. They were divorced in 1943, and he died in 1969.         In 1944, she married Joseph P. Lash, a journalist and confidant of Eleanor Roosevelt, who played matchmaker to the couple. Mr. Lash wrote the two-volume biography ''Eleanor and Franklin,'' published in 1972.         Mrs. Lash, who worked for the Human Rights Commission at the United Nations before joining the staff of the Citizens Commission for Children, collected data on the status of children in New York for major studies in 1976 and 1980. She was principal investigator for the studies' reports, called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' The reports were influential in inspiring similar studies elsewhere.         After retiring, she continued her advocacy through the Foundation for Child Development and became directly involved in the Roosevelt memorials. After Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962, Congress had authorized an Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. Mrs. Lash helped establish the combined Franklin and Eleanor Institute in 1984 and until just before her death remained a consultant on Roosevelt memorabilia.         Trude Wenzel Lash is survived by three sons, Dr. Peter W. Pratt of Bridgewater, Conn., Roger S. Pratt of New Milford, Conn., and Jonathan Lash of Washington; a daughter, Vera C. Pratt, also of Washington; a brother, Heinz Wenzel of Germany; 11 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. Joseph Lash died in 1987.         Her commission work, which ranged from studying day care and foster care to juvenile detention, often involved sending volunteers to institutions to see how children were treated. It sometimes led to confrontations with officialdom.         ''All too often we take our most difficult children and we turn over their care to professionals, and we leave the matter,'' Trude Lash said in an interiew with The New York Times in 1972. ''But professionals, even good ones, are primarily interested in their jobs and their routines. What is needed is someone who is primarily interested in the children.''         Correction:  February 7, 2004, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Trude Wenzel Lash, an advocate for children in New York City, misstated the name of the organization for which she worked until 1972. It is the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, not Citizens Commission. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the name of the organization for which she later worked on reports called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' It is the Foundation for Child Development, not the committee.       
         Lynn L. Seidler, the former executive director of the Shubert Foundation, which provides grants to support live professional theater and dance, died on Thursday while vacationing in the Turks and Caicos Islands. She was 67 and lived in Sanibel, Fla.         The cause was lung cancer, which was diagnosed a year ago, said her husband, Lee J. Seidler.         Ms. Seidler became the foundation's first director in 1975, turning it into one of the largest grant-making institutions for the arts in the country.         Under Ms. Seidler's leadership, the program took an unconventional approach to giving money. Instead of putting funds into bricks and mortar, she set Shubert grants aside for non-profit theaters, drama schools and dance companies in need of help with operating expenses.         The foundation currently distributes several hundred grants each year, ranging from $5,000 to $275,000. Last year it gave $13 million.         Ms. Seidler also founded the Shubert Archive. In 1976 she dusted off a trove of materials that for years had been sitting in boxes in the attics and basements of various Shubert theaters. With six million items, the archive is now one of the largest collections of theater memorabilia in the country.         Ms. Seidler retired from the foundation in 1994.         She was born Lynn Lopatin in New Brunswick, N.J., on Aug. 13, 1936. She received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Lake Erie College in 1958 and a master's degree in speech therapy from New York University in 1970.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, William Lopatin of Sanibel; a daughter, Laurie, of San Jose, Calif.; and a grandson.       
         Jane Engelhard, a philanthropist and art collector whose many gifts ranged from major donations to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Christmas crèche displayed at the White House, died on Sunday at her home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 86.         The cause was pneumonia, her daughter Annette de la Renta said.         As the wife of Charles Engelhard, owner of a vast international business empire, she helped Jacqueline Kennedy restore the White House, regularly made best-dressed lists and was such a fixture of New York society, its own magazines recounted, that socialites affectionately called her ''Our Mother Superior.'' After Mr. Engelhard's death in 1971, Mrs. Engelhard continued to display eclectic taste in her personal collecting, picking up rarities like the original presidential proclamation of the Louisiana Purchase as well as the perhaps predictable Monets.         Her gifts to the Met included the Charles Engelhard Court in the museum's American Wing in 1980. She was a trustee from 1974 until 1981, when she became a trustee emeritus.         She also gave to many smaller institutions, including the Newark Museum and the New Jersey Symphony, paying all of the salary expenses of the orchestra in some years.         Her contributions often went beyond money, as when she and Laurance S. Rockefeller and Brooke Astor in 1976 came up with the idea of planting a grove along the Potomac River to honor President Lyndon B. Johnson. From the administration of John F. Kennedy to that of George W. Bush, she served on committees to preserve the White House.         Jane Pinto-Reis Brian was born on Aug. 12, 1917, in Qingdao, China, where her father was serving as Brazil's ambassador. The family moved to Paris, where she was educated at the Couvent des Oiseaux.         Vogue reported that ''at 16 or so, black-eyed, confident and competent beyond her years,'' she married Fritz Mannheimer, a Dutch banker and, like Mr. Engelhard, thought to be one of the world's richest men. Eight weeks after they wed, Dr. Mannheimer died. The next day, his investment house closed, bankrupt.         She did inherit a microfilm company that copied United States war records and material for the Library of Congress, on whose board she later served. She was executive vice president of the microfilm company. After five years there, she married Mr. Engelhard, whose portfolio (ranging from gold, platinum, diamonds and timber to racehorses like Nijinsky II, a winner of the English Triple Crown) was once referred to as ''a consortium of conglomerates.''         They had houses in Johannesburg, in Maine and on the Gaspé Peninsula of Canada, and apartments in Manhattan, Rome and London. But they spent most of their time at their estate in Far Hills, N.J., where they kept champion golden retrievers and a pet lion roamed.         The Engelhards were active in Democratic Party politics. President Kennedy dispatched them as his representatives on diplomatic occasions.         President Johnson continued to send the Engelhards on diplomatic missions. But they proved even more useful as a bridge between Kennedy and Johnson loyalists.         In addition to Mrs. de la Renta, who lives in Manhattan and Kent, Conn., Mrs. Engelhard is survived by her four other daughters, Susan O'Connor of Missoula, Mont.; Sophie Craighead of Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Sally Pingree of Washington; and Charlene Engelhard of Concord, Mass.; two sisters, Brigitte de la Rochefoucauld of Paris and Madame Jacque Bemberg of Lausanne, Switzerland; 12 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Marge Schott, who evoked the image of a charming eccentric when she bought the Cincinnati Reds in 1984 but became a baseball pariah for offensive racial and ethnic remarks, died yesterday in Cincinnati. She was 75.         Her death was announced by Christ Hospital, where she had been treated for several weeks. She had lung-related problems in recent years, The Associated Press said.         When she took control of the Reds, Mrs. Schott, a socially prominent widow and heir to an industrial fortune, was the only female owner in the major leagues who had bought a team in her own right. Joan Kroc of the San Diego Padres and Jean Yawkey of the Boston Red Sox had inherited their franchises from their husbands.         She appeared at her introductory news conference with her 170-pound St. Bernard, Schottzie, who, clad in a Reds cap, perched on the feet of Manager Pete Rose. She maintained that in purchasing the team, she might have prevented its move out of Cincinnati. It seemed that she might be an astute baseball promoter, and she was a formidable contributor to Cincinnati area charities.         But a series of gaffes and intolerant remarks caused Mrs. Schott to lose control of the Reds in 1999. In her 15 years as owner, a franchise that had thrived in the 1970's as the Big Red Machine had seven managers but only one pennant-winner, the World Series champions of 1990.         Mrs. Schott's image first soured in November 1992 when several former Reds executives said that she had referred to players and business associates using racial and ethnic slurs. In an interview that month with The New York Times, she said that ''Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far.''         Mrs. Schott denied she was a racist, but acknowledged she had sometimes used a racial epithet.         Asked in a deposition for a lawsuit brought by a former Reds employee if she was prejudiced against Jews in light of possessing a Nazi armband -- a war souvenir -- she responded: ''No. They are not smarter than us, just sharper.'' The uproar over Mrs. Schott's remarks prompted baseball's leadership to suspend her from day-to-day oversight of the Reds for the 1993 season. After she made a similar comment about Hitler in May 1996, she was forced to relinquish her daily control of the Reds again and she never regained it.         In October 1999, Mrs. Schott turned over control of the team to a group headed by Carl Lindner, one of the limited partners, in a $67 million deal. She remained in Reds ownership as a limited partner.         Mrs. Schott was a major contributor to local charitable causes, including Children's Hospital and the Cincinnati Zoo.         ''Marge was a paradox,'' Mayor Charlie Luken of Cincinnati told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon her death. ''While there is no excusing some of the indelicate things she said, there was a kindness to Marge that made her a woman of the people.''         She was born Margaret Unnewehr, the second of five daughters of Edward Unnewehr, a Cincinnati native who made a fortune in the lumber business.         ''My father was Achtung-German,'' Mrs. Schott recalled in 1992. ''He used to ring a bell when he wanted my mother. When I was 21 and went to vote, he told me who to vote for. I said, 'Yes, Daddy.' ''         She married Charles Schott, a member of a wealthy Cincinnati family, in 1952, and gained notice for the parties she held for friends and charities at her mansion in the suburb of Indian Hill.         When her husband died of a heart attack in 1968, Mrs. Schott inherited auto dealerships in Cincinnati and interests in insurance, brick manufacturing, concrete products and landfills.         She became a limited partner in the Reds' ownership in 1981 and was named the general partner on Dec. 21, 1984, when she purchased the controlling interest held by the brothers James and William Williams and shares held by two other limited partners, reportedly for $11 million.         Mrs. Schott called her purchase of the Reds a ''Christmas gift to the people of Cincinnati.'' She said she was concerned that the Williams brothers might sell the franchise, which reported $4 million in losses in 1984, to an out-of-city group.         Mrs. Schott promoted the team at functions, and she loved to take part in the Wave from her box seat at Riverfront Stadium. But the allegations in 1992 concerning offensive remarks tarnished her image.         The next February, baseball's executive council suspended Mrs. Schott for the 1993 season and fined her $25,000 for ''the most base and demeaning type of racial and ethnic stereotyping.''         Mrs. Schott had apologized for any offensive remarks, but in an interview for ABC-TV's ''Primetime Live'' after the suspension, she suggested the inquiry was a ''witch hunt'' and said, ''I think if I had been a man this would never have happened.''         A month after that suspension was imposed, baseball's executive council banned Schottzie 02 -- another of her St. Bernards -- from the Riverfront Stadium field, citing ''numerous complaints by the players.''         Mrs. Schott had no children, to her great regret. She bestowed great affection on her dogs and delighted in parading with her St. Bernards around the Reds' ballpark and rubbing the dogs' fur on her players.         In yet another incident, Lou Piniella, who had taken the Reds to the World Series championship in his first year as manager, rejected a two-year contract extension after the 1992 season. He said later that a major factor in his leaving was the failure of the Reds' management to support him in a defamation suit -- later dropped -- that was filed by Umpire Gary Darling and the Major League Umpires Association.         Another embarrassment for Mrs. Schott arrived in 1996.         After the season-opening game at Cincinnati had been called off when Umpire John McSherry sustained a fatal heart attack in the first inning, Mrs. Schott told The Cincinnati Enquirer: ''I feel cheated. Nobody feels worse than me.''         She compounded that gaffe with her sympathy offering to the umpiring crew; according to published reports, it was a recycled bouquet given to her by the team's television affiliate.         On June 12, 1996, Mrs. Schott agreed to give up daily operation of the Reds through the 1998 season, having been told by baseball's executive council that she would be suspended again if she did not do so. She turned over day-to-day affairs to John Allen, the team's controller.         Mrs. Schott is survived by her sisters, Charlotte Crane, Winnie Fraser, Caroline Paddock and Mary Elizabeth Unnewehr.         ''I guess I always thought of her as a tragic figure,'' the former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent told The Associated Press. ''I think she tried very hard to do the right things for baseball, but she had some enormous limitations and she had some difficulty overcoming them.''       
         Margaret Westheimer Tishman, an organizer of the merged UJA-Federation of New York and its first president, died on Friday in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived on the Upper East Side.         Her death was announced by the organization, in which she had been active for many years while it was the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. The organization, founded in 1917, merged in 1986 with the United Jewish Appeal of New York. After the groups combined, she was the organization's president until 1989 and kept working and raising money for it until last month.         Peggy Tishman was the widow of Alan V. Tishman, a member of the real estate development dynasty founded by his grandfather Julius. Mr. Tishman died on Jan. 13 at 86, after 62 years of marriage.         Mrs. Tishman was one of the first women to gain national recognition as the chief executive of a major charitable federation. She was credited with bolstering UJA-Federation and its fund-raising mission to help Jews in New York, in Israel and worldwide.         Locally, she was on the UJA-Federation committee that started the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged as a separate agency in 1968, and she developed an endowment program to support such work.         She was on the boards of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Home and Hospital and was president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York.         Peggy Westheimer, as she was known before her marriage, was born on Dec. 5, 1919, in Manhattan. She was a graduate of Wellesley College and received an M.A. in education and psychology from Fairfield University. She was a trustee of Wellesley and a former president of its National Development Fund Council.         She gained a national reputation in 1954 when she joined the board of the Jewish Home and Hospital amid a growing debate over how society cared for its elderly. She helped persuade the Jewish Home to build one of the country's first assisted-living residences for older adults.         Professionally, she was a vice president of the Tishman East Management Corporation and a director of Bank Leumi. She also served on the city's Commission on Heroin Addiction and twice was a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging.         Mrs. Tishman is survived by a daughter, Pat T. Hall of Santa Fe, N.M.; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Estée Lauder, the last great independent titan of the cosmetics industry, who convinced generations of women that her beauty creams were ''jars of hope'' in their quest for the eternal look of youth, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her family, in announcing her death, said she was 97.         ''The pursuit of beauty is honorable,'' Mrs. Lauder used to say. And she clearly believed that the business of beauty was just as honorable. No one but a believer could have given so much of herself in becoming an internationally respected strategist in the age-old struggle against wrinkles, sags, bags and blemishes. Her weapons in that effort were creams, powders, ointments, potions and muds, many containing top-secret emollients. And if they didn't do the trick, she had an array of scents, equally secret in their constitution, that might befog man's vision of woman aging.         Her efforts resulted in the establishment of a company estimated to be worth about $5 billion when it went public in 1995 and she was given the title of founding chairwoman. In 2003, it had 21,500 employees and an estimated worth of about $10 billion. Its products are sold in more than 130 countries across five continents.         Estée Lauder Companies was not formally established until 1946 but its roots go back to the 1920's with facial creams concocted over a gas stove in a modest kitchen by Mrs. Lauder's uncle, John Schotz. It was nurtured financially and technically years later by Arnold L. van Ameringen, a Dutch-born industrialist. The company grew exponentially in the 1950's with the introduction of a bath oil called Youth-Dew, the creation of which is variously attributed to Mrs. Lauder and Mr. van Ameringen.         In the years after the start of her almost messianic crusade to give women the perennial bloom of youth, Mrs. Lauder marketed a variety of other beauty aids, among them Super-Rich All Purpose Creme, Cleaning Oil, Creme Pack and a skin lotion (all of them the creations of Dr. Schotz). In all, she marketed some 2,000 individual shades and items produced by five Lauder companies: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Prescriptives and (for men) Aramis. Among the fragrances she introduced were Estée (1968), Azuree (1969), Aliage (1972), Private Collection (1973), Beautiful (1985) and Pleasures (1995).         In 1995 the company also entered into a licensing agreement with the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to market Tommy, a line of fragrances, and with Make-Up Artists Cosmetics of Toronto to distribute its MAC products outside North America.         ''I love my product,'' Mrs. Lauder once said. ''I love to touch the creams, smell them, look at them, carry them with me. A person has to love her harvest if she's to expect others to love it.''         Mrs. Lauder also loved to touch her customers. During the period when she was building her business, she invariably showed up at stores where her products were being introduced and, with no provocation at all, whip out a jar and rub its contents on the wrist or face of a prospective customer so that her skin would acquire ''a gentle glow.''         She also understood the rewards that come from generosity and she was known in the industry for her free samples and particularly for the concept of ''gift with purchase.'' She introduced these creative marketing measures when her company was in its infancy and she was advised by an agency that the $50,000 she had available for advertising was not enough to have any effect.         Although she was protective toward those who trusted her to create effective products, she used stark candor to describe her competitors, all of them ferocious and all of whom she outlived by many years. She referred to Charles Revson as ''my arch and implacable enemy'' and she said that Elizabeth Arden was ''not a nice woman, not a generous woman.'' She said that Sam Rubin of Fabergé was ''patronizing even for those prefeminist days'' and that although Helena Rubenstein may have looked like a czarina, ''the skin on her neck was less than perfect.''         Perfection in the face of woman consumed Mrs. Lauder, and so did her desire to make a lot of money and leave the conditions of her childhood behind her. ''Someday, I will have whatever I want,'' she is said to have predicted many years ago. By the late 1980's, with personal assets of $233 million and a listing in Forbes's gallery of the 400 richest Americans, it was clear that she had made her prediction come true.         Although the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry led many women to believe that Estée Lauder was born in Europe to an aristocratic family, she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all. Josephine Esther Mentzer was born at home in Corona, Queens, on July 1, 1908, according to several biographies, although her family believes it may have been two years earlier. She was the daughter of Max Mentzer, a hardware man who was the proprietor of a hay and seed store, and Rose Schotz Rosenthal Mentzer, a woman who was much interested in beauty regimens.         The Mentzers were hard-working immigrants and Esther, destined to become known to the world by the diminutive of Estée, recalled well the Christmastime wrapping of gifts of hammers and nails, her father's gifts to his customers.         In her 1985 autobiography, ''Estée, A Success Story,'' Mrs. Lauder recalled her mother as ''a Hungarian beauty whose mother was a French Catholic and whose father was a Hungarian Jew.'' She described her father as ''an elegant, dapper monarchist in Europe, who, when transported to a new country, still carried a cane and gloves on Sundays.''         In interviews conducted over the years with various journalists, Mrs. Lauder said much that indicated her beginnings were quite genteel and comfortable. But Lee Israel, whose unauthorized biography, ''Estée Lauder, Beyond the Magic,'' was also published in 1985, maintained that the Lauder family's life in a working-class Italian neighborhood was much more modest than Mrs. Lauder would acknowledge.         Whatever her circumstances, there was no quarrel about the suggestion that as a young girl, Estée, a petite blonde, was known for her lovely skin and her determination to always look good. This determination was heightened when, as a student at Newtown High School in Queens, she became interested in the work of her uncle, John Schotz.         He had come to the United States from Hungary in 1900 with considerable training in chemistry. People referred to him as Dr. Schotz, although it is not clear that he had a doctorate. Whatever his background, he created a number of beauty products, including Six-in-One Cold Cream, Dr. Schotz Viennese Cream and a number of fragrances.         But the New Way Laboratory, which he created in 1924, was hardly limited to the needs of the beautiful people. It also produced a poultry-lice killer, a cure for mange, suppositories, a cream that was touted as promoting the building of muscles, a freckle remover and even embalming fluid. Years later, a chemist for Revlon said that although Dr. Schotz's beauty-care products were heavy and ''very old fashioned,'' they were good for their time and effective, especially for dry skin. One of the Schotz products even contained a primitive form of sunscreen.         Estée studied his homemade products closely and, since Dr. Schotz was no businessman, helped him to sell them. Estée said little about her past and it is not clear that she even graduated from Newtown High. But in school or out, she remained fascinated with his beauty aids and was still promoting them in 1930 when she married Joseph Lauter, whom she had been dating for about three years. He was the son of William and Lillian Lauter, who had come to the United States from the part of Austria known as Galicia. Mr. Lauter had tried his hand without much success in both the silk and button businesses. The name was changed to ''Lauder'' later in the decade.         Their marriage foundered and they were divorced in 1939. Their separation lasted until 1942, when Estée told her friends that Mr. Lauder was a very nice man and that ''I don't know why I broke off with him.'' They remarried that December and remained together until his death in 1982.         She is survived by her sons, Leonard A., the chairman of the company, and Ronald S., chairman of Clinique Laboratories; four grandchildren, including William, who will become chief executive of the Estée Lauder Companies on July 1; and six great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Lauder and her husband were apart she met and became close to Mr. van Ameringen, who became president and chairman of International Flavors and Fragrances, a company that formulates fragrances for many well-known beauty houses and has no connection with the Lauder empire. They became lifelong friends and Mr. van Ameringen provided both credit and, some said, product formula for the firm that would bear Mrs. Lauder's name. From the beginning, she was its chief executive and made its most important marketing and product development decisions.         In 1944, the Lauders opened concessions in beauty salons in New York and sold products to out-of-town salons through jobbers. Leonard Lauder, who became president of the company in the 1970's, recalled that ''we had a Boston wholesaler, the Samuel Bernstein Hair Company, and Mr. Bernstein used to talk to me about his son Lenny.''         Mrs. Lauder would go on the road, trying to induce finer stores to feature her merchandise. ''I have the secrets,'' she would tell prospective clients. ''Start the New Year with a new face.''         The concessions were closed in 1946 and gradually the company sold to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. That helped to give her products the prestigious aura they needed for more aggressive marketing.         The introduction of Youth-Dew and Mrs. Lauder's sales expertise combined to take the company from a sales volume of no more than $400 a week to around $5,000 in the early 1950's. It still had no sales staff as such, but it was gaining an image of quality from the department stores in which it was displayed. By 1958, when Leonard joined the company, sales had soared to about $800,000 a year.         The company began to grow more rapidly. In 1965, Mrs. Lauder opened her first beauty ''spa'' in Bloomingdale's New York store. She planned her counters personally and determined that each ''would be a tiny, shining spa -- complete.''         ''I'd make sure the color I chose was the same wonderful 'in between a blue and a green' that whispered elegance, aristocracy, and also complemented bathroom wallpapers,'' she said.         By this time, Estée Lauder was well on her way to becoming the doyenne of beauty and her list of friends began to reflect her regal image. The Duchess of Windsor had long been a friend and now there were others. Princess Grace of Monaco sent her Christmas cards and visited her in New York. Many socially prominent people invited her to their parties, among them the Begum Aga Khan, C. Z. Guest, Nancy Reagan and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. In January 1978, when she received the Legion of Honor, it did not seem to bother the French that Estée Lauder's fragrances were outselling Chanel's by 3 to 1. Gerard Gaussen, the consul general of France, said that she ''represents what we French admire most about Americans -- brains and heart.''         Mrs. Lauder was a generous contributor to civic causes and charities. The Lauder Foundation was set up in the 1960's and it has, among other things, set up three playgrounds in Central Park. The Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies was founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.         It was probably inevitable that such a woman would have her detractors, too. Some said Mrs. Lauder had never adequately compensated John Schotz, who died in the 1960's in modest circumstances at a time when Estée Lauder Inc. was grossing around $14 million a year. Others, according to her biographer, Lee Israel, complained that she denied or played down her Jewishness (Ms. Israel said that Mrs. Lauder told one interviewer that she was half Italian and convent-bred), that she was a name-dropper, a social climber, and not entirely loyal. Ms. Israel quotes an ex-secretary to the duchess of Windsor as complaining that after the duke died and the duchess became infirm, Mrs. Lauder ''deserted'' her.         Unperturbed by the naysayers, Mrs. Lauder lived life vigorously, taking from it what she wanted and rejecting things that would take her away from the people and places she knew. Thus, she rejected President Nixon's offer to make her ambassador to Luxembourg (she blamed her husband, who reportedly said, ''I'm not going to carry her bags'').         In 1982, she demonstrated her approach to life. When she felt that her ruby and diamond tiara clashed horribly with her turquoise dress, she immediately switched to a more suitable gold and diamond crown. ''You know how it is,'' she told Charlotte Curtis of The New York Times. ''You have to wear something.''       
         Joan Richman, a retired executive at CBS News who oversaw the network's early coverage of the Apollo space program with Walter Cronkite, died on Friday at her home in Lumberville, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, Kyle Good, a family friend, said.         A native of St. Louis, Ms. Richman graduated from Wellesley College in 1961.         She was hired the same year to clip newspapers in the research library of CBS News. By 1965, she was a researcher in the special events unit, and in 1968, she became a full producer. She went on to win two Emmy awards for producing Mr. Cronkite's space coverage, one in 1971 for the Apollo 13 and 14 missions, and another, in 1972, for the Apollo 15 mission.         In a statement released by Ms. Richman's family, Mr. Cronkite said that she ''was probably more important than any other individual in shaping the presentation of a new science that gripped the world's imagination.''         From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Richman worked as senior producer for ''The Reasoner Report'' for ABC News, before returning to CBS.         Ms. Richman became executive producer of the weekend editions of the CBS Evening News in 1976, while also producing special events coverage, including the election-night specials in 1976, 1978 and 1980.         In 1981, she was promoted to vice president and director for special events at CBS News, overseeing special coverage of breaking news.         She built her career at CBS News during a time when it was rare for a woman to be a senior media executive. ''It's difficult for the many women thriving in broadcast journalism today to imagine the battles Joan Richman fought and won on their behalf,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, in the statement from the family.         She retired in 1989 to teach at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         She is survived by her sister, Judith R. Saidel of Albany; two nephews, Andrew, of Gaithersburg, Md., and Jonathan, of Albany; a niece, Lisa Saidel, also of Albany; and three grandnieces.       
         Mary McGrory, an unapologetic liberal who chronicled 50 years of scandal, war, Congressional turmoil and political heartbreak as a columnist for The Washington Star and The Washington Post, died on Wednesday at George Washington University Hospital. She was 85.         Ms. McGrory won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1975 for her columns on Watergate. But her career had a remarkable range, from the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, where she first made her name, to the Bush administration and the war with Iraq, which she opposed in her final foreboding columns in March 2003. She suffered a stroke that month and did not return to her column. She had been in declining health ever since, said her nephew, Ted McGrory.         The daughter of a scholarly Boston postal clerk, Ms. McGrory was raised on Latin, poetry and a profoundly Irish love of the game of politics. She covered virtually every presidential campaign since 1956, drawn to their ''endless possibility,'' she once said. Her columns captured some of the greatest political characters of the era -- their loyalty, treachery, weaknesses, sacrifices, high causes and low moments.         She wrote a series of columns about the assassination and funeral of President John F. Kennedy that became one of the most evocative and enduring eulogies for the man and the times.         ''He was just home from the Pacific when I first saw him in 1946,'' she wrote. ''He was thin as a match and still yellow from malaria. But he was blithe and determined and wherever he went he was surrounded by young men who felt with him that the Irish had something more to give to American political life than a last hurrah.''         She was at the airport when Kennedy's body was flown back from Dallas, and she described the tearful, ''leaderless men of the New Frontier'' as they ''picked up their inexpressible burden'' of the young president's coffin. She then wrote a powerfully spare account of his funeral:         ''His old friend, Cardinal Cushing of Boston, who married him, baptized his children and prayed over him in the icy air of his inaugural, said a Low Mass. At the final prayers, after the last blessing, he suddenly added, 'dear Jack.' ''         Across the generations, Ms. McGrory was a fixture on Capitol Hill, summoning House members off the floor for a chat in the speaker's lobby, showing up every Tuesday to grab senators after their weekly party caucuses. She called Congress the ''federal entertainment center,'' and said she vastly preferred it to covering the White House, where ''there are all those courtiers,'' ''so full of themselves,'' who ''may or may not call you back.''         She wrote a column steeped in reporting at a time when other columnists increasingly focused on attitude, analysis and television appearances, and she did her own legwork well into her 80's.         ''I can't do it any other way,'' Ms. McGrory once said. ''I have to see, I have to hear. I'm primitive, I guess. I don't want anyone else doing my listening or watching for me.''         Her second cousin Brian McGrory, a columnist with The Boston Globe, recalled, ''She was hellbent on making sure every column was reported, hellbent on being out on the campaign trail, even when physically it wasn't the easiest thing for her.''         Nothing made her happier, Mr. McGrory added, than being in the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer outside Manchester, N.H., when it functioned as a roiling intelligence center for politicians and journalists covering the New Hampshire primary.         Ms. McGrory was a ground-breaking woman in American newspapers, often the only woman or one of a very few on the campaign trail in her early days. But she played down the notion that this was always, necessarily, a hardship. A woman who increasingly acquired the manner of an aging countess, as her friend Phil Gailey, editor of editorials at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida put it, she was legendary on the campaign trail for enlisting male reporters as her porters.         In his memoir ''A Good Life,'' Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, wrote: ''In the 60's I had been allowed to carry her bags and typewriter during the presidential campaign. We were known as McGrory's bearers.'' Several generations of bearers followed after him.         Her path to political reporting was not easy. A graduate of Boston's elite Girls' Latin School and Emmanuel College, Ms. McGrory got her start as secretary to the book editor of The Boston Herald Traveler. She also wrote book reviews and the kind of features she called ''dog stories,'' but she was ''crazy'' about newspapering and felt stymied, Ms. McGrory said in an oral history for the Washington Press Club Foundation.         She moved to The Washington Star as a book reviewer in 1947. She got her big break in 1954, when her editor, Newbold Noyes, sent her to Capitol Hill to cover the Army-McCarthy hearings. He urged her to write her stories as if she were writing a letter to a favorite aunt. She thought of her Aunt Sarah, ''a very nice, lonely person in our family,'' she said later, and a genre was born. She viewed Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, she said, as ''an Irish bully,'' a type she had seen before.         ''For eight days,'' she wrote in an early column, ''the Army secretary has been having his honesty questioned, his motives impugned and his patriotism challenged. He has been bullied, baited and patronized. He has been treated like a stubborn and not very bright child. Throughout his ordeal, moreover, he has been subjected to the rather jostling familiarity of Senator McCarthy, who calls him 'Bob.' ''         Ms. McGrory went on to cover all the classic Congressional dramas, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. ''Nothing that Bill Clinton did in the matter of Monica Lewinsky shows any class or character,'' she wrote, but added: ''The Republicans are beyond reason. They are like people on New Year's Eve, determined to have a wild time, no matter the cost.''         She was intensely loyal to The Star, and while The Washington Post tried to woo her many times over the years, she did not make the move until The Star closed in 1981. Post editors often joked they were always second best to Ms. McGrory.         In 1998, when accepting the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award, Ms. McGrory described her view of a Mary McGrory column. ''No great men call me,'' she said, proudly. ''You know who calls me? Losers. I am their mark.'' She added, ''If you want to abolish land mines. If you want to reform campaign spending'' or ''if you want to save children from abuse, or stupid laws, or thickheaded judges, you have my telephone number.''         ''All the places of little hope, that's my constituency,'' she said.         The Vietnam War was her great passion, and it framed her coverage of the 1968 presidential campaign, particularly the insurgent antiwar candidacy of Eugene J. McCarthy. But she ranged widely, with judgments that were often withering. Senator Edward M. Kennedy said ruefully, ''As Bobby once said, 'Mary is so gentle until she gets behind a typewriter.' ''         In a column about Richard M. Nixon's 1962 news conference after he lost the California governor's race, Ms. McGrory wrote: ''For Richard M. Nixon, it was exit snarling.'' She later made the Nixon administration's famous enemies list.         Ms. McGrory did not marry or have children, but had a large extended family, including two nieces, in addition to her nephew; a loyal group of Washington Star veterans; and a longtime relationship as the ultimate volunteer with St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home.         She was also a hostess of some renown. Mr. Gailey remembers one McGrory party in 1982, a christening for his son, that featured Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. singing, ''If you're Irish, come into the parlor,'' while a Reagan White House aide, Michael K. Deaver, accompanied him on the piano.         When she accepted her press club award in 1998, Ms. McGrory declared, ''I should confess that I always felt a little sorry for people who didn't work for newspapers.''       
         Carolyn Lelyveld, who directed a pioneering Bronx day care center for children with AIDS from the poorest neighborhoods and founded programs for children with cancer in hospitals in South Africa under apartheid, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death resulted from complications of breast cancer, said her husband, Joseph Lelyveld, former executive editor of The New York Times.         Ms. Lelyveld's work with AIDS children, at Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, took place from 1987-94. The center was the only one in the city. Its children were picked up by bus each school day, and the center maintained a food pantry for their families, mostly single-parent households headed by women with AIDS.         Earlier Ms. Lelyveld directed day care centers in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and on Capitol Hill in Washington. She then joined programs that prepared children for difficult medical procedures and attended to their nonmedical needs, first at Downstate Medical Center and then at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.         From 1981-83, she founded parallel programs for children with cancer at Baragwanath Hospital in the township of Soweto, the largest black hospital in South Africa at the time, and at a white hospital, Johannesburg General. Embraced by black nurses, the Soweto program continued for some years.         Born in New York, Ms. Lelyveld attended Brandeis University and graduated from the School of General Studies at Columbia. She earned a master's degree at the Bank Street College of Education.         For a decade, until last summer, Ms. Lelyveld coordinated a project for The New York Times Company Foundation to enrich the resources of Public School 111, the Adolph S. Ochs School, on the West Side of Manhattan. Her work greatly expanded the library and put pupils into continuing contact with leading cultural institutions, including the American Museum of Natural History and the International Center of Photography.         Besides her husband, Ms. Lelyveld is survived by her daughters, Amy Lelyveld of New York and Nita Lelyveld of Los Angeles; one granddaughter; and her sisters, Susan Mermelstein of Newton, Mass., and Annie Fox of Brooklyn.       
         Anne Gorsuch Burford, a Colorado conservative who was chosen by President Ronald Reagan as his top environmental regulator only to resign under Congressional fire 22 months later, died Sunday in Aurora, Colo. She was 62.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Stephanie Gorsuch of Denver, said.         In appointing her administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, President Reagan made Ms. Burford a leader in his effort to bring economic discipline to environmental cleanup and to give the states greater enforcement powers on matters like clean air and water, policies she had earlier advocated on the state level. Critics contended that the policies weakened federal environmental enforcement to please polluting industries.         This fundamental difference in perspective reached a climax in a battle between a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, which demanded thousands of pages of documents relating to toxic waste cleanup, and Ms. Burford, who refused to hand them over. She said she would go to jail rather than surrender them to Congress.         Eventually, the White House gave up its claim of executive privilege to keep the documents secret, and Ms. Burford resigned on March 9, 1983.         In her tenure as the second-ranking woman in the Reagan administration, after the United Nations Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Ms. Burford showed sharp intelligence, as well as a taste for confrontation with environmental groups.         Environmentalists like Gaylord Nelson, chairman of the Wilderness Society, accused her of ''a wholesale dismantling'' of environmental advances, but Ms. Burford insisted that she was bringing cost-effective market forces to the regulation of pollution.         Anne Irene McGill was born on April 21, 1942, in Casper, Wyo. Her father, a surgeon, moved the family to Denver when she was an infant.         She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in two years and finished law school there at 20, then became the youngest woman admitted to the Colorado bar. She used a Fulbright scholarship to study criminal law in India.         She worked for a bank and then as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson County, Colo., and as deputy district attorney for the City of Denver. After working at two state regulatory agencies, she became a lawyer for Mountain Bell Telephone.         In 1976, she was elected to the first of two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of a group that called itself the Crazies for its members' passionate devotion to states' rights and opposition to federal energy and environmental policies. She was named outstanding freshman legislator and worked on legislation concerning hazardous wastes and vehicle emissions.         In 1964, she married David Gorsuch, whom she divorced in 1982. The next year, she married Robert Burford, a rancher who was then head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. He died in 1993, while divorce proceedings were in progress. Ms. Burford returned to private law practice after her resignation.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her sons, J.J. Gorsuch of Denver and Neil Gorsuch of Vienna, Va.; her mother, Dorothy McGill of Denver; her sisters, Mary Edwards of Severna Park, Md., Theresa Peace of Lincoln, Neb., Dorothy McGill of El Paso, Tex., Veronica Urban of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Rosie Binger of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, Joe McGill of Plano, Tex.; and four grandchildren.         James Watt, who became Mr. Reagan's interior secretary, and James Coors, the Colorado brewing and energy magnate, sponsored Ms. Burford for the E.P.A. post. Her confirmation was held up for months as senators debated her qualifications and questioned her agenda, but the outcome was never in serious doubt.         When her nomination hearing was finally held on May 1, 1981, she began by speaking lyrically of her own environment.         ''As a long-term Coloradan,'' she said, ''I come before you with a deep appreciation of the unique beauties which we enjoy in our environment -- the majesty and grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the openness and sense of space of our eastern plains.''       
         Helen K. Copley, former publisher of The San Diego Union-Tribune and its predecessors and a prominent philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the newspaper said.         Mrs. Copley began working at the Union Tribune Publishing Company as a secretary in 1953. She became the publisher in 1973, taking the position after the death of her husband, James S. Copley. She retired in 2001.         Until 1992, the company's two flagship newspapers, The San Diego Union and its afternoon sister paper, The San Diego Tribune, were the major competing papers in the city. Responding to declining circulation numbers and a drop in advertising, Mrs. Copley merged the two papers into The Union-Tribune, a morning paper. It is now the third-largest newspaper in California, with a daily circulation of 355,000. The Sunday circulation is 445,000.         As the population grew in San Diego, Mrs. Copley dealt with growing competition from smaller papers and a regional edition of The Los Angeles Times. In her first years as publisher, she sought to meet with all 1,500 employees of the company in small groups in an effort to improve morale. Under her tenure, The San Diego Tribune won two Pulitzer prizes.         Copley Press Inc., which owns the Union-Tribune Publishing Company, publishes eight other daily newspapers, in California, Illinois and Ohio. Keeping Copley Press in family hands was a priority for Mrs. Copley, and she turned it over to her son, David C. Copley, when she retired.         Margaret Helen Kinney was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Nov. 28, 1922. After a stint in the Waves in the 1940's and a brief marriage, she moved to San Diego with her mother in 1951.         In 1953, Mrs. Copley answered an ad for a job at the Union Tribune Publishing Company. She began working as a secretary for Mr. Copley, who had become chief executive of Copley Press after the death of his father, Ira C. Copley, who started the company in 1905. In 1965, she married Mr. Copley; eight years later, he died of brain cancer.         Mrs. Copley, whose worth was estimated to be $960 million by Forbes magazine last year, gave millions to the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. She also underwrote the construction of a library at the University of San Diego.         In addition to her son, David, of La Jolla, Mrs. Copley's survivors include a sister, Mary Frances Davison of Santa Maria, Calif.; a brother, Frank E. Kinney of Cedar Rapids; and two stepchildren from her husband's first marriage, Michael Copley of San Diego and Janice Obre of New York.       
         THE ''puppet'' scuttlebutt -- that her latest career move has strings attached and that she's not the person pulling them -- rankles Louise Mirrer. Hence that furrow in the brow of the otherwise self-possessed president of the New-York Historical Society, who is inaugurating her tenure with a $5 million blockbuster exhibition on Alexander Hamilton, a founding father hitherto best known for decorating $10 bills with his somber visage.         According to some historians, Ms. Mirrer is allowing conservative board members to push the society into showcasing national history at the expense of the city's, and kicking it all off with a tribute to Hamilton, a conservative icon. But according to her, Hamilton is underappreciated, and she is getting a bum rap for steering the society from venerable stagnation into 21st-century relevance.         ''For one thing, the people doing the complaining are not the decision-makers at this institution,'' she says, spoiling the hush in her third-floor office. ''The society was too narrowly focused. Really, the new mission is like the old mission. The original mission 200 years ago was to focus in all ways possible on American history first, and then on history in New York State.''         Her books (she was a medievalist in her academic days) are not yet unpacked, but the Oriental carpet and artwork -- including a Klimt-inspired portrait of Ms. Mirrer's ''inner spirit'' by a Dominican artist, Jorge Severino, who painted her as a white-gowned and regal black woman -- lend a rich ambience. ''Maybe it's my ego, but I don't want to preside over an institution that puts on exhibitions that have limited popular appeal,'' she says. ''If there's a small exhibit that has merit, fine, do it somewhere, but not on Central Park West! I personally would not want to see this institution become an inconsequential institution.''         Next up after Hamilton, she's mounting another blockbuster, ''From Bondage to Freedom,'' a $2 million overhauled version of the society's original $50,000 exhibition on slavery, which did not, in her opinion, make enough of an impression. No pizzazz. No revelatory narrative.         Next February she has planned an Audubon exhibition for birders, and others, to die for: taxidermy, artwork, avian surround-sound. Then there's a First Ladies exhibition that will -- listen up, critics of Ms. Mirrer's ''big picture'' machinations -- be New York City-centric. Her board, she admits, smiled benevolently about the Audubon show and has not yet signed off on First Ladies. But she is confident they will. ''This is not a fractured board,'' she notes, a touch defensively.         With full panache intact at 51 -- her black skirt is short, her patent heels are high, her blue Hermès scarf is, like that 600-pound granite gargoyle on a corner pedestal, a gift from colleagues at the City University of New York, where she was executive vice chancellor -- Ms. Mirrer is an avowed fan of blockbusters on a national scale. This is no time, she says, for the society to do the museum equivalent of contemplating its navel, or the city's, though the focus on the latter was an inarguable strength of her predecessor, Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian.         But she is adamant that the society is not compromising its integrity by supporting a blockbuster-friendly agenda endorsed by two deep-pocketed additions to its board, Richard Gilder and Lewis E. Lehrman, both Republicans. And she insists that the loan to the society of historic documents owned by Mr. Lehrman and Mr. Gilder -- a co-chairman of the search committee that recruited her -- has not unduly influenced curatorial decisions. Sure, she wants their documents at her institution, especially after $1 million was spent on a vault for them. But the entire board, she says, endorsed the Hamilton exhibit: the proof is the $5 million raised for it since her arrival in June.         THE exhibition will sponsor a few private receptions during the Republican National Convention before opening to the public, but Ms. Mirrer denies that the society's agenda is partisan: ''I don't see this as a place that nurtures one view of history at the expense of another,'' she says. Translation: Mr. Gilder is not controlling policy.         Besides, Ms. Mirrer, unlike her benefactor, is a Democrat. ''I don't think he even knows,'' she says.         She grew up in Great Neck, on Long Island, where her father was an internist and her mother a historian and educator. Even her grandmother was a college graduate. Ms. Mirrer was a pre-med major at the University of Pennsylvania until a curriculum requirement -- a history course -- changed her trajectory. On her mother's advice, she opted for a medieval history course, then switched academic gears. She received a linguistics degree from Cambridge and a doctorate at Stanford and came to CUNY, where she supervised a revamping of the admissions policy, from the University of Minnesota. Her second marriage, to the University of California, Los Angeles, sociologist, David Halle, is on commuter terms: neither wished to become ''a faculty spouse.''         She lives on Beekman Place with two of her three children -- both attend public schools -- and, despite seeing her husband only on weekends, makes time for Saturday-morning tennis with another female executive, Kathryn Wylde, who heads the Partnership for New York City.         So they're doubles partners? Ms. Mirrer frowns. ''Singles; we're way too competitive for doubles.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Lenore Benson, a former executive director of the Fashion Group International, died on Wednesday at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. She was 80.         From 1984 to 1993, Ms. Benson directed the Fashion Group, a 6,000-member organization that promotes the advancement of women in the fashion industry.         During that time, she inaugurated an annual Night of Stars awards dinner honoring outstanding designers, retailers and fashion icons and expanded the group's activities to include seminars and workshops.         Until several weeks ago, she had been at work developing an archival program for the group, in partnership with the New York Public Library. So far, the program has cataloged more than 600,000 fashion slides dating from the 1950's to the present.         From November 2001 until last June, Ms. Benson was the director of external affairs for the Laboratory Institute of Merchandising, a professional school in New York.         Ms. Benson, who was born in Cleveland and raised in Minneapolis, was the only daughter of Charles Benson, a specialty store executive, and his wife, Eleanor.         Ms. Benson came to New York in 1947 and worked for eight years for the Fifth Avenue store Franklin Simon.         In 1955, she became merchandise and marketing director of Mademoiselle magazine, and later Harper's Bazaar and then Vogue, before accepting a position with the Fashion Group.         Ms. Benson leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Jessie V. Stone, a philanthropist who was the widow of W. Clement Stone, the insurance magnate known for his optimistic books and speeches on success, died on Sept. 3 at her home in Winnetka, Ill. She was 100.         Mrs. Stone's death, exactly two years after her husband's, was announced by their son, Norman.         Mrs. Stone was a founder and board member of the W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation, which makes grants for education and child development. The foundation, financed entirely by Mr. and Mrs. Stone's contributions, has donated more than $200 million, said Sandra Treacy, its executive director.         Jessie Verna Tarson was born in Chicago on Oct. 30, 1903, and became a longtime advocate of volunteerism. She was the first president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Robert R. McCormick Boys Club (now the Boys and Girls Club) in Chicago and volunteered for decades at the Chicago Maternity Center. She later worked with a group now known as Prevent Child Abuse America, created by her daughter, Donna J. Stone, who died in 1985.         In addition to her son, a psychologist who serves as the foundation's president, Mrs. Stone is survived by 12 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. An older son, Clement, died in 1986.       
         Caroline Lerner Goldsmith, a public relations executive specializing in the visual arts and a founder of influential arts organizations, died on Oct. 2 at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was metastatic melanoma, said her husband, John Frank Goldsmith.         Interested in art from childhood, Ms. Goldsmith and a small group of other women established ArtTable Inc. in 1980 to help women who were professionally involved in the arts to meet and network. It now has a national roster of members, with chapters in many American cities. She was executive director for its first 15 years and remained on the board until her death.         Earlier, in 1960, she formed Gallery Passport, with a New York lawyer, Helene F. Kaplan. It was one of the first enterprises to conduct guided tours of museums and galleries, now a common practice.         From 1966 until her death, Ms. Goldsmith was an executive with Ruder Finn Arts and Communications Counselors, a division of the international public relations agency Ruder & Finn that is active in promoting business support for the arts. She worked on art projects for corporate clients like Time Inc., now AOL Time Warner, American Express and the Philip Morris companies, now Altria.         While at Ruder Finn, she organized a comprehensive show of work by African-American artists that toured nationally and commissioned a film in 1985 about the installation of 25 monumental Henry Moore sculptures in New York City parks. She also conceived an exhibition, ''Frontier America: The Far West,'' organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which traveled to museums in the United States and Europe in 1975 and 1976.         She was born Caroline Steinholz on Nov. 12, 1925, in Manhattan. She graduated from Cornell University in 1946.         Besides her husband, her survivors include a son, David Lerner of New York, from an earlier marriage to Mortimer Lerner, and three stepchildren, Kate Paradise of Boston, Elizabeth Hilton of Chicago and John F. Goldsmith Jr. of Plainfield, Ill..       
         Lynn Manulis, a retailer of luxury fashion who dressed a generation of the world's most socially prominent women in classic style while attiring their daughters in the work of bold young designers whose reputations she helped make, died on Sunday in Lantana, Fla.         She was 85. A resident of Lantana, she had lived in Palm Beach for many years. Ms. Manulis died after having been ill with lung cancer, her daughter, Nancy Glick, said.         Until her retirement last year, Ms. Manulis was president and chief executive of Martha Inc., the chain of boutiques founded by her mother, Martha Phillips. The flagship store, Martha, was on Park Avenue near 58th Street in Manhattan; there were also stores in Trump Tower and in Palm Beach and Bal Harbour, Fla.         Ms. Manulis (MAN-you-liss), whom almost everyone called Miss Lynn, and her mother, known as Miss Martha, were for decades ''the doyennes of haute couture in America,'' The New York Times wrote in 1992. Mrs. Phillips died in 1996 at 98.         While her mother dressed a constellation of boldface names in evening gowns by Halston, Geoffrey Beene, Pauline Trigère and Oscar de la Renta, Ms. Manulis sought to attract younger clients. In 1989, she opened a shop, Martha International, where she showcased the work of emerging talents like Zang Toi, Charlotte Neuville, Gemma Kahng and Christian Francis Roth.         Among the garments there, The Times reported, were ''a strapless cotton dress with an appliquéd shark curving around the body, a sequined race driver's jacket studded with sports-car emblems'' and ''an orange blanket coat dripping giant fringes.''         Lynn Phillips was born on Dec. 28, 1918, in Brooklyn. She studied acting with Stella Adler, and in 1942 appeared in the play ''Angel Street.'' In 1944, she married Robert Burnstine; the couple were divorced in 1954.         After her divorce, Ms. Manulis joined her mother's business; she married Fred Manulis, a physician, in 1960. Dr. Manulis died in 1989. She is survived by two children from her first marriage, her daughter, of Washington, and a son, Andrew Burnstine, of Plantation, Fla.         Martha Inc. thrived in the 1980's, with sales of more than $40 million in 1987, The Times reported. But the stock market crash of 1987 and the recession that followed put an end to the demand for the kind of goods that made the names of Ms. Manulis and her mother. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1992, closing its five stores.         ''I was selling original couture dresses -- $20,000, $30,000 -- and nobody asked me the price,'' Ms. Manulis recalled in 1996. ''In the blink of an eye everyone pulled back.''         In 1995, mother and daughter opened Martha Phillips, which sold less-expensive clothing, in Palm Beach. That store closed last year.       
         Carol Mezzacappa, a dancer and choreographer who staged many works by the modern-dance pioneer Charles Weidman, died on Oct. 12 in a hospice in Brooklyn, where she lived. She was 47.         The cause was brain cancer, according to an announcement from the Charles Weidman Foundation.         Ms. Mezzacappa was president of the foundation and the artistic and executive director of Dance Consort: Mezzacappa-Gabrian, a company she founded with her husband, the dancer Craig Gabrian.         The dance idiom developed by Doris Humphrey and Weidman in 1928 after they left Denishawn, the company that spawned other pioneers like Martha Graham, remained at the heart of Ms. Mezzacappa's performances. Writing in The New York Times in 1994, Jennifer Dunning praised the ''playful, robust'' style of Dance Consort in Weidman's ''Brahms Waltzes.''         Both Dance Consort and its junior troupe in Brooklyn, Young Dancers in Repertory, were devoted to Weidman's movement principles and the presentation of his works.         Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Mezzacappa studied the Humphrey-Weidman technique with Weidman, Nona Schurman, Peter Hamilton and Ernestine Stodelle. A graduate of Brooklyn College, Ms. Mezzacappa brought her expertise in staging Weidman works to theaters in New York and to colleges and dance programs.         She is survived by her husband; her parents, Beatrice and Michael Mezzacappa; and her sister, Diane Alvaro.       
         Judy Corman, a publishing executive who helped bring to life the global dynamo named Harry Potter, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 66.The cause was complications of cancer, her husband, the novelist Avery Corman, said.         Ms. Corman was senior vice president of corporate communications at Scholastic, the United States publisher of J.K. Rowling's wildly successful fantasy series. She joined the company in 1999, the year Book 3, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' appeared. It was the first book in the series to be published in the United States and Britain in the same year.         With that book, the Potter public-relations machine began to hum with a level of intensity and inventiveness rarely seen in children's publishing. Working with Kris Moran, Scholastic's director of trade-book publicity, Ms. Corman orchestrated suspense -- and desire -- in an international campaign that has continued through Books 4 and 5.         In an unheard-of measure for a children's title, Book 4, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' was tightly embargoed before its publication in 2000. Even reviewers could not get advance copies. The embargo was lifted at midnight on the day of publication, with buyers lined up for hours outside bookstores throughout the English-speaking world.         Last year, to herald the publication of Book 5, ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' the first copy, inscribed by the author, was delivered by armored car to the New York Public Library. Worldwide sales of Ms. Rowling's books totaled 250 million in 2003, according to the reference series ''Contemporary Authors.''         Judith Ann Lishinsky was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 17, 1938. She began her career at Epic Records, where she publicized the music of Miles Davis, Willie Nelson and John Denver. She was later public relations director for Phoenix House, the drug-rehabilitation agency, and a senior vice president at Robinson, Lerer & Montgomery, a New York public relations firm.         Besides her husband, the author of ''Kramer vs. Kramer,'' Ms. Corman is survived by her parents, Ben and Roslyn Lishinsky of Delray Beach, Fla.; two brothers, Michael Lishinsky of Williams, Ore., and Howard Lishinsky of Metuchen, N.J.; and two sons, Nicholas, of Manhattan, and Matthew, of Los Angeles.
