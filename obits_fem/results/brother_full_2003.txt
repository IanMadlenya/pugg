         Nell Carter, the robustly sassy singer and actress who exploded onto the New York musical stage in the Fats Waller revue ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and went on to become a popular television star in the series ''Gimme a Break!,'' died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 54.         Ms. Carter collapsed and was found by one of her sons, said her spokesman, Roger Lane. She had been in rehearsals for ''Raisin,'' a musical adaptation of the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' at a theater in Long Beach, Calif. A diabetic, Ms. Carter survived two brain aneurysms in 1992.         Although she stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall, she was a larger-than-life stage personality who never did things in half-measures. Along with Patti La Belle and Jennifer Holliday, she belonged to a select circle of theatrical pop-soul belters whose members reveled in high-powered vocal flamboyance. A typical performance by Ms. Carter reached into the fabric of a song and tore out its seams with feral flourishes.         As a singer and stage personality, Ms. Carter was also a natural comedian. Her vocal style was descended from the humorous gutbucket blues of Bessie Smith by way of Dinah Washington, whose singing also conveyed a seam of earthy amusement. The warmth and feeling for comedy that inflected her interpretations of even the saddest songs reflected Ms. Carter's desire to be what she called ''Judy Garland without the tragedy.''         For many, Ms. Carter's performances of songs like ''Honeysuckle Rose'' and ''Mean to Me'' were legendary. That show, a potpourri of mostly Fats Waller pieces, opened at the Manhattan Theater Club in February 1978, and moved to the Longacre Theater on Broadway three months later, running there for more than 1,600 performances. Ms. Carter won a Tony for best featured actress in that musical.         Three years later she won an Emmy for the NBC television production of the same show. Ms. Carter made such an indelible impression as a shimmying, bawdy old-time vaudevillian in ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' that she often found herself typecast as a rollicking good-time mama.         Her biggest success after ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the sitcom ''Gimme a Break!,'' in which she played Miss Nellie Ruth ''Nell'' Harper, the housekeeper and surrogate mother for a widowed California police chief and his three children. The show, which ran from 1981 to 1987, earned her two Emmy nominations and revived the archetype of the mammy, an African-American woman caring for a white family.         Nell Carter was born Nell Hardy in Birmingham, Ala., on Sept. 13, 1948. While growing up, she absorbed her mother's recordings of Dinah Washington and B. B. King, along with her brother's Elvis Presley records. As a child, she sang on the gospel circuit and performed on a weekly radio show, ''The Y Teens.'' Later she sang in local coffeehouses.         Moving to New York at 19, she studied acting and performed in nightclubs like Reno Sweeney, the Village Gate, Dangerfield's, the Apartment and the Rainbow Room. ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the springboard to a wide-ranging singing and acting career.         Her television credits ranged from a role on the soap opera ''Ryan's Hope'' to an appearance on the acclaimed PBS special ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' to game-show contestant on ''Match Game.'' Her theater credits include ''Hello Dolly!,'' ''Hair,'' ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         She had film roles in ''The Grass Harp'' (1995) and ''The Proprietor'' (1996).         Married and divorced twice, Ms. Carter is survived by a daughter, Tracy, and by two sons, Joshua and Daniel.       
         Eve Stillman, a retired lingerie designer who also owned and led the lingerie company that bore her name, died on Friday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 97.         In the 1940's when Gracette Lingerie, a company founded by her husband, Harry Stillman, encountered financial problems, she intervened and helped shift the company to higher-priced products.         In 1956 she changed the company's name to Eve Stillman, and later it became Eve Stillman Inc.         Its products included hand-embroidered nightgowns, and it had particular success with horsehair petticoats for the full-skirted fashions of the 1950's.         In 1981, she received a Femmy award from Intimate Apparel Industry, a trade group for lingerie makers.         When she retired in 1989 most of the assets of her company were sold and became a division of Kefco Industries.         Eve Feinberg was born in Upper Manhattan and attended Hunter College.         Her husband died in 1979 after 44 years of marriage.         She is survived by her twin sister, Bertha Freeman of Miami; a brother, David Feinberg of West Palm Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Frances Linderman of Trinidad, Calif.; and two grandchildren.       
         Lillian Nadel Gerard, who was active in exhibiting and marketing foreign films in the United States for three decades, died last Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The cause was complications of cancer, her husband, Philip R. Gerard, said.         After she was hired in 1936 by an American importer of foreign films, she did publicity and advertising for ''The Eternal Mask,'' a film produced in Switzerland.         As she recalled in 1985, ''That picture launched my debut in foreign films, and through my hands passed films of every origin in every genre, films that are now classics: 'Grand Illusion,' 'Pépé le Moko,' 'Children of Paradise,' 'The Seventh Seal' and many others, including a revival of Chaplin's 'City Lights.' ''         Over the years, she was an executive of the Paris Theater in Manhattan and a consultant to the Rugoff Theaters, the Little Carnegie and the Fifth Avenue Cinema. She also worked with independent film importers.         In 1950, as the Paris Theater's managing director, she protested the banning by New York City's Department of Licenses of the film ''The Miracle'' as ''blasphemous'' while it was being shown at the Paris.         She also worked on special projects at the Museum of Modern Art.         A Bronx native, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Bernard Baruch College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard; a daughter, Jennifer Gerard Maric; three grandchildren; and a brother, Irwin.       
         Baroness Liliane de Rothschild, the wife of Baron Elie de Rothschild, an art collector, philanthropist and meticulous caretaker of the history of the family she married into, died on Feb. 17 in her home in Royaumont, outside Paris. She was 86.         Her husband, a member of the French branch of the Rothschilds, was a skilled polo player and is reputedly the family's foremost wine connoisseur and a widely knowledgeable collector of art. But as much as the baron exemplifies the family's grand style, he once said his wife was the family member most steeped in family history, tradition and élan.         In Derek Wilson's book ''Rothschild: the Wealth and Power of a Dynasty,'' the baron said his wife was more Rothschild than the Rothschilds.         Liliane Fould-Springer was born on May 11, 1916. She was part of a rival French financial family, a great-niece of Achille Fould, the rival of James Rothschild in the mid-19th century. Mr. Fould's financial house, Crédit Mobilier, had threatened to smash the Rothschild supremacy, but in the end lost out to the family.         The Rothschilds were childhood sweethearts and became engaged before World War II. Baron Elie and his brother, Alain, were serving at the front when Germany overran France in 1940. Both were captured and ended up in Colditz Castle, the Germans' most secure prison, after separate escape attempts.         Baron Elie wrote to Miss Fould-Springer and proposed that they marry by proxy. Her parents were opposed to the idea, pointing out that it was not helpful to bear the name Rothschild with the Gestapo swarming over France.         But Liliane agreed. Wedding ceremonies took place many months apart, with Baron Elie giving his pledge at Colditz on Oct. 7, 1941, and Miss Fould-Springer giving hers at Cannes on April 7, 1942.         After the war, her husband ran Chateau Lafite, one of the family vineyards. Chateau Mouton, long owned by Philippe de Rothschild, is equally famous. The vineyards have been rivals since 1855, ever since Lafite was classified as premier cru, or first category, and Mouton as only second. Mouton achieved the long-sought first category in 1973.         The vineyard rivalry sometimes approached bitterness. But when Philippe's daughter, Philippine, was to be married in 1961, Liliane de Rothschild fulfilled her frequent role of unifying the family. In the face of Philippe's heated campaign to burnish Mouton's allure, Baroness de Rothschild staged the wedding in the vaulted cellars of Lafite.         ''Here all lifted glasses to the bride, to groom, to both Rothschild vineyards, and to Liliane, the hostess,'' Frederic Morton wrote in ''The Rothschilds: A Family Portrait.''         Baroness de Rothschild was a frequent presence in the world of haute couture. The designer Balenciaga made a doll for her, depicting one of her daughters at the age of 9.         She was also important in the art world, particularly as a recognized expert on 18th-century art. Part of her role, according to the Morton book, was organizing the vast art purchases her husband made.         But sometimes she made her own purchases. The New York Times in 1999 reported her vigorous bidding on several items, including a German clock case from around 1550, that another branch of the Rothschilds was auctioning off. She paid $148,105 for items expected to sell for $16,000 at most.         Her social circle included the expected royalty and celebrities, like her friend Greta Garbo, whom she called ''the loveliest woman you or I ever saw or will see,'' but she preferred that they be interesting people.         The baroness is survived by her husband; two daughters, Nellie Munthe of London and Elisabeth of Paris; a son, Nathaniel of New York City; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         She was famed for both her worldly wit and her great composure. Christopher Ogden, in his book ''Life of the Party: The Biography of Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman,'' told of the evening in 1954, when the baroness was seated at a dinner next to the Duke of Windsor.         He turned to her and asked, ''Which Rothschild is the lover of Pamela Churchill?''         ''My husband, sir,'' the baroness replied.       
         Amanda Davis, a promising writer whose first novel appeared in bookstores on Feb. 18, died on Friday when the small plane that was taking her on a publicity tour crashed into a mountain 18 miles from Asheville, N.C. She was 32 and lived in Oakland, Calif.         Her father, Dr. James Davis, who was piloting the plane, a Cessna 177 Cardinal, and her mother, Francie Davis, both of Setauket, N.Y., were also killed.         Her novel, ''Wonder When You'll Miss Me,'' was published by William Morrow. In its first-person narrative a young woman, Faith Duckle, makes a difficult journey from schoolyard outcast to trapeze artist in a circus. Ms. Davis traveled with a circus to do research for the book.         Her other writings include ''Circling the Drain'' (1999, Morrow/Avon), a collection of 15 short stories, mostly concerning young women dealing with loss.         When she died, she was an assistant professor at Mills College, in Oakland, where she taught fiction-writing to undergraduates and graduate students. She received a bachelor's degree in theater from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and a master's degree in fiction from Brooklyn College.         Her father, who was 63, was chairman of the neurology department at Stony Brook University Medical School in Stony Brook, N.Y. Her mother, 59, was an assistant professor and the chief librarian at Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y.         Ms. Davis was born in Durham, N.C., her family's longtime hometown.         She is survived by a sister, Joanna Maure Davis, of San Francisco, and a brother, Adam, of Lancaster, Pa.       
         Ella King Torrey, former president of the San Francisco Art Institute and an innovative arts administrator, died Wednesday at her home in San Francisco. She was 45.         Her family did not disclose the cause of death.         Ms. Torrey, who was called by both her first and middle names, and was the fifth-generation Ella King in her family, was inspired most of her life by the importance of individual artists and grass-roots artistic collaborations. She pursued this interest in several ways, from organizing exhibitions and writing to frequently participating on panels for the National Endowment for the Arts.         ''Her whole focus was creating opportunities for artists,'' said John Killacky, an officer at the San Francisco Foundation. ''In every situation, she was an animator, a cultural animator.''         Ms. Torrey was born in 1957 in Bronxville, N.Y., and grew up in Evansville, Ind., and Philadelphia. She graduated cum laude in 1980 from Yale University, where she majored in art history and wrote her senior essay on the effect of Barbie dolls on popular culture. Her interest in contemporary folk art took her to the University of Mississippi, where she wrote her master's thesis on Theora Hamblett, a little-known visionary folk painter, and became deeply involved with black quilt-makers. She was charter president of Afro-American Quilters Inc., a nonprofit cooperative in Oxford, Miss.         In 1985, she became a program officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia, where her projects included rehabilitating buildings for artists' subsidized housing. Pushing the Pew to support individual artists as well as institutions, she founded and headed the Pew Artists Fellowship Program, which awards 12 $50,000 grants to artists annually.         Ms. Torrey became president of the San Francisco Art Institute in 1995, when it was in physical and financial disarray. Widely credited with raising this art school's national and international profile, she more than tripled its endowment, oversaw the renovation and expansion of its landmark building, added several new trustees, re-established its visiting artists' program and also established an exchange program with Oxford University.         In early 2001, an auditing firm found irregularities in the way the institute's chief financial officer and comptroller had been keeping its books. In April 2002, Ms. Torrey resigned. ''I felt I had accomplished much of what I set out to do,'' she told The San Francisco Chronicle. Several board members then resigned in protest.         Ms. Torrey is survived by her mother, Ella Russell Torrey of Philadelphia; a sister, Elizabeth L. Torrey of Washington; and a brother, L. Russell Torrey of Villanova, Pa.         Correction:  May 17, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on May 3 about Ella King Torrey, a former president of the San Francisco Art Institute, misstated its fiscal situation in 1995, when she took the post. While the institute had often run a deficit, sometimes amounting to half its annual budget, it had begun to reduce deficits since the mid-1980's and to address many of its structural problems. It was not in financial or physical disarray.       
         Janet Collins, prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House in the early 1950's and one of a very few black women to become prominent in American classical ballet, died on Wednesday in Fort Worth. She was 86 and lived there.         Ms. Collins taught dance, choreographed, performed on Broadway and in film and appeared frequently on television. But she was best known as the exquisitely beautiful dancer who was the first black artist to perform at the Metropolitan, four years before Marian Anderson sang there.         ''She was a great inspiration to me as a child in Trinidad,'' the dancer and painter Geoffrey Holder said. ''What she did by dancing the way she did -- to be prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House -- gave everybody hope.''         Ms. Collins made her New York debut in 1949, dancing in her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street Y. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described her as ''the most exciting young dancer who has flashed across the current scene in a long time,'' calling her style an eclectic mix of modern dance and ballet.         ''There is a wonderful sense of aliveness in the dancer's presence and in her moving,'' Martin wrote. ''She is not self-absorbed, but is dancing completely and wholesouledly for an audience. On the other hand, there is no air of showing off about it, no coyness or coquetry, but only an apparent desire to establish and maintain a communicative contact.'' He praised her for the sharp, clean precision, ''the piquant tang, the arresting mental vigor'' of her dancing and choreography.         Ms. Collins's next triumph came the following year on Broadway in the Cole Porter musical ''Out of This World.'' Playing the role of Night, she danced an airborne solo created for her by Hanya Holm. She went from there to the Metropolitan, where she appeared as a principal dancer.         She performed lead roles in ''Aida,'' ''Carmen,'' the Dance of the Hours in ''La Gioconda'' and the Bacchanale in ''Samson and Delilah.''         It was not until two decades after she left the Met, however, that she was to receive major attention again in New York when, in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance.         Born in New Orleans, Ms. Collins moved with her family to Los Angeles at age 4.         She received her first dance training at a Catholic community center and went on to study primarily with Carmelita Maracci, one of the few ballet teachers who accepted black students, and with Lester Horton and Adolph Bolm.         She auditioned in Los Angeles for the Ballet Russe but said she had been told that she would either have to have special roles created for her or dance in white face.         ''I said no,'' she told Anna Kisselgoff in a 1974 interview in The Times. ''I sat on the steps and I cried and cried.'' But the rejection spurred her, she said, to work even harder, hard enough to be an exception.         Ms. Collins danced with Katherine Dunham and performed with the Dunham company in the 1943 film musical ''Stormy Weather.''         She also danced a solo choreographed by Jack Cole in the 1946 film ''The Thrill of Brazil,'' and worked with the filmmaker Maya Deren.         She toured with Talley Beatty in a nightclub act that was sometimes billed as Rea and Rico De Gard to prevent speculation about the two light-skinned dancers' race.         Ms. Collins was most active during the 1950's, when she toured with her own dance group throughout the United States and Canada and taught at academies including the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet; Harkness House; and the San Francisco Ballet School.         Ms. Collins is survived by a brother, Earnest, of Fort Worth, and a sister, Betty Wilkerson of Pasadena, Calif.         Correction:  June 7, 2003, Saturday  An obituary last Saturday about Janet Collins, a former prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House, misstated the precedent for black artists there. Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and several other performers at a jazz concert in 1944 were the first; Ms. Collins first appeared in 1951.       
         Martha Scott, who created the role of the sweet, ethereal Emily in the original Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' and was nominated for an Oscar for repeating it in the film version, died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Scott's trademark was warm sincerity in an era when glamour-girl artificiality reigned. She appeared in more than 20 movies, at least that many Broadway productions and a variety of television shows. She also produced plays and movies.         She loved to point out that she had played Charlton Heston's mother twice in films, in ''The Ten Commandments'' (1957) and ''Ben-Hur'' (1959) and his wife twice onstage: in ''Design for a Stained Glass Window'' (1950) and ''The Tumbler'' (1960).         But her most sparkling accomplishment was when, as a 23-year-old novice, she was chosen at the last minute for the part of Emily Webb in ''Our Town,'' Wilder's classic about the cycles of birth, love and death in Grovers Corners, a small New England town.         A previous actress had been fired for not capturing the character in the final act, when Emily appears after death.         In an interview with The New York Times in 1969, Miss Scott recalled her brief audition with Jed Harris, the original producer and director of ''Our Town.'' He was desperate because the play was about to open in Princeton, N.J.; she had been recommended for the part by several of his colleagues.         ''He just pushed back my hair, looked at me and said, 'You've got the job,' '' she said. ''Then he said, 'How many years' experience have you had?' I told him five years. He said, 'You're gonna get a chance to prove it.' ''         She did. In his review in The Times in February 1938, Brooks Atkinson praised her interaction with John Craven, who played her husband, saying, ''Some of their scenes are lovely past all enduring.''         She was also praised for her performance as Emily in the film version, but lost the Academy Award to Ginger Rogers, who won for ''Kitty Foyle.''         In 1940, Miss Scott also appeared in ''The Howards of Virginia,'' which many critics consider Cary Grant's worst movie. Her other films included ''In Old Oklahoma'' (1943) with John Wayne and ''The Desperate Hours'' (1955) with Humphrey Bogart.         Martha Ellen Scott was born on Sept. 22, 1914, in Jamesport, Mo. Her father later opened a garage in Gallatin, Mo., and went on to become an engineer for a paint firm in Kansas City. Her parents disapproved of acting, but a sympathetic aunt reportedly lent her $2,500 so she could study acting at the University of Michigan. She repaid the loan.         She then appeared in Shakespearean parts at the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair. By the winter of 1937-38, she was making the rounds in Manhattan and was asked to audition for the role of Emily.         Miss Scott's long career kept veering back to the stage, which she loved best. In 1991, she played the doomed Rebecca Nurse in ''The Crucible,'' the first production of Tony Randall's National Actors Theater in New York.         Among her many television roles were Sue Ellen Ewing's mother on ''Dallas'' and a mysterious grandmother on ''General Hospital.''         She also produced plays. In 1968, she joined Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan in forming the Plumstead Playhouse, which produced classical revivals with all-star casts in New York. It later became the Plumstead Theater company in Los Angeles.         Her first marriage, to Carlton Alsop, a radio and film producer, ended in divorce in 1946. She later married the composer Mel Powell, who died in 1998.         She is survived by her son, Scott Alsop; her daughters Mary Powell Harpel and Kathleen Powell; and her brother, Charles Scott.         Miss Scott asked to be buried in the cemetery in Jamesport, where she rehearsed Emily's graveyard scene.       
         Sue Sally Hale, who broke American polo's sex barrier in 1972 when she gained membership in the sport's national governing body after playing matches disguised as a man for two decades, died last Tuesday at her ranch in Coachella, Calif. She was 65.         The cause was a ruptured aorta, her former husband, Alex Hale, said.         When Hale was growing up in Southern California, polo retained an image as a rich man's sport. But the United States Polo Association, the national governing agency, now lists some 600 women among its membership of 3,600. And the Hale family remains a major presence. Hale's daughter Sunny Hale is one of the leading women's players in the world, having competed with men at polo's premier event, the United States Open.         Hale was reared amid the glitter of Hollywood's polo set. Her father, Grover Jones, a well-known screenwriter, and her mother, Susan Avery, a former ballerina, wasted no time introducing her to the sport.         ''I had my first horse at 3,'' Hale told The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., earlier this year.         Her father died at about that time, and her mother later married Richard Talmadge, a motion-picture stuntman and actor. The glamorous matches at the Riviera Country Club were close at hand, but Hale did more than watch. She was ready to compete with men by the time she reached her early teens.         But women were not welcome except for minor club matches, so she applied mascara to her lip to simulate a mustache, wore oversized shirts and pulled her hair up under her helmet. She competed under the name A. Jones, her real identity known only to her teammates at first, although it eventually became clear in the polo world that A. Jones was really Hale.         ''After a game it was a kick to clean up for the parties and mingle unrecognized with the guys I'd just played on the field with,'' she told The Los Angeles Times years later.         Hale's repeated efforts to gain admission to the United States Polo Association were rebuffed. But her friends in the polo world applied pressure as well -- a lawsuit was threatened, as she recalled -- and in 1972 the association admitted her as its first woman.         Hale became a leading player, and in December 1990 she and her daughters Sunny and Stormie, along with France's leading polo-playing woman, Caroline Anier, won the first United States Women's Open.         Hale also coached polo teams at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and at the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Santa Ana, Calif., and provided polo lessons for handicapped people.         Capt. Caryll G. Rice II, the secretary of the Marine team she coached in the mid-1990's, recalled her enthusiasm. ''She had us posting without stirrups in the middle of August out in the desert,'' he wrote in Marines magazine. '' 'Come on, it'll be fun,' she said.''         Her marriage to Alex Hale, of Carmel, Calif., ended in divorce in 1976.         In addition to Sunny, of Norman, Okla., and Coral Gables, Fla., and Stormie, of Pacific Grove, Calif., she is survived by another daughter, Dawn, of Pacific Grove; a son, Trails, of Simi Valley, Calif.; a brother, Harold Jones, of Palm Desert, Calif.; and three grandchildren.         Hale worked to organize tournaments for women. Late in 1972, when her team played in Florida against a squad from the East Coast, the emotions were overwhelming.         ''We all just sat and cried,'' she told The Press-Enterprise, ''because we didn't think we'd ever get to play. Those were great games at that tournament. And that's where women's polo really started.''       
         Elizabeth Neuffer, the award-winning foreign correspondent for The Boston Globe who died on Friday in in an automobile accident in Iraq, had traveled there to cover the aftermath of the war. She was 46.         Ms. Neuffer was a passenger in a car that apparently struck a guardrail near Samarra, about halfway between Tikrit and Baghdad, The Globe said in a statement.         She was returning from an overnight trip to Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's ancestral home, where she had been reporting on efforts to dismantle the Baath Party apparatus that had helped enforce Mr. Hussein's government.         Her translator, Waleed Khalifa Hassan al-Dulami, was also killed.         Ms. Neuffer became European correspondent of The Globe, based in Berlin, in 1994, and spent much of her time reporting on fighting in the lands that once made up Yugoslavia. That assignment led to ''The Key to My Neighbor's House: Seeking Justice in Bosnia and Rwanda'' (Picador, 2002). The book, which was well received, grew out of a 10-part series in The Globe on war crimes in those countries.         Ms. Neuffer used two case studies, one of a Bosnian Muslim searching for information about his massacred family and the other about a Tutsi who testified about the rapes she endured in Rwanda, to study the meaning of atrocity.         In 1997, the series won the Novartis Prize for Excellence in International Journalism from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Paul D. Wolfowitz, then dean of the school and now deputy defense secretary, said the series demonstrated ''exceptional qualities of reportorial perseverance, courage and commitment and brought important, unresolved issues to the public's attention.''         In 1998, Ms. Neuffer won a Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. In its citation, the foundation referred to a bomb explosion in a marketplace in Sarajevo in 1994 that killed 68 people.         ''She helped pick up the bodies and then wrote her story,'' the citation said.         In 1998 and 1999, Ms. Neuffer was an Edward R. Murrow fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.         She was born on June 15, 1956, in Quincy, Mass., and grew up in Wilton, Conn. She graduated from Cornell and received a master's in political philosophy from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Then she became deputy press secretary to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.         Ms. Neuffer moved to London, where she wrote freelance articles for The New York Times and other publications. She then worked as a reporter trainee at The Times before joining The Globe, where her first beat was federal court in Boston.         Surviving are her brother, Mark, and her companion, Peter S. Canellos, Washington bureau chief of The Globe.       
         Katharine Hepburn, the actress whose independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of women and a beloved heroine to filmgoers for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 96 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Her physical presence was distinctive, her often-imitated voice filled with the vowels of a well-bred New Englander, and her sharp-planed face defined by remarkably high cheekbones. In her youth she did not have classical leading-lady looks, but a handsome beauty. In old age she was a familiar figure with her hair, gradually changing from auburn to gray, always in a topknot and her boyish figure always in the trousers that she helped to make fashionable.         She played sharp-witted, sophisticated women with an ease that suggested that there was a thin line between the movie role and the off-screen personality. The romantic comedy ''The Philadelphia Story'' and the screwball classic ''Bringing Up Baby'' were among her best, most typical roles. But through 43 films and dozens of stage and television appearances, she played comic and dramatic parts as varied as Jo in ''Little Women,'' the reborn spinster Rosie in ''The African Queen'' and Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter.''         Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day. Tracy was unhappily married and the father of two when they met, and he remained married until the end of his life. He and Miss Hepburn lived together for 27 years, until his death in 1967, and made nine films together.         ''Woman of the Year,'' ''Adam's Rib'' and ''Pat and Mike'' are typically bright and biting Tracy-Hepburn collaborations. She is wickedly smart, slightly aloof and emotionally vulnerable. He is commonsensical, down-to-earth and deeply decent. He manages to bring her down a peg; she never minds.         Hepburn and Tracy, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''so beautifully complemented each other'' that their relationship ''never seemed to be a matter of capitulation.'' Rather, he added, it was ''a matter of understanding and acknowledging each other's boundaries.''         The frisson of their off-screen romance, always hinted at but never acknowledged during his lifetime, followed them on screen and became especially poignant when they played a married couple in their last movie together, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' Tracy died just 17 days after they had finished filming it.         Through most of her career, Miss Hepburn had a reputation for being private and elusive with the press. In fact, she frequently granted interviews, although she was reticent about her personal life. But after the death of Tracy's wife, Louise, in 1983, Miss Hepburn felt free to discuss the love affair.         In later years she spoke openly about her life and career, especially in her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Although admittedly sketchy rather than a comprehensive memoir, the book captured the qualities that endeared Miss Hepburn to audiences: a conversational tone, a no-nonsense attitude and disarming candor. The autobiography became a best seller, a tribute to her enduring appeal across generational lines.         In 1993 she appeared in an autobiographical television documentary, ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me,'' made for the TNT cable network. She began: ''So this is about Katharine Hepburn, public, private. Can you tell which is which?'' She added, laughing, ''Sometimes I wonder myself.''         Longing to Be a Boy         Katharine Houghton Hepburn was born into a close family whose comfortable social status and unconventional opinions fostered self-confidence and independence. Her father, Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn, was a Hartford surgeon and a pioneer in fighting venereal disease. Her mother, Katharine Houghton, was a suffragist and a strong advocate of birth control.         In ''Me,'' Miss Hepburn finally revealed her age. ''I was born May 12, 1907,'' she wrote, ''despite everything I may have said to the contrary.'' For years she had said she was two years younger and had given her birthday as Nov. 8. That was the birthday of her older brother, Tom, who died at 16. Miss Hepburn, then 14, found his body hanging from the rafters of a house the family was visiting in New York City. The Hepburns said they never knew whether he had committed suicide and left open the possibility that he had been practicing a magic trick.         Although the family always called her Kathy or Kath, one summer Miss Hepburn so hated being a little girl that she cut her hair and called herself Jimmy. ''I thought being a girl was really the bunk,'' she said in an interview. ''But there's no bunk about Jimmy.''         After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1928, she had small parts in stock theater companies. She was dismissed from more than one play when she was starting out, but she retained supreme self-confidence. Late in life, she laughingly said of her younger self, ''I am terribly afraid I just assumed I'd be famous.''         She was first noticed professionally in her role as Antiope in the play ''The Warrior's Husband,'' a Greek fable in which she entered by descending a narrow staircase, carrying a stag over her shoulder.         That role led to a Hollywood screen test and her first film role, as John Barrymore's daughter in ''A Bill of Divorcement'' (1932). It was directed by George Cukor, who become one of her dearest friends (she and Tracy lived for years in the guest house on Cukor's Hollywood estate) and the director of many of her films, including ''Little Women.'' He once recalled of her screen test: ''She was unlike anybody I'd ever seen or heard. I was rather moved by the test, although the performance wasn't that good. But I thought, 'That girl is rather interesting.' ''         Fast Rise to Stardom         Miss Hepburn became a movie star quickly. She won an Academy Award for her role as Eva Lovelace, the naïve aspiring actress who learns a tough lesson about survival, in the 1933 film ''Morning Glory,'' only her third movie. Over the years she was nominated for a dozen Oscars, a record unbeaten until Meryl Streep received her 13th nomination this year. Miss Hepburn won three more, for ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''The Lion in Winter'' and ''On Golden Pond,'' but never showed up to collect any of them.         When she was 84, she looked back at those early days and, with her trademark tough-mindedness, said: ''In the beginning I had money; I wasn't a poor little thing. I don't know what I would have done if I'd had to come to New York and get a job as a waiter or something like that. I think I'm a success, but I had every advantage; I should have been.''         She also credited her husband with helping her get started in her career. For most of her life, the public thought she had never married. In fact, in 1928 she married Ludlow Ogden Smith, a member of a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She immediately made him change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow, partly because she didn't want to be known as Kate Smith.         They led separate lives long before their divorce in 1934, but they remained friendly. The town house they bought together in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan was Miss Hepburn's home until the end of her life (along with the family home on the Connecticut River, to which she returned often).         In later years she expressed regret at the way she had treated her husband. In an interview that echoed what she wrote in ''Me,'' she assumed a self-chastising, no-nonsense tone and said she had been ''an absolute pig with Luddy, absolute pig.'' She continued: ''He was an angel. I thought of myself first, and that's a pig, isn't it?''         ''I would have been terrified alone in New York City,'' she said. ''We bought this house in '31, and then the minute I won the Academy Award, I got rid of Luddy.'' Many years later, not long before he died, ''I tried to make up to him for the horror I had caused him,'' she added. ''He was so generous-spirited that I don't think he considered it horror. He just considered it a kid who was wildly ambitious or something.''         Miss Hepburn is survived by a brother, Dr. Robert H. Hepburn, and a sister, Margaret H. Perry, both of Canton, Conn.; four nieces; and nine nephews.         Trousers as a Trademark         Despite her early success, reviewers in those days sometimes found her strident and mannered. In 1933 she returned to Broadway in a spectacular failure, ''The Lake,'' which inspired Dorothy Parker to write her famous aphorism, ''She ran the gamut of emotion from A to B.''         Of those early years, she said: ''I strike people as peculiar in some way, although I don't quite understand why. Of course, I have an angular face, an angular body and, I suppose, an angular personality, which jabs into people.''         Over time her screen presence softened and became more likable; meanwhile, society was catching up to her willful, independent style. She had been wearing pants, then considered quite unladylike, since the 1930's.         In her 1993 television autobiography, she recalled: ''I realized long ago that skirts are hopeless. Anytime I hear a man say he prefers a woman in a skirt, I say: 'Try one. Try a skirt.' '' Although her choice was based on comfort, her trademark trousered look became so influential that the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave her a lifetime achievement award in 1986.         Many of her early films are now regarded as classics. Playing a tough, determined actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), she read a line from a play -- ''The calla lilies are in bloom again'' -- that became the all-time favorite of Hepburn impersonators. Life magazine said that ''Stage Door'' proved that she was ''potentially, the screen's greatest actress.''         She played a free-spirited heiress in ''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938), opposite Cary Grant and a leopard. But the film, now treasured, was a box-office flop, and by then her career was in decline. In 1938 she appeared on a list of actors labeled ''box-office poison'' in a poll of movie exhibitors.         Rather than appear in a film called ''Mother Carey's Chickens,'' she bought out her contract with R.K.O. She made ''Holiday,'' another classic romantic comedy with Grant, in which she was another high-spirited socialite.         Then Miss Hepburn took charge of her career in a way few women dared in those days of the studio system. Philip Barry wrote the play ''The Philadelphia Story'' for her, modeling his heroine, Tracy Lord, on Miss Hepburn. Tracy Lord is a beautiful, high-spirited rich woman, about to marry her second husband, when her first husband and a reporter who is covering the wedding arrive to create an unexpected romantic tangle.         The play was a hit, and Miss Hepburn owned the rights to it because Howard Hughes, a sometime beau, had bought them for her. She went to Louis B. Mayer, the head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, and sold him the property on the condition that she play the lead. She chose her friend George Cukor to direct. And she asked for Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable as her co-stars. She got Cary Grant as her former husband, James Stewart as the reporter, and a hit movie. She never lost control of her career again.         Soon she went back to Mayer with another script, ''Woman of the Year,'' the story of the unlikely romance between a hotshot political columnist and a sportswriter. She asked for Tracy, whom she had never met, to play the sportswriter. This time she got him.         A Loving Partnership         The success of ''Woman of the Year'' (1942) and the stars' off-screen relationship led to other Tracy and Hepburn films that followed a similar pattern. In ''Adam's Rib'' (1949), they are married, opposing lawyers, both nicknamed Pinky. In ''Pat and Mike'' (1952), she is a champion athlete, and he is her rough-hewn manager, with whom she falls in love.         The film was devised to show off Miss Hepburn's well-cultivated athletic ability. Almost to the end of her life she played tennis and swam, and in earlier years she golfed.         It was in ''Pat and Mike'' that Tracy spoke the often-quoted line about Miss Hepburn's figure, ''Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce.' ''         Miss Hepburn often said Tracy was the best actor she had ever known and compared him in complimentary terms to a baked potato: solid, substantial stuff. ''He's meat and potatoes, meat and potatoes,'' she would say. ''I'm more like a fancy French dessert, I'm a little bit fancy, aren't I? But I wish I were meat and potatoes.'' Her other films with Tracy included the political dramas ''Keeper of the Flame'' (1942) and ''State of the Union'' (1948).         One of her most enduring films without Tracy was ''The African Queen'' (1952), in which she played the straitlaced Rosie opposite Humphrey Bogart for the director John Huston.         She wrote about it in her first book, published in 1987, whose title captures the direct, colloquial style of her writing: ''The Making of the African Queen: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind'' (Knopf).         Later she achieved one of her great artistic triumphs in an unlikely role, as the 12th-century Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968). There was still something of the typical Hepburn persona in the steely manipulation and breaking heart of the aging, dismissed queen, but none of the actress's contemporary mannerisms.         Her versatility lasted well into her career. She played the distraught, drug-addicted Mary Tyrone in the 1962 film of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' She was a fair match in toughness for John Wayne in the western ''Rooster Cogburn'' (1975). And in ''On Golden Pond'' (1981) she starred opposite Henry Fonda as a feisty older woman coping with her husband's failing memory and insisting that they should go on and live life to the fullest. In that role, the on-screen and off-screen Hepburn seemed to meld as easily as they had in her youth.         Her final screen appearance, in 1994, was a minor but tremendously emotional role in ''Love Affair.'' Playing Warren Beatty's wise old aunt, she gave advice to the woman he loved, played by Annette Bening. Miss Hepburn's age gave the role the trappings of a farewell to movies, but if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been, even venturing an unprintable line about ducks.         Throughout her career, she returned to the stage periodically. She appeared in ''The Millionairess,'' by George Bernard Shaw, on Broadway in 1952. In the late 1950's she also appeared in several Shakespeare plays in Stratford, Conn.         And in 1969, when she was 62, she made her singing debut on Broadway in the Alan Jay Lerner musical ''Coco,'' based on the life of the fashion designer Coco Chanel. She also appeared on Broadway in 1976 in ''A Matter of Gravity,'' by Enid Bagnold, and in 1981 in ''The West Side Waltz,'' by Ernest Thompson, who had written ''On Golden Pond.''         Her performances in all three of these plays were received with dazzling praise; the works themselves were treated more harshly. Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote about her performance in ''The West Side Waltz'' in terms that reflected the general critical opinion: ''One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.''         A Beloved Aunt on TV         In the 1970's she acted in television movies, including the Edwardian romantic drama ''Love Among the Ruins'' (1975), with Laurence Olivier, and ''The Corn Is Green'' (1979), both directed by Cukor. And in later years she kept busy with minor television movies.         She played a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character in ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'' (1986), ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' (1988) and ''The Man Upstairs'' (1992).         In 1994 she appeared in a few scenes in the television movie ''One Christmas,'' as yet another wise old aunt. Her tailor-made Hepburn lines included these: ''I've always lived my life exactly as I wanted. I wouldn't change a single thing. No regrets.''         As she aged, she had some physical problems from which she recovered well. She had hip-replacement surgery and operations on both her shoulders, but she remained spry. Although her head shook visibly in television interviews from the 1980's on, she vehemently denied the rumor that she had Parkinson's disease, saying she had inherited her shaking head from her grandfather Hepburn.         Her most striking television appearance was not in a dramatic role, but in a 1986 tribute to Spencer Tracy. Speaking openly about their relationship at last, she read a letter she had written to him, which she later included in her autobiography. She recalled their last years together, when he was ill and had trouble sleeping, and she would sit on the floor by his side and talk. She wondered why he drank.         ''What was it, Spense?'' she asked. It was an eloquent and sentimental performance that distilled the way her public and private lives blended.         At the conclusion of ''All About Me,'' her own television biography, she said: ''In some ways I've lived my life as a man, made my own decisions. I've been as terrified as the next person, but you've got to keep a-going; you've got to dream.'' In typical Katharine Hepburn style, she faced the camera and, at the age of 85, tacitly acknowledged how close she had to be to the end.         ''I have no fear of death,'' she said. ''Must be wonderful, like a long sleep. But let's face it: it's how you live that really counts.''         With her angular beauty and unmistakable voice, Katharine Hepburn was a distinctive presence in films and on stage, whether sparring with a modern-day suitor or trading quips in Shakespearean dress. Here are some of the plays and films in which she appeared.         Plays         The Warrior's Husband -- 1932  The Lake -- 1933  Jane Eyre -- 1937  The Philadelphia Story -- 1939  Without Love -- 1942  As You Like It -- 1950  The Millionairess -- 1952  The Merchant of Venice -- 1957  Much Ado About Nothing -- 1957  Twelfth Night -- 1960  Antony and Cleopatra -- 1960  Coco -- 1969  A Matter of Gravity -- 1976  The West Side Waltz -- 1981         Films         A Bill of Divorcement -- 1932  Christopher Strong -- 1933  Morning Glory -- 1933  Little Women -- 1933  The Little Minister -- 1934  Alice Adams -- 1935  Sylvia Scarlett -- 1936  Quality Street -- 1937  Stage Door -- 1937  Bringing Up Baby -- 1938  Holiday -- 1938  The Philadelphia Story -- 1940  Woman of the Year -- 1942  Dragon Seed -- 1944  The Sea of Grass -- 1947  State of the Union -- 1948  Adam's Rib -- 1949  The African Queen -- 1951  Pat and Mike -- 1952  Summertime -- 1955  The Rainmaker -- 1956  Desk Set -- 1957  Long Day's Journey Into Night -- 1962  Guess Who's Coming to Dinner -- 1967  The Lion in Winter -- 1968  Rooster Cogburn -- 1975  Love Among the Ruins (television) -- 1975  The Corn Is Green (television) -- 1979  On Golden Pond -- 1981  Love Affair -- 1994       
         Doris Bass Andrews, who with her husband, Sperry Andrews, pursued the preservation of Weir Farm, where the Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir and friends met for painting and social activity, died on May 25 in Danbury, Conn. She was 82.         The farm, in Ridgefield and Wilton, Conn., is now the Weir Farm National Historic Site, with programs for both artists and the public. The programs are run by the Weir Farm Trust, a private nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the National Park Service.         Doris Bass was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from the Erskine School in Boston. She was an Army telegraph operator during World War II and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1947, she married Mr. Andrews, a fellow student, and they became working artists who painted in watercolors.         In the late 1950's they bought the buildings that Weir owned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1982, amid plans to build housing on former Weir farmland owned by others, the Andrewses were among those campaigning to preserve the site. Sixty acres of the original farm won historic status in 1990.         The trust's programs for professional artists include a competitive artist-in-residence program and a regional visiting artist program.         Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Catherine Barrett Andrews of Madison, Ga.; two sons, Charles Sperry Andrews IV of Sedona, Ariz., and Albert Ballard Andrews of Wilton; and a brother, Bruce Bass of Louisville.       
         Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker who specialized in portraits of New York City Ballet dancers, died last Wednesday at her daughter's home in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan and Remsenberg, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Catherine Tambini, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Belle's two earliest films, ''Baymen -- Our Waters Are Dying,'' about the clam diggers of eastern Long Island, and ''Henry,'' about an independent old man living on a barge on the Hudson River, were shown on PBS. She later produced a trilogy of dance films about Suzanne Farrell, Alexandra Danilova and six ballerinas who worked with George Balanchine. The 1996 film ''Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse,'' an Academy Award nominee that she directed with Deborah Dickson, was a revealing portrait of a reticent young ballerina, Balanchine's last great inspiration, whom the choreographer loved deeply but failed to win off stage.         Ms. Belle captured all of the gaiety and pragmatism of Danilova, prima ballerina of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1938 to 1952, in her 1987 documentary ''Reflections of a Dancer: Alexandra Danilova.''         ''Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balanchine Ballerinas,'' a 1989 documentary that Ms. Belle directed with Ms. Dickson, had affectionate portrayals of the choreographer and the ballerinas Maria Tallchief, Mary Ellen Moylan, Melissa Hayden, Allegra Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler.         At her death, Ms. Belle was working on a documentary on Stanley Williams, a teacher at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, and had an option to film the book ''Passionate Nomad'' by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, a biography of the explorer Freya Stark.         Born in Chile, she grew up in Canada, Morocco and England and studied ballet in London before moving to New York City. She worked for a time in New York as a freelance writer and an editor at House & Garden magazine. She received a master of fine arts degree from the New York University Graduate Institute of Film and Television in 1968.         Ms. Belle also produced, directed and edited several short films for the Children's Television Workshop. Her films have been shown at the Sundance and New York Dance Films Festival and at festivals in Berlin, Montreal, Chicago, Leningrad, Melbourne and Sydney.         In addition to her daughter, Antonia, of Los Angeles, Ms. Belle is survived by her husband, John Belle, partner in the architectural firm of Beyer, Blinder, Belle; her brother Michael Stagg of Oakland, Calif.; her son, David, of New York City; her stepchildren, Sebastian, of Augusta, Me., Fenella of Charlottesville, Va., and Amelia, of Sonoma, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Carol Shields, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Canadian novelist who captured and illuminated the ordinariness of life -- ''domesticity, the shaggy beast that eats up 50 percent of our lives,'' as she put it -- died on Wednesday in Victoria, British Columbia. She was 68.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, which was diagnosed late in 1998.         In her 10 novels, 3 collections of stories and 3 volumes of poetry, Ms. Shields's subject was almost invariably the profundity of the mundane, the kind of subject matter that, she said, usually gets ''shoved aside by fiction writers.''         In her hands the commonplace turned into extraordinary, a skill that became evident to an audience beyond Canada with her seventh novel, ''The Stone Diaries,'' published by Random House Canada in 1993 and by Viking in the United States a year later. Narrated with humor and irony, ''The Stone Diaries'' traced the nearly nine-decade 20th-century life of Daisy Goodwill Flett, an ordinary woman but a pilgrim in search of herself. As well as a Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1995, the novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Governor General's Award for fiction, and was shortlisted for a Booker Prize. (Dual citizenship in Canada and the United States made her eligible for numerous prizes.)         Earlier Ms. Shields had built a following with her novels and stories about ordinary people in everyday situations. ''Because she's a comic writer and genuinely funny, early on she was put in the 'sweet' box, where she does not belong,'' the novelist Margaret Atwood, a friend, told an interviewer. ''The fact is, there's a dark thread in everything she writes.''         Ms. Shields once explained her writing this way: ''My novels have centered on half a dozen concerns -- the lives of women, notions of gender, the force of time, the genesis of art, synchronicity, the relationship of fiction and biography.''         Carol Ann Warner was born on June 2, 1935, in Oak Park, Ill., the third child (after fraternal twins) of Robert Elmer, a candy factory manager, and Inez (Selgren) Warner, a schoolteacher. She attended Hanover College in Indiana, and after earning a bachelor's degree in 1957 she married Donald Hugh Shields, a Canadian civil engineer. They met while she was on a study-abroad program in Britain. The couple settled in Winnipeg and had five children -- John, Anne, Catherine, Meg and Sara. Her husband, children and 11 grandchildren survive her, as well as her brother, Robert Warner, and her sister, Barbara Hipple.         Despite the demands of domesticity, Ms. Shields kept writing poems and stories in what little personal time she had. She once described herself as ''the mother who typed.'' She earned a master's degree in literature at the University of Ottawa in 1975, writing a thesis on the Canadian writer Susanna Moodie. Material that she could not work into her thesis became part of her first novel, ''Small Ceremonies'' (1976), about a woman writing a biography of Moodie. She would play such literary games throughout her career, often borrowing from other writers -- like Margaret Laurence and John Updike -- and making her derivativeness a playful theme of her fiction.         ''Small Ceremonies'' was accepted for publication just as Ms. Shields turned 40, and it began her career. At first she followed conventional naturalistic forms, in ''The Box Garden'' (1977), about the unmarried sister of the protagonist in ''Small Ceremonies''; in ''Happenstance'' (1980), a pair of complementary novellas, one narrated by a wife, the other by her husband; and in ''A Fairly Conventional Woman'' (1982), about a woman who chooses her marriage over an extramarital affair.         But she grew impatient with the classic plot of the hero or heroine facing a crisis that worsens before it can be resolved. ''I wanted wallpaper in my novels, cereal bowls, cupboards, cousins, buses, local elections, head colds, cramps, newspapers,'' she wrote in 1998, ''and I abandoned Chekhov's dictum that if there is a rifle hanging over the fireplace, it must go off before the story ends.'' She continued: ''A rifle could hang over a fireplace for countless other reasons. For atmosphere, to give texture, to comment on the owner of the house, to ignite a scene with its presence, not its ammunition.''         She began to experiment in ''Various Miracles'' (1985), a short-story collection, and continued in ''Swann'' (1987), in which the relationship of art to its audience is amusingly explored in four narrative voices and a concluding film script. ''The Republic of Love'' (1992) played with the romance-novel form -- tracing a courtship with chapters that alternate between male and female viewpoints -- and won Ms. Shields a wider international audience. Then came ''The Stone Diaries,'' followed by ''Larry's Party'' (1997), which set out to explore, as the author put it, ''what it's like to be an ordinary, middle-aged guy at the end of the century.''         The year her first novel was published she began to teach literature, first at the University of Ottawa, then, in 1978 and '79 at the University of British Columbia, and, from 1980 to 2000, at the University of Manitoba. In 1996 she became chancellor of the University of Winnipeg, and in 2000 she became its chancellor emerita.         Her cancer was diagnosed just before Christmas in 1998. After beginning chemotherapy and recovering from the shock of learning she was sick (she spent a month ''just crying on the sofa,'' she told an interviewer for The New York Times Magazine), she finished compiling another collection of short fiction, ''Dressing Up for the Carnival'' (2000), completed a brief biography of Jane Austen for the Penguin Lives Series, and set to work on a 10th novel.         In an unexpected burst of energy, she completed ''Unless,'' a feminist story about a writer whose oldest daughter, Norah, drops out of college and takes up silent begging on a sidewalk with a cardboard sign reading ''Goodness'' hanging from her neck. The novel was published in May 2002 to favorable reviews. Ms. Shields was working on another novel at the time of her death, and research for it brought her back to Chicago, her hometown.         ''I believe in goodness,'' she has said. ''I'm amazed by the amount of goodness in the world.''         She appended this view later: ''I think that evil is the occasional breakdown of goodness, a very occasional rupture,'' she told an interviewer for Maclean's magazine. ''To me, it seems astonishing that people are as good as they are. That's the surprising thing.''         She added, ''I do feel this sense of goodness is part of our human condition -- the biggest part of it.''       
         Jean R. Warnke, a volunteer in social service organizations in Washington and the widow of Paul C. Warnke, a top official in the Johnson and Carter administrations, died on Monday in a Brooklyn hospice. She was 80 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Warnke, born Jean Farjeon Rowe in Ossining, N.Y., was a member of the board of Family and Child Services Inc. of Washington, serving as its president from 1984 to 1986. She also volunteered for the women's committee of the Smithsonian Institution and was a volunteer mediator in small claims court in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree from American University in 1973.         Mrs. Warnke's husband died in 2001. Her survivors include two daughters, Margaret, of Vineyard Haven, Mass., and Georgia, of South Pasadena, Calif.; three sons, Thomas, of Long Beach, Calif., and Stephen and Benjamin, both of Brooklyn; a brother, George Rowe Jr. of Irvington, N.Y.; and 11 grandchildren.       
         Lady Diana Mosley, one of the famous Mitford sisters and a glamorous 1930's socialite who scandalously abandoned her husband, embraced fascism and married Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, died in Paris on Monday, her family said. She was 93.         A spokeswoman for her sister, the Duchess of Devonshire, told the BBC, ''We can confirm that she died peacefully, but we cannot say any more than that.''         Lady Mosley's stubborn fascism and her unrepentant admiration for Hitler -- he and Josef Goebbels were guests at her wedding to Sir Oswald, in Berlin in 1936 -- made her a figure of hate to the British during World War II, and to some extent for the rest of her life. Judged a danger to her country, she spent two and a half years in Holloway Prison in London while war raged on the Continent.         After the war, she and Sir Oswald, who also served time in Holloway, moved to Orsay, Paris, where they lived happily, and only partly in disgrace, for the rest of their lives (he died in 1980). Although shunned by the British establishment -- British ambassadors to France were instructed not to invite her to the embassy, for instance -- Lady Mosley presided over a beautifully decorated house, Temple de la Gloire, where she gardened, wrote, read, gave interviews, kept up on London literary gossip and entertained an endless stream of glittery visitors who were, inevitably, thoroughly enchanted by her quick wit, sparkling appearance, and sly sense of humor.         She was one of the few people ever to maintain simultaneous friendships with Hitler and Churchill.         ''There were so many paradoxes about this most beautiful, most intelligent, and most beguiling of the celebrated Mitford sisters,'' the novelist and critic A. N. Wilson, a friend of Lady Mosley, wrote in The Daily Telegraph. Also in The Daily Telegraph, the historian Andrew Roberts described succumbing, however unwillingly, ''to the full force of her Mitfordesque charm,'' even as Lady Mosley calmly announced that although Hitler ''was to blame for the extermination of the Jews,'' he was also perhaps the most attractive man she had ever met.         Lady Diana Mosley was born the Honorable Diana Mitford in 1910, the third of the six Mitford girls (a brother, Tom, was killed in World War II). They were fabled for their wit and luminous looks -- each one seemed to glitter more brightly than the next -- and their eccentric upbringing was immortalized in various books, including the novels ''The Pursuit of Love,'' ''Love in a Cold Climate,'' and others by Nancy Mitford; and ''Hons and Rebels,'' a memoir by Jessica Mitford. Their father was Lord Redesdale, a blustery country aristocrat with little money and old-fashioned views, fond of outdoor pursuits and famously bad-tempered about the outside society for which his daughters longed.         They found it, in wildly different ways. Nancy, an intimate of Evelyn Waugh, became a hugely successful novelist and essayist and ardent anti-fascist. Jessica became a Communist, running away from home to join Esmond Romilly, a wastrel nephew of Churchill, who had gone to Spain to work as a journalist in the Spanish Civil War (she later settled in the United States and wrote ''The American Way of Death,'' a brilliantly acerbic analysis of the American funeral industry, among other things).         Unity, another sister, became a fanatical fascist, befriended Hitler and was so distraught when Britain entered World War II that she shot herself in the head, botching the suicide attempt but suffering extensive brain damage. Deborah, another sister, married the Duke of Devonshire, one of the best catches in all of British bachelorhood.         In a family of dazzling girls, Diana dazzled perhaps the brightest. ''She was the nearest thing to Botticelli's Venus that I have ever seen,'' wrote James Lees-Milne, a family friend; Evelyn Waugh, who dedicated ''Vile Bodies'' to her, said that her beauty ''ran through the room like a peal of bells.'' At 18, she became engaged after a few weeks' acquaintance to the brewing heir Bryan Guinness, a match that seemed objectionable only to her mother -- he was ''so frightfully rich,'' Lady Redesdale said.         The two quickly had two sons. With her beauty and wit, and his money, the Guinnesses became the center of young London society, but Diana wanted more. In 1932, she left her husband for Oswald Mosley, the strikingly attractive leader of the fledgling British Union of Fascists, a bold step, not least because he was still married (his wife conveniently died, of peritonitis, the following year).         Diana threw herself into her lover's cause, hoping to effect amity between fascist Germany and Britain. After the two were married, in 1936, Diana Mosley had two more sons, and devoted herself to raising them. She was arrested and jailed in 1940, when the second was just a baby. Though the prison years were miserable, she tried to make light of them after the fact, as she did about her exile in Paris.         ''The story about us being pariahs and all that, it's all nonsense really,'' she told an interviewer last year. ''I've never had rudeness or disagreeableness ever. At meetings there were rows with Communists and so on. If you met the Communists at dinner, you wouldn't have a row.''         Sir Oswald Mosley, a hereditary baronet, died in 1980, and Lady Mosley never remarried. She reconciled with her sister Nancy, nursing her through the cancer that led to Nancy's death in 1973, and made peace with some, but by no means all, of her other relatives. Through it all, she was always impeccably dressed, always a gracious hostess, and always intellectually vigorous, contributing book reviews to The Times of London, the Evening Standard, and the Spectator, among other publications, and answering frankly and unflinchingly when interviewers and historians made pilgrimages to Paris to ask her about the old days.         She is survived by a far-flung extended family, including the Duchess of Devonshire, her last surviving sister; four sons, two by each of her husbands; and a large number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.         She remained passionate about Sir Oswald, the love of her life, to the end. ''He appeared to me then as he does still, the cleverest, most balanced, and most honest of all English politicians,'' she said in her memoir, ''A Life of Contrasts.'' Nor did she ever fully denounce Hitler -- she was too stubbornly loyal to her beliefs and her behavior for that, her friends believe -- although she deplored his excesses.         ''We all know that he was a monster, that he was cruel and did terrible things,'' she said. ''But that doesn't alter the fact that he was obviously an interesting figure.''         She added, in an interview in 2000: ''I was very fond of him. Very, very fond.''         Correction:  September 9, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 14 about Diana Mosley, the British aristocrat who was a staunch supporter of Hitler and fascism, referred incompletely to Esmond Romilly, who had married one of her sisters, Jessica Mitford. Although Mr. Romilly was a rebellious young man of privilege, he also became a published writer and an ardent anti-fascist who fought against Franco in Spain and, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, died in 1941, at 23, in a bombing raid against Nazi Germany.       
         Dr. Josefina B. Magno, an oncologist who established some of the first hospice programs in the United States and helped bring the hospice concept into the medical mainstream, died on July 27 in Manila. She was 83.         Born in the Philippines, Dr. Magno moved to the Washington area in 1969 to join the staff of the Georgetown University Hospital. Three years later, breast cancer was detected, and she underwent a radical mastectomy and intensive chemotherapy.         The experience made her more aware of the physical and emotional pain suffered by the terminal patients around her. It also made her realize that the medical profession, which focused on curing illness and prolonging life, had relatively little to offer the dying.         After recovering, Dr. Magno went to England, where the world's first research and teaching hospice was established in 1967. She studied the hospice approach there, which combined pain management with psychological and spiritual counseling.         In 1976, she created a pilot hospice program at Georgetown, persuading Blue Cross-Blue Shield to cover expenses for its subscribers by pointing out that fees would be half what hospitals charged. The next year, she established the Hospice of Northern Virginia.         Dr. Magno became the first executive director of the National Hospice Organization in 1980. In three years in office, she persuaded Congress to pass legislation to include hospice care under Medicare.         In 1984, she established the International Hospice Institute to train doctors in the United States and developing countries. Moving to Michigan, she founded the first hospice there and created the hospice service at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. In 1998, she returned to the Philippines, where she helped establish programs for the poor.         Josefina Bautista Magno was born on Dec. 28, 1919, in San Fernando, Pampanga, on Luzon. She received a medical degree from the University of Santo Tomas.         She is survived by six children: Jose, Manny and Cesar, of Detroit; Vincent, of Richmond; and Nanette Magno-Velayo and Carlo, of Manila; three sisters; a brother; 15 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. Cesar P. Magno, died in 1955.       
         Nadia Younes, an Egyptian who was chief of staff for the senior United Nations representative in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, died in the bomb attack in Baghdad on Monday, the United Nations said on Wednesday. She was 57.         Mr. Vieira de Mello also died in the attack.         Earlier, Ms. Younes served as chief of protocol at the biggest gathering of world leaders the United Nations has every held, the meeting of 150 kings, presidents, prime ministers and dictators at its headquarters in New York in September 2000.         Ms. Younes was made chief protocol officer by Secretary General Kofi Annan in January 1998 and held the post until 2002. She had a major role in organizing the millennium summit meeting, as well as the responsibility for keeping feathers unruffled during the three-day gathering.         That the meeting, mainly devoted to brainstorming about the coming century, went off smoothly was in large measure attributed to Ms. Younes's dextrous handling of the assembled potentates.         Ms. Younes faced some tricky moments. The wife of a Saudi delegate, thrilled by a ride on a double-decker New York sightseeing bus, asked her how to buy one and take it home. And a mysterious figure identified as Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta somehow got himself into the official photo of world leaders.         From 1999 until 2001, Ms. Younes took time off from her protocol duties to serve as spokeswoman for Bernard Kouchner, the French politician and founder of Doctors Without Borders, while he was United Nations administrator in Kosovo.         From 1988 until 1993, she was deputy to the spokesman for the secretary general, serving Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and Boutros Boutros-Ghali.         Nadia Younes was born in Cairo on June 13, 1946, and earned a bachelor's degree in English literature at Cairo University in 1966.         She joined the United Nations in 1970, at the same time beginning studies at New York University, where she earned a master's degree in political science and international relations in 1973. She transferred to the department of public information in 1974 and held a large number of press and information positions. In 1993 she went to Rome to head the United Nations information office there.         In 2002 she transferred to the World Health Organization in Geneva, where she took charge of external relations for Gro Harlem Brundtland, then the director general. Earlier this year she moved to Baghdad.         She is survived by a brother, Fouad Younes, of Cairo, and a sister, Nahed Fouad, of London.       
         Judith Arango Henderson, a design expert, curator and columnist whose Miami retail store, Arango Inc., was one of the first to specialize in midcentury modern design, died on July 12 in Piedmont, Calif. She was 75 and lived there and in Miami.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         The store, opened in 1959 and still in operation, brought an appreciation for simple, functional design to a city famous for fanciful ornamentation. It sells flatware, glassware, furniture and other household items, many by modernists like Alvar Aalto and Arne Jacobsen, all designed for aesthetic appeal as well as utility. The store also presented exhibitions devoted to designers, materials, manufacturers and design trends.         Ms. Arango was acknowledged to have influenced generations of designers and architects in Miami. In 1981, she expanded her exhibition program by establishing the Arango Design Foundation.         Its shows, which traveled to other cities, included ''Out of the Ordinary,'' a look at well-designed and commonly available objects like paintbrushes, padlocks and a scissors to remove the tops of soft-boiled eggs, and ''Re(f)use,'' devoted to products made from recycled materials.         Ms. Arango was also a contributor to design publications like Abitare and Domus, and she wrote a ''Design of the Month'' column for The San Francisco Chronicle. The column, which reviewed everyday items like mops and coffee makers, appeared through this summer.         Ms. Arango, whose maiden name was Wolpert, was born on July 1, 1928, in Miami, where her father owned a conventional furniture store. After graduating from Wellesley with a degree in philosophy, she worked for the United States Information Service in Bogotá, Colombia.         Ms. Arango's first marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, John B. Henderson of Piedmont and Miami; her children from her first marriage, Richard Arango of Miami and Virginia Arango of Raleigh, N.C.; a sister, Carol Jane Gottfried of Miami; a brother, Jordan Dancer of Scottsdale, Ariz.; and two grandchildren.       
         Marilyn E. Marlow, a literary agent who represented and championed many outstanding children's book writers and illustrators, especially those who wrote for teenage readers, died on Aug. 25 at the home of her niece Meg McCabe in Katonah, N.Y. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was cancer, her family said.         In 1959 Ms. Marlow joined the Curtis Brown literary agency, and she remained there, becoming executive vice president.         She maintained lifetime relationships with many of her clients, for example taking on S. E. Hinton when she was a teenager in Tulsa, Okla. Ms. Hinton's first novel, ''The Outsiders,'' published in 1967, is widely considered one of the first books in the young adult genre; it was later made into a movie by Francis Ford Coppola. Ms. Marlow also represented Robert Cormier, the author of ''The Chocolate War''(1974) and other books for teenagers that were considered controversial because of their dark subject matter.         Her clients included entire families, like the Hurds: Clement, the illustrator of ''Goodnight Moon'' and ''The Runaway Bunny''; Edith, the author of ''Johnny Lion's Rubber Boots,''; and their son, Thacher, the author and illustrator of ''Art Dog.'' Among her other noted authors and illustrators were Jane Yolen, Jane Dyer, Karen Cushman and Patricia McKissack. Among the writers for adults whom she also represented from the beginning of her career were Wilfred Sheed, John Leonard and Michael Novak.         Ms. Marlow was born and raised in Waterloo, Iowa, graduated from the University of Northern Iowa at Cedar Falls and received a master's degree in English from the University of Michigan in 1953. She taught high school English in Iowa and Michigan before coming to New York in 1957. She worked for the publisher Harcourt Brace World before joining Curtis Brown.         Her survivors include a brother, William Marlow, of Arlington, Va., and a sister, Joan Marlow Foley, of Schoolcraft, Mo.       
         Gisele MacKenzie, the Canadian singing star of the 1950's television show ''Your Hit Parade,'' died on Friday in Burbank, Calif. She was 76.         The cause was colon cancer, said her daughter, Gigi Downs.         Although she was known mainly for her contralto voice, Ms. MacKenzie also traded barbs and violin riffs with Jack Benny and played the piano on her own variety show. On ''Your Hit Parade,'' she sang the most popular tunes of the week with her fellow cast members Snooky Lanson, Dorothy Collins and Russell Arms.         Gisele Marie Louise Marguerite La Fleche was born on Jan. 10, 1927, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her father, a doctor who played the violin, and her mother, who sang and played the organ, encouraged her musical talent. She studied violin in her teens at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, but she began singing and playing popular songs on the piano after school. At a party where she sang for wartime sailors, she met Robert Shuttleworth, a military bandleader, who later hired her to perform with his hotel orchestra.         He became her business manager, and in 1958, her husband.         Ms. MacKenzie wavered between a career as a singer or one as a concert violinist until her $3,000 violin was stolen from a parked car. Her vocation thus resolved, she began singing on a Canadian radio show called ''Meet Gisele'' in 1946, her popularity earning her the informal title of Canada's first lady of song.         In 1951, when she began to sing in the United States, she took her father's middle name, MacKenzie, as her last name. In an interview with The New York Journal in 1956, she said she worried that the name Gisele La Fleche ''sounded like a strip tease artist's.''         She sang for two years on Bob Crosby's radio show ''Club 15,'' and when it went off the air, she joined Jack Benny on tour. The attention she gained with Mr. Benny won her a spot on ''Your Hit Parade,'' replacing June Valli.         She appeared on the show from 1953 to 1957, then left to star in her own variety series, ''The Gisele MacKenzie Show,'' which lasted only six months. In 1963 she was on weekly television again, becoming a regular on ''The Sid Caesar Show.'' Over the next four decades, she starred in regional theater and made guest appearances on television game shows and series like ''MacGyver'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.''         Her two marriages, to Mr. Shuttleworth and to Robert Klein, a businessman, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Downs, of Newport Beach, Calif., she is survived by a son, Mac Shuttleworth; a brother, George La Fleche; a sister, Janine Helzer; and two grandchildren.       
         Marie Foster, a dental technician whose quiet but effective efforts to win voting rights for blacks made her a national symbol when she was beaten by the police in the Selma, Ala., voting rights march in 1965, died on Saturday in Selma. She was 85.         She was one of the original eight members of the Dallas County Voters League, a group that came to be called the Courageous Eight and worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to make Selma the center of a national crusade. She was later called ''the mother of the voting rights movement'' by its local organizers.         She tried eight times to register to vote before succeeding; she had already started coaching blacks on how to pass the deliberately bewildering voter registration tests.         She was clubbed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge when state troopers stopped the first march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7. Two days later, she tried to hobble forward in another march, one that was stopped peacefully.         On March 11, when President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to announce that he would send Congress a strong voting rights bill, it was in Mrs. Foster's living room that Dr. King watched and wept at the news.         When the march was finally permitted to begin on March 21, two weeks later, Mrs. Foster walked 50 miles in five days with injured knees.         In his book on the civil rights movement, ''The Children'' (Random House, 1998), David Halberstam called Mrs. Foster ''one of the heroes of the Selma group.''         Marie Priscilla Martin was born on Oct. 24, 1917, in rural Wilcox County, near Alberta, Ala. Her mother wanted her children to be educated, but her father resisted moving to town, Mrs. Foster said in a statement prepared for the Web site of the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, which she helped found. Her mother then sneaked away and took her children to Selma.         Mrs. Foster dropped out of high school to marry and had three young children when her husband died. After working for years, she returned to high school and graduated after her daughter, Rose. She then went to junior college, became a dental hygienist and went to work for her brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson.         She became involved in the growing voting rights movement because of anger over racial discrimination. Mr. Halberstam suggested that being employed by her brother protected her from economic pressure from the white establishment.         Working with the Dallas County Voters League, she went door to door with leaflets and asked all ministers in town to announce the registration effort from their pulpits.         Things at first went slowly. Taylor Branch, in his book ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998), said her first nighttime class to teach literacy for the voting test drew one student, a man in his 70's.         In 1964, she was named in an injunction against voter registration leaders along with John Lewis, the civil rights leader who is now a Georgia congressman, Mr. Branch wrote. The Ku Klux Klan threatened her life several times.         In 1985, Mrs. Foster told about her experience at the bridge in an interview with United Press International.         ''It was a trooper who hit me,'' she said, adding that it happened just as she crossed the bridge near the head of the column of about 525 demonstrators. ''I lay on the pavement with my eyes closed. I didn't move. I stood my ground.''         Mrs. Foster is survived by her son, James Foster of Indianapolis; her daughter, Rose Davis of Salt Lake City; her brothers, Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Thomas Martin, both of Selma; and three grandchildren.         Her activism never stopped, said Rose Sanders, a friend and civil rights lawyer. Among more recent battles, Mrs. Foster was a leader in successful fights for public housing for poor people in Selma and the removal of a statue of the founder of the Klan from a public park.         She conducted reading classes for underprivileged children in a small classroom next to her home, and made it a point to take poor children to Sunday school.         ''She never quit,'' Ms. Sanders said.       
         Margaret E. Murie, a conservationist and an author who helped preserve millions of acres of unspoiled land in Alaska and across the United States by encouraging the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the passage of the Wilderness Act, died on Sunday at her ranch in Moose, Wyo. She was 101.         A longtime official of the Wilderness Society, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Bill Clinton in 1998.         Ms. Murie, who was known as Mardy, grew up in a log cabin in Alaska, an experience that she wrote about in her autobiography, ''Two in the Far North.''         Published in 1962 and still in print, the book describes the winter night when she was 14 and Fairbanks caught fire, prompting her father and other men to burn the town's bacon supply as fuel to keep the steam-powered water pump running; her late-winter dogsled trips over thawing rivers; how in 1924 she became the first woman to graduate from the University of Alaska; and her marriage later that year, in a 3 a.m. sunrise ceremony, to Olaus Murie, a biologist for the Biological Survey, the forerunner of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.         ''Two in the Far North'' also recounts the couple's honeymoon, a 500-mile caribou research expedition by dogsled, as well as a later river journey taken with their infant son, Martin, strapped to their canoe.         Although Ms. Murie (pronounced MYUR-ee) and her husband moved to Wyoming in the 1930's to study elk migrations, they never lost their focus on Alaska and returned there often.         After traveling in the Brooks Range above the Arctic Circle in the summer of 1956, they began a campaign to set aside parts of the area as a wildlife refuge.         Four years later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower designated eight million acres as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; President Jimmy Carter more than doubled the protected area in 1980.         The Muries extended their preservation campaign in the early 1960's by lobbying Congress in behalf of the Wilderness Act, legislation intended to prevent development on designated lands nationwide. Ms. Murie continued her support after her husband's death in 1963. She was invited to the White House by President Lyndon B. Johnson to attend the signing of the act.         Ms. Murie received numerous other honors for her support of conservation and the protection of the environment, including the 1980 Audubon Medal and the 1983 John Muir Award from the Sierra Club.         Born Margaret Elizabeth Thomas on Aug. 18, 1902, in Seattle, she moved to Alaska with her family when she was 9.         In addition to her autobiography, she wrote two other books, ''Island Between,'' published in 1977, and ''Wapiti Wilderness,'' published in 1966 with her husband as co-author.         Their Wyoming home, the Murie Ranch, was declared a National Historic District in 1997 and today is the headquarters of the Murie Center, an educational center dedicated to conservation.         Ms. Murie is survived by her sister Louise Murie-MacLeod of Jackson, Wyo., who was the wife of Olaus's brother Adolph, who was a National Park Service biologist and an author; two sons, Martin, of North Bangor, N.Y., and Donald, of Palm Springs, Calif.; a daughter, Joanne Miller of Brookline, Mass.; 9 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Judy Hendren Mello, former president and chief executive of the First Women's Bank in Manhattan, died Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 60 and had homes in Manhattan; Millbrook, N.Y.; and Moose, Wyo.         The cause was complications of ovarian cancer, said her husband, Jay Marc Schwamm.         She ran the bank, which was on 57th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, from 1980 to 1983, then resigned.         The bank, a creation of the feminist movement, was established in April 1975. It was the first bank in the United States to be operated by women and for women, at a time when its founders said that women were given short shrift by other banks.         While she led the bank, it earned small profits, but its heyday passed as other banks moved to address concerns of women. Some time after she stepped down, a group of New York City businessmen acquired a controlling interest in the bank. Its name was changed and it subsequently failed.         Born on July 14, 1943, in Chickasha, Okla., she received a bachelor's degree from Muskingum College in Ohio and attended Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.         She worked for Marine Midland Bank, Lehman Brothers, American Express and Cambridge International Partners.         From 1991 to 1998 she was president and owner of the J. H. Mello Company, an investment banking and consulting business, which became known as the Mello Corporation in the mid-1990's. She then became president and chief executive of World Learning Inc., a nonprofit organization with programs in 110 countries. World Learning established a scholarship in her honor shortly before her death.         In 1983, she was a founding member of the Committee of 200, a group of women who are senior corporate executives and entrepreneurs.         Her marriage to Marcus Mello ended in divorce in 1985. Besides her husband, she is survived by three stepchildren; seven stepgrandchildren; and a brother, Ed Hendren of Chico, Calif.         Correction:  October 30, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Friday about Judy Hendren Mello, former president and chief executive of the First Women's Bank in Manhattan, misstated the day of her death. It was last Tuesday, not Oct. 20.       
         Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a pivotal figure in one of the 20th century's great epics -- the struggle for control of post-imperial China waged between the Nationalists and the Communists during the Japanese invasion and the violent aftermath of World War II -- died on Thursday in Manhattan, the Foreign Ministry of Taiwan reported yesterday. She was 105.         Madame Chiang, a dazzling and imperious politician, wielded immense influence in Nationalist China, but she and her husband were eventually forced by the Communist victory into exile in Taiwan, where she presided as the grande dame of Nationalist politics for many years. After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, she retreated to New York City, where she spent the rest of her life.         But her old influence overseas was matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the relentless and sophisticated lobbying effort she and her husband set up in Washington, through which they distributed uncounted millions through law firms and public relations companies to promote Taiwan's cause and maintain recognition by the American government.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband blamed the United States for the Nationalists' loss of China, and continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland. Although that hope eventually faded, American support for Taiwan remained strong for years, delaying Washington's recognition of Beijing as the capital of China until 1979, three decades after the Communists seized power.         As a fluent English speaker, as a Christian, as a model of what many Americans hoped China to become, Madame Chiang struck a chord with American audiences as she traveled across the country, starting in the 1930's, raising money and lobbying for support of her husband's government. She seemed to many Americans to be the very symbol of the modern, educated, pro-American China they yearned to see emerge -- even as many Chinese dismissed her as a corrupt, power-hungry symbol of the past they wanted to escape.         Ultimately, that difference in perspectives was perhaps one reason that she fled an increasingly democratic Taiwan, where many people reviled her and where she felt less at home as native Taiwanese eclipsed the exiled mainlanders.         Madame Chiang was the most famous member of one of modern China's most remarkable families, the Soongs, who dominated Chinese politics and finance in the first half of the 20th century. Yet in China it was her American background and style that distinguished Soong Mei-ling; that was her maiden name, sometimes spelled May-ling.         For many Americans, her finest moment came in 1943, when she barnstormed the United States in search of support for the Nationalist cause against Japan, winning donations from countless Americans who were mesmerized by her passion, determination and striking good looks. Her address to a joint meeting of Congress electrified Washington, winning billions of dollars in aid.         She helped create American policy toward China during the war years, running the Nationalist government's propaganda operation and emerging as its most important diplomat. Yet she was also deeply involved in the endless maneuverings of her husband, who was uneasily at the helm of several shifting alliances with Chinese warlords vying for control of what was then a badly fractured nation.         A devout Christian, Madame Chiang spoke fluent English tinted with the Southern accent she acquired as a schoolgirl in Georgia, and she presented a civilized and humane image of a courageous China battling Japanese invasion and Communist subversion. Yet historians have documented the murderous path that Chiang Kai-shek led in his efforts to win, then keep, and ultimately lose power. It also became clear in later years that the Chiang family had pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid intended for the war.         Madame Chiang had a notoriously tempestuous relationship with her husband, and then with his son by a previous marriage, Chiang Ching-kuo, who became Taiwan's leader after Chiang Kai-shek's death. She had no children.         Her skill as a politician, alternately charming and vicious, made her a formidable presence. She made a play for Taiwan's leadership after Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, even though she was 90 and living in New York.         Although she suffered numerous ailments, including breast cancer, she outlived all her contemporary rivals. She was said to credit her religious faith -- she told friends she rose at dawn for an hour of prayer each day -- for her good health.         Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, who worked closely with her when he commanded American forces in China during the war, described Madame Chiang in his diary as a ''clever, brainy woman.''         ''Direct, forceful, energetic,'' he wrote. ''Loves power, eats up publicity and flattery, pretty weak on her history. Can turn on charm at will and knows it.''         Soong Mei-ling's rise to power began when she married Chiang in an opulent ceremony in Shanghai in 1927, bringing together China's star military man with one of the nation's most illustrious families.         Her eldest sister, Soong Ai-ling, directed the family's affairs and innumerable money-making ventures with the help of her husband, H. H. Kung, a scion of one of China's wealthiest banking families.         Madame Chiang's second sister, Soong Qing-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China's first president after the last emperor was toppled in 1911. After Sun's death, Soong Qing-ling carried his banner over into the Communist camp, causing an irreparable rupture in the family.         When the vanquished Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Soong Qing-ling stayed behind. The Communist Party leadership called her the only true patriot in the Soong family, and appointed her honorary chairman of the People's Republic in 1980, a year before her death.         A Telling Ditty         Today, Chinese still remember the three sisters with a telling ditty: ''One loved money, one loved power, one loved China,'' referring respectively to Ai-ling, Mei-ling and Qing-ling.         Madame Chiang's elder brother, T. V. Soong, often called Nationalist China's financial wizard, served at various times as finance minister, acting prime minister and foreign minister, where his primary role was raising money from America.         Although Madame Chiang developed a stellar image with the American public, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other leaders became disillusioned with her and her husband's despotic and corrupt practices. Eleanor Roosevelt was shocked at her answer when asked at a dinner at the White House how the Chinese government would handle a strike by coal miners. Madame Chiang silently drew a sharp fingernail across her neck.         ''She can talk beautifully about democracy,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said later. ''But she does not know how to live democracy.''         By the end of the war, the loyalty of Nationalist officials melted away as the government grew corrupt and fiscally traitorous, printing money so aggressively that the Chinese currency fell to an exchange rate of several million yuan to the dollar. Many Nationalist soldiers were reduced to begging for food because they went unpaid, yet American diplomats discovered that military supplies sent from the United States to China sometimes appeared on the black market soon after arrival.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland, although That hope eventually faded.         In New York, Madame Chiang lived in an apartment on Gracie Square in Manhattan. In March 1999, as she turned 101, hard of hearing but still quick-witted, she told visitors that she read the Bible and The New York Times every day.         The Soong family's saga, cutting across many strands of modern Chinese history, began when Madame Chiang's father, Charlie Soong, sailed to the United States at the age of 12. Coming from a family of traders in Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Mr. Soong was taken in by Methodists in North Carolina who converted him to Christianity in hopes of sending him back to spread the word of Jesus in China.         After returning to Shanghai in 1886, Mr. Soong, a genial wheeler-dealer, passed up missionary life to start a business printing Bibles, earning a fortune. He also printed political pamphlets secretly for Sun Yat-sen, then working to overthrow China's last emperor. On Jan. 1, 1912, Sun became China's first president.         Sun lasted in office only a few months before his coalition disintegrated, and after he fled to Japan, he hired Mr. Soong's second daughter, Soong Qing-ling, as a secretary. They soon married, despite the age difference: he was 50 and she was 21.         Educated in America         Mei-ling Soong was born in Shanghai on March 5, 1898, although some references give 1897 as the year because Chinese usually consider everyone to be one year old at birth. At the age of 10, she had followed her elder sisters to the Wesleyan College for Women in Macon, Ga.         She entered Wellesley College near Boston in 1913; her brother, T. V., was enrolled at Harvard. She majored in English literature, and was remembered by her classmates as a chubby, vivacious and determined student. She graduated in 1917 and returned to Shanghai speaking English better than Chinese.         She was introduced to her future husband in 1922. By that time, she had matured into a slender beauty and taken to wearing full-length, body-hugging gowns.         Chiang Kai-shek, a severe-looking military aide to Sun who established a school for officers in southern China, may have been as attracted to the Soongs' financial and political connections as he was to their youngest daughter. His initial overtures to her were rebuffed, and after Sun's death in 1925, as Chiang took the title generalissimo and tried to succeed him as the leader of the Nationalist cause, he proposed to Sun's young widow, Soong Qing-ling. She said no.         Chiang allied himself with warlords in southern and central China and with the Soviet Union, where Stalin regarded the Nationalists as more progressive than the warlords who still controlled Beijing and northern China. Communist rebels, not yet led by Mao Zedong, felt they deserved Moscow's support. But Stalin insisted on supporting the Nationalists.         In 1927, Chiang shocked his Soviet backers by carrying out a massacre of leftists in Shanghai. Edgar Snow, the American journalist, estimated that Chiang's forces had executed more than 5,000 people.         The massacre caused a permanent rent in the Soong family. Soong Qing-ling, as Sun's widow, led a faction of Nationalists who voted to expel Chiang from all his posts. T. V. Soong resigned as finance minister, though he was later persuaded to resume his alliance with Chiang.         When Chiang renewed his interest in Soong Mei-ling in 1927, she told him that she would consent to marry only if he could win the approval of her mother, who had reservations about a man who was neither Christian nor single. Chiang had already fathered a son in a marriage that was arranged when he was only 14, and had adopted a second son and married a second wife, Chen Chieh-ru. Chiang promised to convert, and eventually sent Chen away to the United States, where she enrolled at Columbia University and earned a doctorate.         The Chiang-Soong wedding took place in Shanghai on Dec. 1, 1927. A small Christian ceremony was held at the Soong mansion on Seymour Road, followed by a political ceremony at the Majestic Hotel, beneath a portrait of Sun.         As a political partner to her husband, Madame Chiang developed what she called the New Life Movement, a series of principles for modernizing China through social discipline, courtesy and service. She engineered public hygiene campaigns and denounced traditional superstitions.         While many ordinary Chinese resisted it, the campaign was popular with foreigners, particularly with Henry Luce, the publisher of Time magazine, who was born to missionaries in China. A longtime supporter of the Chiangs, Luce named the couple ''Man and Woman of the Year'' in 1938.         During the war with the Japanese, Madame Chiang pushed her husband to build up the Nationalist air force, and helped hire Claire Chennault, who commanded a mercenary force of pilots that came to be known as the Flying Tigers.         During World War II, the relationship between General Stilwell, Chiang and Madame Chiang proved contentious. The general accused Chiang of hoarding resources, deliberately avoiding battle with the Japanese to spare his men to fight the Communists.         Madame Chiang was in the middle, sometimes interceding on General Stilwell's behalf when resisting him threatened American support. But she also plotted against the general, telling journalists that he was incompetent. She and her husband lobbied Washington to have him replaced, and he was, in 1944.         After Japan was defeated in 1945 and the civil war between Nationalists and Communists accelerated, the Communists swiftly expanded their control into the northeast.         The governing Nationalists received considerable American aid, but American officials in China warned of vast amounts of graft among Nationalists. More than $3 billion was appropriated to China during the war, and most of it was transmitted through T. V. Soong, who as China's foreign minister was based in Washington. It later became apparent that the Soong family suffered vicious infighting over the purloined funds.         Madame Chiang traveled to Washington again in November 1948 to plead for emergency aid for the war against the Communists. Yet Congress had recently assigned $1 billion more to China, and President Truman was impatient with the Chiangs and what had become an apparently hopeless effort to shore up the Nationalist government. Madame Chiang never returned to China.         ''I can ask the American people for nothing more,'' she said. ''It is either in your hearts to love us, or your hearts have been turned from us.''         In her frustration, she publicly likened American politics to ''clodhopping boorishness.'' Coming after years of generous American support, that irritated Truman.         ''They're thieves, every damn one of them,'' Truman said later, referring to Nationalist leaders. ''They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it's invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.''         General Chiang resigned as president of Nationalist China in January 1949 and fled to Taiwan that May, taking with him a national art collection that was kept in crates in Taiwan for years as the Chiangs clung to the ever-diminishing hope that they would some day take it back to Beijing.         Over the years, Madame Chiang's health wavered, and in 1976 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy, and later, a second one.         Her Final Years         Even after she moved to permanent residence in New York, she kept her finger on the pulse of Nationalist politics. She returned to Taiwan after her stepson died in January 1988. Even though she was nearly 90, she tried to rally her old allies. But Lee Teng-hui, chosen as vice president both because he was Taiwan-born and because he was considered a pushover by fellow Nationalists, proved more adept at politics than expected, and he gradually solidified his control.         Madame Chiang lived out her final years in New York, with a pack of black-suited bodyguards who cleared the lobby of her Gracie Square apartment building every time she entered or left. She returned to Congress for one last appearance in 1995.         Until this year, Madame Chiang maintained an annual tradition of receiving a few friends at her Manhattan apartment on her birthday. But this year, she came down with pneumonia, and was was unable to do that, the local Chinese press reported.         Her last public appearance was believed to be in January 2000, when she attended an exhibition of her watercolor paintings of traditional Chinese landscapes at the Queens headquarters of the World Journal, a prominent local Chinese newspaper. She was in a wheelchair, but was reported to be in good spirits, telling people there that she was very happy that day.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek on Oct. 25 and in some late editions on Oct. 24 referred imprecisely to her attempt to influence political control in Taiwan in 1988, after the death of her stepson, Chiang Ching-kuo, who had been president as well as chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party. Mme. Chiang tried unsuccessfully to block his successor as president, Lee Teng-hui, from succeeding him as chairman; she did not seek office for herself, nor was she eligible to do so.       
         Rosalie Allen, who came out of Pennsylvania coal country to become a popular singing cowgirl and yodeler in New York, where she was also the city's only country D.J. for a while, died on Sept. 23 in Palmdale, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure that followed diabetes and other ailments, said a friend, Alois Krtil. At the time of her death she used the name Julia Gilbert, with the surname being that of her last husband, Mr. Krtil said.         Miss Allen became known as Queen of the Yodelers after winning a national yodeling contest in 1939. As a singer her style was likened to Patsy Montana, and one of her most successful recordings was a version for RCA Victor of Montana's hit ''I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart.''         She was also known for her yodeling duets with Elton Britt. Two of their hits were ''Beyond the Sunset (Should You Go First)'' and ''Quicksilver.''         In September 1947, Miss Allen was part of the first country concert at Carnegie Hall, along with Ernest Tubb, Minnie Pearl and others. In the mid-1940's she became a partner in Rosalie Allen's Hillbilly Music Center on West 54th Street, one of the first record stores in the United States to sell only country music.         Miss Allen was perhaps best known to New Yorkers for playing host on the radio program ''Prairie Stars'' on WOV from 1944 to 1956. She parlayed her broadcast appeal into nightly live shows at the Village Barn, a national radio show, a local television show and an Armed Forces Radio Network show.         In an article about her radio career, The New York Times in 1946 called Miss Allen ''a rare four-leafed clover in a field that was one of man's last strongholds.''         Julia Marlene Bedra was born on June 27, 1924, in Old Forge, Pa. She was one of 12 children and her father was a chiropractor, according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.         By the time she was 9 she was working as a dishwasher to help pay family expenses. Listening to the radio inspired her to learn to sing, yodel and play her brother's guitar. She made her radio debut in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and then headed for York, Pa., where she was the featured vocalist with Shorty Fincher's Prairie Pals.         In 1943 she came to New York to sing on Denver Darling's ''Swing Billies'' radio show. According to an article in The Daily News earlier this year, she stalled for three months because she was frightened of the big city. But the chance to raise her pay from $15 a week to $98 ended her hesitation.         She moved in with a sister in Brooklyn and soon she was making $300 a week. In 1944 she became a regular on Zeb Carver's ''Hill Country Jamboree'' show, where her sunny personality prompted WOV to recruit her for a half-hour nightly show of her own.         By 1946 she was on the air up to two hours a night, singing and presenting guests like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Eddy Arnold and Hank Williams. In the late 1940's she became host of a local country show on NBC-TV.         As rock 'n' roll pushed country aside, she moved to Alabama and performed less, even though Montana urged her to return to the recording studio, according to Mr. Krtil. He said she was stopped by a combination of health and marital problems, as well as by disputes with Nashville producers.         Miss Allen had strong opinions about country music and wrote articles and columns for publications like National Jamboree, Country Sound Roundup and Hoedown. For example, in the Times interview, she expressed regret that so much ''New York corn'' was being substituted for fine Southern mountain music in the local scene.         She also differentiated between hillbilly and cowboy music, calling hillbilly a twangy novelty. She said, ''I think that people who don't like cowboy music are often those who can't face reality.''         Among the fan mail she received were not a few marriage proposals. Her answer to these epistles was usually enough to dissuade potential suitors: Mrs. Malcolm McGlasson.         She was unmarried at her death, and is survived by her daughter, Dorothy Bunch of Palmdale.       
         Dr. Margaret A. Johns, who showed that pheromones can set off hormonal changes in mammals when they activate receptors in a tiny nasal cavity, a process that can attract animals of the opposite sex, died Saturday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 75.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter Sara Johns Griffen.         Scientists had known of the nasal structure, called the vomeronasal organ, on each side of the nasal septum, for more than a century. But it was widely believed that the organ had gradually become functionless and that the odorless chemical messages known as pheromones were detected instead by the olfactory system.         Dr. Johns's research, published in the journal Nature in 1978, led other scientists to question, and later debunk, the long-held notion that humans were incapable of sensing pheromones.         In recent years, research has suggested that the vomeronasal organ acts on the human brain in its hypothalamus, which produces hormones and regulates appetite, anxiety, fear and other behaviors.         In her experiment, Dr. Johns, a graduate student at the time, found that female rats would start to ovulate if exposed to an outside stimulus, like male urine. She then blocked off the vomeronasal organ in several female rats and repeated the procedure. This time, the urine had no effect, suggesting that the pheromones were acting not on the sense of smell, but on the organ many assumed had no real purpose.         ''There was evidence of pheromone communication in insects and invertebrates, but she was the first one to find it in mammals,'' said Dr. Louis Monti-Bloch, who worked on studies in the early 1990's proving that pheromones can induce behavioral changes in humans. ''That inspired studies that explored whether these same pheromones were having an effect in humans.''         Today, scientists are developing synthetic pheromones that could have a range of medical uses, like relieving anxiety and easing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.         Born in Boston, Margaret Anne Johns earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College, but not until she was in her late 30's, after she had raised two children. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University.         In the early 1980's, she did research at Mount Sinai in New York showing that cells within the pituitary gland could absorb serotonin. Her paper, published in the journal Endocrinology in 1982, suggested that the hormone might have an effect on the anterior pituitary gland in mammals, which helps to regulate growth and ovulation, among other things.         Whether serotonin influences the anterior pituitary is an issue that many scientists debate to this day, said Dr. Marc Freeman, a professor of biological science and neuroscience at Florida State University.         Dr. Johns's first marriage, to Craig Johns, ended in divorce in the early 80's.         In addition to her daughter Sara, who lives in Kinderhook, N.Y., she is survived by her husband, H. Peter Stern; another daughter, Kate Johns, of Old Chatham, N.Y.; a brother, Stephen Bush of San Pedro, Calif.; three stepchildren; and eight grandchildren.       
         Wendy Marx, who became the spokeswoman of a foundation named for her after being saved by a liver transplant, died on Tuesday in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Francisco.         The cause was hepatitis B, which once again flared in Ms. Marx's system and attacked her liver, her brother Jeffrey said. She received her first transplant in 1990 and a second in 1992, after another flare-up of hepatitis. She had been No. 1 on the waiting list for a new liver of her blood type for a month before her death, Mr. Marx said.         In 1990, the Wendy Marx Foundation for Organ Donor Awareness was established by the Marx siblings and the Olympic sprinter Carl Lewis, with whom Mr. Marx was cooperating on a book.         Among other educational activities, the foundation published a book by Mr. Marx, a 1986 Pulitzer Prize-winner, called ''It Gets Dark Sometimes: My Sister's Fight to Live and Save Lives'' (Jam Publishing, 2000).         Wendy Elizabeth Marx was born in Manhattan on June 7, 1967, and grew up in Rye Brook, N.Y. She graduated cum laude from Duke University in 1989 and headed for San Francisco to start a career in marketing.         Soon after arriving, she contracted hepatitis B, which quickly worsened. At one point she was in a coma and was given 24 hours to live.         Mr. Marx and Mr. Lewis decided to start the foundation regardless of what happened to Ms. Marx. After she received a last-minute organ donation and recovered, she joined the initiative. In 2000, Ms. Marx married E. David Ellington.         In addition to Mr. Ellington, of San Francisco, and Jeffrey Marx, who lives in Washington, D.C., she is survived by her mother, Peggy Marx of Lake Worth, Fla.; her father, Richard, of Bedford, N.Y., and another brother, James, of White Plains, N.Y.       
         Janice Rule, an actress in film and onstage who became a psychoanalyst late in her career, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         Born in Norwood, Ohio, Ms. Rule studied ballet and began dancing in Chicago nightclubs in her teens. She soon attracted attention in Hollywood and made her film debut in 1951 in ''Goodbye, My Fancy,'' with Joan Crawford and Robert Young.         She was pictured on the cover of Life magazine on Jan. 8, 1951, as a rising young actress. Her films in the 1950's included ''Starlift,'' ''Holiday for Sinners,'' ''A Woman's Devotion'' and ''Bell, Book and Candle,'' in which she was the strait-laced fiancée who loses James Stewart.         In 1953 Ms. Rule was in the original cast of William Inge's ''Picnic,'' which was Paul Newman's Broadway debut. She played Madge Owens, the naïve beauty.         Among her other Broadway shows were ''The Flowering Peach,'' ''The Happiest Girl in the World'' and Michael V. Gazzo's ''Night Circus,'' a 1958 production with Ben Gazzara, whom she later married. That marriage ended in divorce, as had her previous marriages to N. Richard Nash and Robert Thom.         Ms. Rule was also in the film ''The Swimmer'' in 1968, with Burt Lancaster, and Robert Altman's ''3 Women'' in 1977, with Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek.         During the 1960's she became interested in psychoanalysis. She began studying it in 1973 and received a Ph.D. 10 years later from the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in Los Angeles. She practiced in New York and Los Angeles and continued to act occasionally.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Thom Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gazzara, both of Brooklyn; her sisters, Kathleen Rule, of Oceano, Calif.; Ann Nader, of San Marcos, Calif.; and Emily Forbes, of Las Cruces, N.M.; and her brother Ralph, of Mallorca, Spain.       
         Katharine Thomas O'Neil Bidwell, a patron of music and education who headed the Metropolitan Opera Guild in the 1980's, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66 and also had a home on Fishers Island, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bidwell was born in Dayton, Ohio, and started a musical career when she joined the St. Louis Municipal Opera at 18. She graduated in 1959 from Sarah Lawrence College, where she became a trustee and sponsored programs in the performing arts.         She joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1966, became first vice president in the late 1970's and was president and chief executive from 1979 to 1986. After that, until 1996, she was the Lincoln Center's director of special projects.         For many years Mrs. Bidwell also headed the advisory council at the New York City Opera. She founded the Katherine Bidwell Foundation for Young Singers and the patrons' program of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped in commissioning new works.         She was also a trustee of the Greenwall Foundation, which supports emerging artists, Westminster Choir College and the London School of Music and Dramatic Arts.         el1 Mrs. Bidwell's first marriage, to Stephen E. O'Neil, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, J. Truman Bidwell Jr.; a daughter, Molly O'Neil Frank, of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen T. O'Neil, of Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and Charles Thomas O'Neil, of Stockbridge, Mass.; a brother, Charles Thomas, of San Diego; a sister, Frances Martin, of St. Louis; and eight grandchildren.       
         Patricia Broderick, a writer and painter who was the mother of the actor Matthew Broderick, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her son said.         Raised in Manhattan on the Upper East Side but a devotee of the bohemian Village, Ms. Broderick had a wide range of interests and callings. An artist in her teens, she began writing plays in the 1940's; several were performed in New York and London, sometimes featuring her husband, the actor James Broderick, who died in 1982.         In 1996, her film, ''Infinity,'' a love story based on the life of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, was released to generally good reviews and was shown at the Toronto Film Festival. The film was a family affair; Matthew Broderick both directed and starred. Ms. Broderick also worked on the script of ''Glory,'' the 1989 Civil War drama, which starred her son as a young commander in charge of an all-black regiment.         Ms. Broderick continued painting and had her work shown in several galleries in New York and across the country, both in solo shows and with the work of her partner of the last six years, the painter John Wesley.         In addition to Mr. Wesley and her son, Ms. Broderick is survived by two daughters, the Rev. Janet Broderick Kraft and Martha Broderick; a brother, Richard Biow; and five grandchildren.       
         Jane Evans, a former top executive of several large companies and most recently the managing partner of the Directors' Council, a company she helped form this year to help companies find women and members of minorities to serve as directors, died Nov. 16 in Buenos Aires, where she was attending a business conference.         She was 59 and lived in Paradise Valley, Ariz.         The cause apparently was bacterial pneumonia, said her husband, George Sheer.         Ms. Evans, at one time regarded as a prodigy in the field of traditional women's apparel retailing, more recently was associated with relative newcomers like Hypercom, an international provider of electronic payment and card processing systems.         At her death she was a director of Hypercom, Georgia-Pacific, the KB Home Corporation and the Altria Group, formerly Philip Morris.         She had been a Philip Morris board member since 1981, when she was the executive vice president leading the sprawling fashion group of General Mills, later spun off as Crystal Brands.         Jane Pierce Evans was born in Hannibal, Mo., and graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1965. A few days before her graduation, Genesco recruited Ms. Evans for executive training.         She rose from assistant to buyer for stockings, handbags and shoes. She became fashion coordinator for all the shoes sold by Genesco's shoe-making subsidiary, I. Miller, to Sears, Miller's No. 1 outlet. By the time she was 25, in 1970, she was named president of I. Miller.         Three and a half years later, Ms. Evans became president of Butterick Fashion Marketing, makers of zippers and sewing patterns sold under the Butterick and Vogue names; its corporate parent was American Can.         She left American Can and Butterick in 1977, saying they had become incompatible with her long-term career in women's apparel.         She went to lead the apparel group of General Mills where, as an executive vice president, she was responsible for fashion labels like Izod Lacoste, Ship 'n Shore and Monet Jewelers.         A headline in The New York Times in 1982 described her as ''The Number One Woman on Seventh Avenue.'' That year she joined women who were top executives across the corporate spectrum in the Committee of 200, founded as a power base for women in business.         In 1984, she became president and chief executive officer of Monet, a big maker of quality costume jewelry, and stayed on when General Mills spun off its fashion components. But in 1987, she suddenly resigned to look for other opportunities, she said.         Ms. Evans shifted fields to investment banking, becoming a general partner in Montgomery Securities of San Francisco.         But she returned to retailing in 1989 as president and chief executive of the Interpacific Group, an operator of hundreds of specialty stores under various names at resorts in Hawaii and the Far East.         Later, she was also chief operating officer of Gamut Interactive, a new-media service company in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was a member of senior management at US West Communications and, most recently, was associated with Opnix, of Tempe, Ariz., an Internet technology start-up.         Her last major project, the Directors' Council, was established this year in Phoenix and New York. Other founders included Christie Hefner of Playboy Enterprises, Marilyn R. Seymann of M One and Kay Koplovitz, former chief executive of USA Networks.         Besides Mr. Sheer, her husband of 33 years, Ms. Evans is survived by a son, Jonathan, of Tokyo; her mother, Kay Pierce of Columbus, Ohio; a sister, Judy Thompson, also of Columbus; and a brother, James Evans of Richmond, Va.       
         C. Z. Guest, one of the monarchs of New York society who was a perennial selection on the best-dressed list, a noted horsewoman and an authority on gardening, died yesterday at home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 83.         Mrs. Guest's interest in horticulture began when she was a child following the family gardener around her parents' estate on the North Shore of Boston. Her name then was Lucy Douglas Cochrane, but she soon became C. Z. when her brother, Alexander, could not pronounce ''sister.'' Embarking on a writing career relatively late in life, she was the author of books on gardening and a children's book, ''Tiny Green Thumbs.'' She also wrote a syndicated weekly column that appeared in 350 newspapers across the nation.         Mrs. Guest began her writing career while recovering from a horseback riding accident in 1976. While she was convalescing, frequent telephone calls from friends about their gardening problems prompted her first book, ''First Garden,'' which was illustrated by her ''very dear friend'' Cecil Beaton and which had an introduction by another ''dear, dear friend,'' Truman Capote.         In his introduction, Capote described Mrs. Guest working in her garden: ''There, with her baskets and spades and clippers, and wearing her funny boyish shoes, and with her sunborne sweat soaking her eyes, she is a part of the sky and the earth, possibly a not too significant part, but a part.''         Beaton and Capote were only two in a legion of celebrities and jet-setters who surrounded Mrs. Guest throughout her vivid life. When she was married in 1947 to Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, an international polo star, heir to the Phipps steel fortune and a second cousin of Winston Churchill, the ceremony was held at the home of Ernest Hemingway in Cuba, with Hemingway serving as best man.         Until Mr. Guest's death in 1982, the couple was prominent in international social circles, hunting in India with the Maharaja of Jaipur and frequently entertaining the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who subsequently became godparents of their children, Cornelia and Alexander.         C. Z. Guest was considered one of America's classic beauties. The writer Jill Gerston once described her this way: ''With her pale skin, blue eyes, ash-blond hair and trim figure, she is cut from the same cool, silky cloth as Grace Kelly. It is a patrician beauty that is indigenous to socially registered enclaves like Palm Beach and Southampton, a sporty, outdoorsy look that eschews makeup, hairspray and anything trendy. She has an outspoken, coolly self-assured manner and a throaty, well-modulated voice with a trace of a British accent.''         In 1962, Time magazine did a lengthy article on American society and apotheosized Mrs. Guest on its cover as the model of horsy high society. She posed in front of her Long Island estate wearing a button-down shirt and tie and jodhpurs, a sleek hound at her side, the personification of old-guard chic. Truman Capote once described Mrs. Guest as the incarnation of understated elegance and said she was ''a cool vanilla lady.'' John Fairchild, then publisher of Women's Wear Daily, described her as ''Southampton, Long Island American, Ivy League blond.'' British Vogue said she had ''the face of a flower.''         Often adorned by Mainbocher, Givenchy and Adolfo, she was chosen by the New York Dress Institute as one of the best-dressed women in the world early in the 1950's and remained on the list for years until her elevation to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Guest was also the designer of a small fashion collection introduced in 1985 and at the time made up principally of cashmere sweaters. ''I will only sell what I like to wear,'' she said after her sweaters had been displayed flung casually around the shoulders of models at the semiannual show of the designer Adolfo. A limited sportswear line was licensed in 1986 and in 1990 she came out with a fragrant insect repellent spray and other garden products.         Lucy Douglas Cochrane was born in Boston on Feb. 19, 1920, the second of five children of Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker, and Vivian Cochrane, the former Vivian Wessell. Her father died when she was 6. She was educated by tutors and later graduated from the Fermata School in Aiken, S.C. She made her debut in 1937, and was voted the glamour girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a contest held in 1939, which prompted a brief fling as a showgirl. She appeared in a 1943 revue on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and in a revival of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway in 1944. She spent six months in Hollywood attending 20th Century Fox's studio school but never appeared in a film.         ''My ambition was to be a successful enough actress to get myself thrown out of the Social Register,'' she once said. ''I had no talent at all but I enjoyed every minute of my experience.'' It was also during this period that she took off for Mexico, where Diego Rivera painted her as a nude odalisque. When she became engaged to Mr. Guest, her portrait, which had reportedly been displayed in a Mexico City bar, was bought by her fiancé's family.         Mrs. Guest became interested in volunteer work as a debutante in Boston and was active in numerous charitable organizations over the years, including the Children's Research and Asthma Institute, the Police Athletic League and the March of Dimes.         For years she was chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball and was a favorite of society columnists, who often mentioned her lunching with such friends as Elsa Maxwell, Mrs. William Paley, Mrs. Earl Smith, Doris Duke and Estée Lauder. They also mentioned her riding in the hunt country of Virginia, taking in the polo matches at the Piping Rock Club on Long Island, working hard on her orchids in her greenhouses or walking the grounds of Templeton, her estate on Long Island, trailed by a string of hunting dogs.         During the 1930's and 40's she was one of society's leading hostesses. ''She was very comfortable with all kinds of people, which is not common for a woman who's born to the purple, so to speak,'' her friend Eppie Lederer (the advice columnist Ann Landers) once observed.         The Guests jointly owned racing stables, with Mr. Guest supervising those in Chantilly, France, and Mrs. Guest supervising others in Middleburg, Va.. She loved exercising her horses and did so most mornings. For years she competed in the leading horse shows.         In 1984, Mrs. Guest was named commissioner general of the American garden exhibit of the International Garden Festival in Liverpool, England. The project, jointly sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the United States Forest Service, was a memorial to members of the Army Air Force who were killed in World War II.         Mrs. Guest was amused when her daughter, Cornelia was hailed by Life magazine as ''the debutante of the year'' in 1982 and herself became the darling of columnists and photographers.         In addition to her son Alexander, of Hunterdon County, N.J., and her daughter, Cornelia, of Old Westbury, she is survived by two stepsons, Winston Guest of Palm Beach, and Frederick, of New York, and three grandchildren.         ''I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend,'' C.Z. Guest once said.

         Linda C. Quinn, a specialist in securities law and an influential force at the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1980's and 1990's, died on Tuesday in Dalton, Mass.         Her brother, Michael, said the cause of death was breast cancer. Ms. Quinn was 55 and had residences in Manhattan and Sharon, Conn.         During her 16 years at the S.E.C., Ms. Quinn oversaw regulatory changes that reduced barriers to foreign investment in the United States.         ''She was my most trusted adviser,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the S.E.C., said in a telephone interview.         Ms. Quinn joined the S.E.C. in 1980 and became executive assistant to the chairman, John Shad. She served as director of the division of corporation finance from 1986 to 1996.         Her principal legacies at the commission were a rule that made it easier for domestic and foreign institutional investors to buy and sell debt securities in the United States, and a regulation that streamlined the securities-offering process and made important changes to, and interpretations of, the S.E.C.'s disclosure rules.         In addition, Ms. Quinn's division set up Edgar, the S.E.C.'s electronic reporting system for public issuers of debt and equity securities.         She left the S.E.C. to join Shearman & Sterling as a partner. There she was an adviser to corporations on securities and capital markets matters.         ''I think she was the most important regulator and authority on securities regulation in the last 25 years,'' said David W. Heleniak, senior partner at Shearman & Sterling.         Ms. Quinn, who was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Mount Holyoke College. She earned her law degree at the Georgetown University Law Center.         She is survived by her brother.         Correction:  November 15, 2003, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Linda C. Quinn, a former official at the Securities and Exchange Commission, omitted a survivor. In addition to her brother, Michael, Ms. Quinn is survived by her father, E. John Quinn, of Amenia, N.Y.       
         Jenifer Estess, a theatrical producer who set up a foundation for research into Lou Gehrig's disease after she learned she had it, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., as Lou Gehrig's disease is formally known, her sister Valerie Estess said.         Ms. Estess was told in 1997 that she had the condition, a degenerative disease of the nerve cells that control muscular movement. It affects 30,000 Americans and is usually fatal within two to five years.         With friends and family members, Ms. Estess set up Project A.L.S., and, calling on her experience as a producer, she raised more than $17 million and brought together scientists from different laboratories to cooperate in the search for a cure.         The foundation paid for investigations into genetics, stem cells, gene therapy, accelerated drug testing and disease pathways. Some new approaches may help those with related conditions, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as brain and spinal cord injury, her sister said.         Jenifer Greer Estess was born on Feb. 17, 1963, in Moline, Ill., and grew up in Harrison, N.Y. After graduating from New York University with a major in drama, she worked as an actor. She helped found and was producing director of Naked Angels, a Manhattan theater company.         She then worked in public relations and helped found the Nantucket Film Festival and the New York Women's Film Festival.         Project A.L.S. has staged benefits involving show business celebrities in New York and Los Angeles, and in 2002 it arranged for Project A.L.S. Day at 14 major-league baseball stadiums. At each event, a celebrity read Gehrig's famous farewell speech, in which he declared to Yankee fans that he considered himself ''the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''         In 2001, Ms. Estess produced a movie for CBS television called ''Jenifer'' that told her own story. That year, she was named Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year.         Next May, HBO is planning to show a documentary about her.         The publication of her memoir, ''Tales From the Bed: On Living, Dying and Having It All,'' is scheduled for May.         Project A.L.S. will continue, Valerie Estess said.         In addition to her sister Valerie, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Estess is survived by her mother, Marilyn R. Estess, of Rye, N.Y.; her other sisters, Alison Estess of Manhattan and Meredith Hulbert of Harrison; and her brother, Noah, of San Diego.       
         Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the National Brain Tumor Foundation, died on Nov. 30 in San Francisco, where she made her home. She was 57.         The cause was complications of pneumonia and of a brain tumor first diagnosed in 1979, her family said.         The foundation was formed in 1981 as a support group bringing together brain tumor patients, doctors and medical researchers. Ms. Stevenson organized the office of executive director in 1985 as the group expanded its fund-raising efforts for patient care and the search for a cure.         She stepped down in 1989 but remained a consultant and was on the board at her death.         Elizabeth Fullerton Stevenson was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa.; graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; and in 1968 received a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford. She worked at KQED, the public television station in Los Angeles, before heading to New York, where she became an assistant in the office of Mayor John V. Lindsay before returning to California in 1973.         There she worked for Representative Paul N. McCloskey as office manager and for Santa Clara County as director of governmental relations. From 1978 to 1982, she was director of public affairs for the Cowles Media Company in Minneapolis.         Ms. Stevenson was also a former member of the board of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.         She is survived by her husband, Francisco Cancino; two sisters, Sally S. Fischer, who lives in France, and Patience S. Scott of Riverhead, N.Y.; a brother, John R. Stevenson Jr. of Woodacre, Calif.; and her stepmother, Ruth Carter Stevenson of Fort Worth.         Correction:  January 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 19 about Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the Brain Tumor Foundation, misstated the location of the public television station KQED, for which she once worked. It is in San Francisco, not Los Angeles.       
         Gladys Shelley, a prolific songwriter whose ballad ''How Did He Look?'' became a cabaret standard and whose jingle for Palisades Amusement Park once saturated the airwaves in the New York area, died on Dec. 9 at home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Her death was reported by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which licenses her songs.         Ms. Shelley wrote the lyrics for more than 300 songs. ''How Did He Look?,'' which she wrote with Abner Silver, was her first hit and her most frequently recorded song. First recorded by Joan Merrill in 1941, it was later sung by Connie Francis, Eydie Gorme, Dakota Staton and others, including Mel Tormé and Vic Damone, who sang it as ''How Did She Look?''         Early in her career she wrote a few songs with Fred Astaire and provided words for Morton Gould's ''Pavanne,'' from his ''American Symphonette No. 2.'' ''There Shall Be No Night,'' another of her collaborations with Silver, was recorded by the singer Herb Jeffries with the Duke Ellington Orchestra in 1940.         But it is likely that none of Ms. Shelley's songs reached as wide an audience as ''Come On Over,'' one of the few for which she wrote both music and words. Sung by Steve Clayton, it was prominently featured in radio and television commercials for Palisades Amusement Park, in both Cliffside Park and Fort Lee, N.J., across the Hudson from Manhattan.         First heard in 1965, ''Come On Over'' remained the amusement park's theme song until 1971, when it closed. Palisades Amusement Park, which Ms. Shelley celebrated as a place that ''swings all day and after dark,'' was owned by her husband, Irving Rosenthal, who died in 1973.         She is survived by her brother, George Shaskan, of Chevy Chase, Md.         Ms. Shelley began submitting short poems to Walter Winchell and other newspaper columnists while attending high school in Lawrence, N.Y. She briefly worked as an actress and dancer before trying her hand at song lyrics in the late 1930's.         She occasionally wrote for the theater and the movies, though without much success. ''The Duchess Misbehaves,'' a musical comedy for which she wrote the book and lyrics, ran for three performances at the Adelphi Theater in Manhattan in 1946. That same year she wrote the story for ''Idea Girl,'' a low-budget movie set in the music publishing industry that quickly came and went.         But her heart belonged to Tin Pan Alley and to the New York cabaret scene. ''How Did He Look?'' was a longtime fixture of that scene, and so was Ms. Shelley.         The cabaret historian James Gavin recalled her as an eye-catching presence who as late as the 1990's was known for showing up with large groups of friends wherever her material was being performed, and who, with her ''long dyed-blond hair hanging almost to her waist'' and ''a skirt cut way above her knees,'' invariably got as much attention as the performer. She was an equally memorable presence in her East Side neighborhood, where the sight of Ms. Shelley walking her five chihuahuas was a familiar one for many years.       
         Helen Gustafson, a tea buyer and author who championed fine tea, pushed it onto the menu at Chez Panisse and other restaurants and taught the art of the afternoon tea, died on Dec. 14 at her home here. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Clair Gustafson.         She was ''the Alice Waters of the tea movement,'' said a friend, Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet magazine and former restaurant critic of The New York Times, in a reference to the founder of Chez Panisse.         Ms. Gustafson was tea's ambassador at a time when diners sipped French roast and other strong coffees but thought tea was limited to Lipton.         Two decades ago ''it was quite impossible to find a good cup of tea anywhere in America,'' James Norwood Pratt, the international tea authority and author, said last week. ''Now, it is only highly unlikely. The difference is Helen Gustafson.''         So many restaurateurs made pilgrimages to Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where Ms. Gustafson managed the tea service, that ''it had a ripple effect,'' Mr. Pratt said.         Ms. Gustafson, the author of ''The Agony of the Leaves: The Ecstasy of My Life with Tea'' and ''The Green Tea User's Manual,'' even organized tea parties in Berkeley, a center of political radicalism, at which she requested that women wear gloves and hats.         ''People who a decade before were chanting 'Two-four-six-eight, organize and smash the state!' would get dressed up and go to Helen's,'' said Kate Coleman, a journalist who was a leader in the Free Speech Movement of 1964.         Ms. Waters credited Ms. Gustafson with taking Chez Panisse's tea offerings ''to a different place,'' but described the relationship as ''rocky to the end.'' Sometimes Ms. Gustafson would awaken dishwashers on Sunday mornings to ask why the iron teapots had not been turned upside down to dry. She was fired several times but always refused to leave, her husband said.         Born in Minneapolis on Nov. 25, 1929, Ms. Gustafson grew up enjoying afternoon tea in the sunroom of her red brick house with her mother and grandmother. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in Scandinavian drama from the University of Minnesota.         She swept onto the food scene in the early 1970's when she became a hostess at the Swallow, a restaurant at the University of California Art Museum in Berkeley. ''I had the impression she was running it,'' Ms. Waters said, adding, ''It was a collective.''         When Ms. Gustafson, in vintage clothes and with a gardenia in her hair, began acting as hostess at Chez Panisse, she was so appalled by the Earl Grey on the menu that she confronted Ms. Waters, who gave her license to do something about it. Ms. Gustafson introduced teas like Yunnan, Assam and lemon verbena.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son, Paul, of Berkeley; a daughter, Jill, of Boston; and a brother, John, of Liverpool, N.Y.         A month before she died, friends gave Ms. Gustafson a final tea party at Chez Panisse. ''I've never seen so many people with thermometers fussing over water and how long it had to be boiled,'' said the general manager, Gilbert Pilgram.
