         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         The Rev. Marilyn Adams Moore, an executive with the United Church of Christ, died Jan. 3 at her home in Dayton, N.J. She was 57 years old.         She died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Ms. Moore had served as secretary for racial and social justice with the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ since 1988. She worked on programs to help the clergy and laity respond to social issues and initiated programs to help immigrant women and the homeless.         Before that, she was assistant minister of St. Alban's Congregational Church in Queens.         A graduate of New York Theological Seminary, Ms. Moore was ordained in 1982. She also held positions with the National Council of Churches and the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. She was a member of the Central Jersey Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         She is survived by two daughters, Sharon-Frances and Meredith, both of Dayton; and two brothers, Edward B. Adams of Austin, Tex., and Dr. Clarence Lancelot Adams of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Rosenman, an authority on housing and a lifelong advocate of low-cost housing, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She began her public-housing activites in the 1920's when she was asked by Ira Robbins, chairman of the housing committee of the United Neighborhood Houses, which represented all the settlement housing in New York City, to help amend the old tenement laws.         Throughout her career, she worked to make the public and legislators aware of the need for community improvement and planning.  Housing for War Workers         In 1933, Mrs. Rosenman became chairwoman of the investment housingcommittee of the Citizens Housing Council of New York and, on its formation in 1941, she was named chairwoman of the National Committee on Housing, where she championed emergency housing for war workers. She spent the early part of World War II in Washington, urging the War Department to release critical materials for emergency housing.         In addition to many magazine articles, she was the author of "A Million Homes a Year," (Harcourt Brace, 1945) and, with her husband, Samuel I. Rosenman, an adviser to Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, she wrote "Some Giants and a Pygmy in the White House," (Harper & Row, 1976). Mr. Rosenman died in 1973.         She was born Dorothy Ruben in Manhattan and graduated from the Montessori Training School in 1918, supplementing her education with studies at Columbia University.         Mrs. Rosenman is survived by two sons, James Rowen and Robert Rosenman, both of Manhattan; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Frances Arick Kolb, an education consultant who worked to shape public school curriculums that would encourage achievement by girls and minorities, died last Saturday at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 53 years old and lived in Marlborough.         Dr. Kolb died of breast cancer, said Max McConkey, director of The Network Inc., of Andover, Mass.         She had been associated with The Network, a nonprofit research and training organization since 1980. She was also associate director of the New England Center for Equity Assistance, a federally supported program to provide help to schools dealing with desegregation.         An advocate of textbooks reflecting the contributions of women and minorities, she was the producer of a video directed toward people of Hispanic descent, "Breaking Through -- Portraits of Winners." She also wrote several books including "Portraits of Our Mothers; Using Oral History in the Classroom" (The Network Inc., 1983).         She was a founder and former board member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Organization for Women.         Dr. Kolb was born in Worcester, Mass., and graduated in 1958 from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1972 she earned a Ph.D. in American history there.         She is survived by her husband, Alfred, professor of the humanities at Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester; her mother, Beth Arick of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Sharon Cohen, also of Brookline, and a brother, Martin R. Arick of Newton, Mass.       
         Princess Ileana of Romania, who was known as Mother Alexandra after becoming a nun, died at midday yesterday in St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, Mother Christophora, abbess of the Monastery of the Holy Transfiguration, said.         An aunt of former King Michael of Romania, she was 82 years old and had been a nun at the monastery, which is a community of nuns of the Orthodox Church in America in Ellwood City in western Pennsylvania, for 22 years.         Mother Alexandra, who founded the convent in 1968 and was its abbess from 1969 to 1980, fractured her hip in a fall there on Jan. 4, entered the hospital that night, suffered a massive heart attack on Jan. 8 and died of heart failure, Mother Christophora said.         She was born Jan. 5, 1909, the youngest of the five children of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Romania, and was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.  Brother Becomes King         Her eldest brother became King Carol II of Romania, and at his behest she was married in her early 20's to Archduke Anton of the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and left Romania. She returned to her homeland in 1940 but was forced to leave in 1948 by the Communist Government.         She eventually came to the United States, carrying an heirloom diamond and sapphire tiara wrapped in a nightgown, and settled in Newton, Mass. She divorced the Archduke, who had served in the German Air Force during World War II, in 1954 and supported herself and her children by giving lectures on such topics as her life, Romania and world peace.         Her second marriage, to Dr. Stefan Issarescu, ended in divorce and then, with her children grown up, she became a nun of the Orthodox Church in the convent of the Protection of the Holy Virgin in Bussy-en-Othe in east-central France before going on to found the convent in Pennsylvania. After retiring as abbess at that convent, she continued an active life there and as a speaker on religious topics around the country.         She traveled to Romania in September, her first visit since 1948, to see the graves of her parents.  Author of Several Books         Her writings include a volume of memoirs, "I Live Again" (1952), and several books on spiritual and religious subjects including "Meditations on the Nicene Creed" (1958).         She is survived by three daughters from her first marriage, Alexandra, who lives in West Germany, and Magdalene and Elisabeth, who live in Austria; and two sons, Stefan, of Detroit, and Dominic, of Venice.         The former King Michael, who was ejected from Romania by the Communists shortly before Princess Ileana, now lives in Geneva.       
         Ruth Baldwin Folinsbee, a community leader and former government official in New Hope, Pa., died Wednesday at her home in New Hope. She was 100 years old and died in her sleep, said her daughter, Elizabeth Wiggins of New Hope.         Mrs. Folinsbee was involved in civic activities in her community and was a founder of the New Hope Public Health Association. In 1966, at the age of 75, she was elected to the Borough Council of New Hope and served until 1969.         Her husband, the landscape artist, John F. Folinsbee, died in 1972. In addition to her daughter, Elizabeth, she is survived by another daughter, Joan Cook of Princeton, N.J.; 7 grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Ford Schumann, a founder of a major philanthropic foundation in New Jersey and a generous contributor to health, education and community development causes, died on Friday at her winter home in Delray Beach, Fla. Mrs. Schumann, who also lived in Montclair, N.J., and Madison, Conn., was 99 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Robert, of Binghamton, N.Y.         Mrs. Schumann was the principal donor to the Florence and John Schumann Foundation, which she established with her husband, John J. Schumann Jr., a former president and chairman of the General Motors.         Mrs. Schumann also contributed to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair and Glen Ridge, N.J.         In addition to her son Robert, she is survived by another son, Ward F., of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a daughter, Caroline Mark of Wausau, Wis.; a sister, Harriet Dickenson of Binghamton, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren, and 7 great-grandchildren.       
         Mabel Pickford Jenkins, a retired psychiatric social worker in New York City, died on Thursday at the University Village Retirement Center in Tulsa, Okla. She was 98 years old and had lived in Tulsa since 1984.         Mrs. Jenkins, who lived in the New York City area for 60 years, died after a series of strokes, said Beatrice S. Hawkins of Manhattan, a friend.         In 1924 Mrs. Jenkins became the first director of the social service department of St. Phillip's Episcopal Church in Harlem. In 1935 she joined the Bureau of Child Guidance of the New York City Board of Education. In addition to coordinating services for mental-health clinics in the school system, she supervised the training of students from Columbia and Fordham Universities and from Smith College.         In 1962 she retired from the bureau and worked for two years in the children's psychiatric unit of the Jewish Guild for the Blind. Later she worked for the Community Service Society as a part-time counselor for the elderly. She retired for the second time in 1973.         She was born in Virginia City, Mont., and was an alumna of Columbia, Chicago and Howard Universities. She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work.         Mrs. Jenkins is survived by a nephew, Wilton Hines of Tulsa, and several nieces.       
         Mary C. O'Connor, a former chairwoman of Community Board 6 on the East Side of Manhattan, died on Sunday at Bellevue Hospital Center, where she was taken after she was hit by a truck at Second Avenue and 45th Street.         She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. O'Connor was a member of the community board for many years and its chairwoman in 1983 and 1984.         She was chief of civilian personnel at the Army Pictorial Center, in Long Island City, Queens. In 1970 she joined the Defense Supply Agency in Manhattan. She retired in 1975.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Sarah Jane Kinoy, a teacher and social worker who was an early leader in the education of children with cerebral palsy, died on Wednesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 96 years old and had lived in Manhattan and Tompkins Corners, N.Y.         She died of heart failure, said her son Ernest.         Mrs. Kinoy, a graduate of Teachers College, was a social worker with the American Red Cross during World War I and later taught at the Brooklyn Ethical Culture School and at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         She was a founder of the Brooklyn Community School in the early 1940's and was executive director of the New York Service for Orthopedic Handicapped. At Teachers College she coordinated the special education department for children with cerebral palsy and in the 1950's, in cooperation with the New York City Board of Education, she developed a pilot school for Manhattan children with the disease. She later served as director of services for Cerebral Palsy of Queens.         She is survived by two sons, Ernest, a television writer, of Williamsville, Vt., and Arthur of Montclair, N.J., a Rutgers University law professor; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Marjorie Hyde Bond, a fund-raising consultant, died on Sunday at the Community Hospital of Western Suffolk in Smithtown, L.I. She was 80 years old and lived in Peconic, L.I.         She died of Alzheimer's disease, her husband, Jules, said.         She began her career in 1958 with the Manhattan office of Robert College of Istanbul, and its affiliate, the American College for Girls, as director of fund raising. She remained in the post until the institutions were turned over to the Turkish Government in the 1970's.         Subsequently, she conducted several major fund-raising campaigns. One was for Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn. Another was for the New York Botanical Garden that culminated in the restoration of its conservatory, renamed the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory for its donor, and the establishment of endowments for its maintenance.         Her last fund-raising campaign in the late 1970's resulted in the acquisition of the Mashomack forest preserve on Shelter Island by the Nature Conservancy, a national environmental organization.         Mrs. Bond was born in Bradford, Pa., graduated from Skidmore College and did graduate work in child psychology at Yale.         Her husband survives her.       
         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Virginia R. Forrest, a volunteer who in 1961 became the first woman to win the Florida Governor's Award for Conservation, died Sunday at Pennswood Village in Newtown, Pa. She was 94 years old and also lived in Stuart, Fla.         Mrs. Forrest died of natural causes, a spokesman for the family said.         She participated in community affairs throughout her life. In 1972 she founded the Bucks County Conservation Alliance in New Hope, Pa., and she continued to serve as an adviser to the organization. She was a director of the Environmental Studies Center in Stuart, and a founder and director from 1966 to 1975 of the Martin County Conservation Alliance in Stuart.         Twice widowed, Mrs. Forrest is survived by a son and two daughters from her first marriage, Frederick B. Williamson 3d, Virginia Hutton and Beverly Magill, all of New Hope; eight grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild.       
         Alison Stilwell Cameron, a daughter of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell who became an artist, author and lecturer on China, died Thursday at the Community Hospital in Monterey, Calif. She was 70 years old and lived in Carmel, Calif.         Mrs. Cameron died of pneumonia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She is survived by her husband, Col. William R. Cameron; two daughters, Catherine, of Washington and Laurie Desimone, of Carmel; a son, Bruce, of Santa Maria, Calif.; two sisters, Nancy Easterbrook of Carmel and Winifred Cox of Tiberon, Calif.; a brother, Dr. Benjamin Stilwell of Guam, and two granddaughters.       
         Friedelind Wagner, a granddaughter of the composer Richard Wagner who won fame for her courageous opposition to Nazism, died early yesterday evening at the Community Hospital in Herdecke, Germany, in the Ruhr. She was 73 years old.         She died of liver disease, said her nephew, Gottfried Wagner.         Miss Wagner, who bore an uncanny resemblance to her grandfather, was born in Bayreuth, Germany, the site of the annual summer Wagner festival. She was educated in Germany and England and at the Sorbonne in Paris.         Her father, Siegfried, whom she adored, died in 1930, along with her grandmother Cosima, who was Franz Liszt's daughter. It was her English-born mother, Winifred, whose fanatic admiration for Adolf Hitler (and Hitler's equally fanatic admiration for Wagner's music) made Bayreuth into a Nazi shrine in the 1930's. Fled the Nazis         Friedelind Wagner, always a rebel, resisted that trend and finally fled Germany in 1940 amid a burst of publicity.         "I was always stubborn and independent," she said in an interview in 1944. "I only had to listen to Hitler rave and rant to be disgusted and horrified."         When war broke out in September 1940, she was visiting in Switzerland. Already an outspoken opponent of Nazism, she realized that the protection she had enjoyed as a member of the Wagner family would no longer guarantee her safety. Although offered asylum in Britain, she was interned by bureaucratic accident for three months. Toscanini's Intercession         Released at the intercession of the conductor Arturo Toscanini, another outspoken anti-Fascist, she came to the United States in 1942 after detours to Uruguay and Argentina. During the war she remained an active anti-Nazi propagandist, a particular embarassment for the Nazis, given their idolatry of Wagner.         Miss Wagner's career after 1945 was a checkered one. She wrote a lively autobiography, "Heritage of Fire," but her only real ally in the Wagner family was her brother Wieland. His brilliant career as a stage director and designer and co-director of the Bayreuth Festival was cut short by his death in 1966.         Until then Miss Wagner had directed the Bayreuth Festival Master Classes, a summerlong series of workshops and instruction for young singers, conductors, directors and critics. After Wieland's death, the hostility shown her by her mother and her brother Wolfgang turned her later years into a gypsylike odyssey as she fruitlessly attempted to find support for her dream of a theatrical academy.         She lived in northern England for a number of years, then attempted to relocate to Bayreuth and spent her final years in Lucerne.         She is survived by her brother Wolfgang, of Bayreuth, and a sister, Verena Lafferentz, of Uberlingen, Germany.       
         Goldie Bober Kweller, the president of Mercaz, the Zionist organization of the Conservative movement, died on Sunday at her home in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens. She was 70 years old.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Kweller, a native of Brooklyn, was national president of the Women's League for Conservative Judaism from 1978 to 1982. At her death, she was the chairwoman of the league's field service and of its long-range planning committee.         She was a member of the board of overseers of the Jewish Theological Seminary and the board of directors of the United Synagogue of America, vice president of the World Council of Synagogues and secretary of the national association of Solomon Schechter Day Schools.         In 1979 she received the community leadership award of the Jewish Theological Seminary and in 1986 she received the seminary's Solomon Schechter Medal for service in the field of Jewish education.         Mrs. Kweller is survived by her husband, Murry; two sons, Bruce, of Queens, and David, of Jackson, Miss.; a sister, Gert Mass Unger of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and six grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Murray, a lawyer who was active in community affairs in Rye, N.Y., died on Thursday at her home in Rye. She was 71 years old.         She died of heart failure, a funeral home representative said.         Mrs. Murray graduated from Columbia law School in 1943 and was associated with the law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn for about six years before leaving to raise a family. She later worked with Meals on Wheels and was chairwoman of the Board of Zoning Appeals in Rye.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a daughter, Kathleen Wheatman of Fremont, Calif; three sons, David, of Rye, Philip, of Yonkers, and William, of Farmingdale, L.I., and six grandchildren.       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Anita Hart Balter, an artist and writer well known for her role in fostering the arts in the Hudson Valley, died on June 29 at her home in Garrison, N.Y.         Mrs. Balter, who was 57 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., died of complications from breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Her activities were directed at both art and broader community development. She was the founder and operator of Gallery Forecast, now defunct, in Peekskill, in which well-known sculptors chose emerging talent for exhibition to draw the attention of the many corporate headquarters in the region.         Mrs. Balter, who was born in Amsterdam and moved to the United States with her family just before World War II, was also on the board of the Garrison Art Center, where she established a Scholarship and Mentor Program in which artists worked with promising local pupils. In 1987 she was a founding board member of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival.         She is survived by her husband, Lee; her mother, Jenny Hart; a brother, Herbert Hart of Monte Carlo, Monaco; and, by a former marriage, a daughter, Elise Hart of Berkeley, Calif., and two sons, Michael Sheffrin of Majorca, and Ivan Sheffrin of Washington, and a grandson.       
         Patricia Robbins Beatty, an award-winning author of 50 children's books, died on Tuesday at the Riverside (Calif.) Community Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in Riverside.         She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Beatty's books were generally admired for their evocation of both the humor and the harsh realities of the American West in the 19th century. Her more recent novels, including "Charley Skedaddle" (1987), which won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, dealt with the Civil War.         She was born in Portland, Ore., and spent much of her childhood in the Northwest, sometimes living on Indian reservations. She graduated from Reed College in Portland and became a children's librarian and a high school teacher of English and history.         She began to write when her children were small and drew on her knowledge of the Quileute Indians for her first book, "The Indian Canoe Maker," published in 1960 by Caxton Press. Eleven books that followed were written in collaboration with her first husband, Dr. John L. Beatty, a professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, who died in 1975.         In 1974, she received an award for a distinguished body of work from the Southern California Council on Children's Literature. In 1988, she established the John and Patricia Beatty Award through the California Library Association to encourage the writing of children's books about the culture and heritage of California.         A forthcoming book, "Jayhawker," the story of a young abolitionist during the Civil War, is to be published by Morrow Junior Books in October.         She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Carl Uhr, a professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside; a daughter, Alexandra Beatty, and two grandchildren.       
         Alline Elizabeth Davis, a past director of the Gramercy Park Neighborhood Association who was active in community affairs, died on June 18 at her son's home in Vista, Calif. She was 83 years old and until recently lived in the Gramercy Park section of Manhattan.         Mrs. Davis died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a spokeswoman for the family said.         In 1987 she founded and was director of a program, known as Help Our Neighbors Eat Year-Round, to collect cans of food at supermarkets in the Gramercy Park area for distribution to the needy elderly. In 1981 she founded the 22d Steet Association.         Her husband, Hermon Davis, a musician, died in 1965.         In addition to her son, Del, Mrs. Davis is survived by a daughter, Mona Shorey of Sutter Creek, Calif.; a brother, Edward Ponder of Chicago; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Marguerite Feinstein, founder and director of the retiree division of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 23,000 municipal workers in New York City, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 57 years old and lived in Clinton Corners, N.Y.         Mrs. Feinstein, who was known as Maggie, was the wife of Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said Frank Mazza, a spokesman for the union.         Under the Local 237 retiree program, which Mrs. Feinstein founded in 1980, more than 5,000 members participate in classes, community projects and political activities as well as the customary social activities, trips and health-care seminars offered by labor unions. The program has become a model for teamster locals across the country and for locals of other unions.         Mrs. Feinstein was born in Milton, N.Y., and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Marist College. Before joining Local 237, she was director of legislation and political education for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in New York State.         Mrs. Feinstein's older son by a previous marriage, John Dakin, who lived in Poughkeepsie, died of a heart attack on July 23. In addition to Mr. Feinstein, she is survived by her younger son, Patrick Dakin of Poughkeepsie; a daughter, Colleen Trogisch of Pleasant Valley, N.Y.; and two granddaughters.       
         Sylvia Petit Maples, the director of community services at the National Association of Drug Abuse Problems in New York, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.         She was 45 years old and died of liver cancer, according to a statement from the association.         Ms. Maples was the co-founder and former chairwoman of the Association of Vocational Rehabilitation Advocates for Substance Abusers, the first organization formed exclusively to help with jobs for recovering drug abusers.         Ms. Maples earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the City College of New York.         She is survived by her mother, Mary Petit of Pawling, N.Y.; four sisters, Cordella Pascariello of Freeport, L.I., Cassandra DeFillippo of Pawling, Renee Glover of New Rochelle, and Sarita Petit of the Bronx, and a brother, Peter Petit of San Francisco.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Aline MacMahon, an actress whose stage, screen, radio and television career lasted more than 50 years, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She apparently died from pneumonia, friends said.         A veteran of 43 films, Miss MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in "Dragon Seed" in 1944, appearing as the Chinese mother to the part played by Katharine Hepburn.         A Warner Brothers casting director in 1933 placed Miss MacMahon among the 10 smartest actresses, in a class with Miss Hepburn and Helen Hayes. Miss MacMahon's beauty inspired Cecil Beaton to photograph her and Isamu Noguchi to sculpture a marble bust. 'Beauty and Vitality and Truth'         Raves acclaimed her early role in Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," in 1926. Alexander Woollcott, the critic, said she acted "with extraordinary beauty and vitality and truth." The New Yorker said she "tempted one to rank her immediately as among the Olympians." Noel Coward called the newcomer "astonishing, moving and beautiful."         Rarely did she get a bad notice, even in productions that were otherwise panned. Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times in 1967: "I have been seeing Aline MacMahon for more years than I'm going to be honest enough or ungentlemanly enough to count. Always she has pleased me, sometimes more, sometimes less, nevertheless always."         Offstage, she was equally busy. As chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater in 1950, she organized productions for community theaters. She was active in relief charities.         Miss MacMahon was born in McKeesport, Pa., and moved to Brooklyn with her family. Her father, the late William Marcus MacMahon, was the editor of Munsey's Magazine. At her urging, her mother, Jennie Simon MacMahon, began her own stage career at the age of 53. She died in 1984, three weeks before her 107th birthday.         Miss MacMahon graduated from Barnard College in 1920 and made her Broadway debut the next year in "The Mirage." Among her more memorable plays were "Pictures in the Hallway," "Once in a Lifetime," "The Eve of Saint Mark," "The Confidential Clerk" and "All the Way Home."         Her films included "Ah, Wilderness!," with Lionel Barrymore; "Gold Diggers of 1933"; "The Search," with Montgomery Clift; "The Eddie Cantor Story"; "The Lady Is Willing," with Marlene Dietrich; "The World Changes," with Paul Muni; "Five Star Final," with Edward G. Robinson; "One Way Passage," with William Powell; "Flame and Arrow," with Burt Lancaster; "I Live My Life," with Joan Crawford, and "Babbitt."         Her final role, in 1975 with Meryl Streep, was in "Trelawny of the Wells," the same play Ms. MacMahon performed at Barnard 55 years earlier.         She was married to Clarence S. Stein, the architect who helped to design Sunnyside Gardens in Queens and to plan Radburn, N.J. There are no survivors.       
         Veronica Perry, a Harlem teacher and the mother of Edmund Perry, the honor student fatally shot by a police officer on Morningside Drive on June 12, 1985, died on Oct. 4 at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 44 years old.         She died as a result of a heart condition, the funeral home said.         Mrs. Perry, a fifth-generation Harlem resident and a graduate of Bronx Community College and Fordham University, was a teacher for the Lenox Hill Association. She was a past president of Community School Board 3 and of the Parent-Teacher Association of Wadleigh Junior High School and was a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club.         She is survived by her husband, Jonah Perry Sr.; her mother, Eva Rutledge; a son, Jonah Jr.; a daughter, Nicol, and several brothers and sisters.       
         Aline Laveen MacMahon, an actress whose career on the stage, screen, radio and television lasted more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.

         Edith Zornow, a prominent figure in the New York independent film and video community who produced the animation for "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company" on public television, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72 years old.         She died of cancer, said Ellen Morgenstern, a spokeswoman for the Children's Television Workshop, the producer of "Sesame Street."         Ms. Zornow, who was born in Brooklyn, was a producer at the New York public-television station WNDT-TV through the 1960's. There she produced "The Art of Film," a series with the critic Stanley Kauffman as host, for which Ms. Zornow won an Emmy Award in 1964.         She joined the Children's Television Workshop in 1970, during the first season of "Sesame Street," and "helped to define the look of the show, which relies heavily on animation," Ms. Morgenstern said. Among the many prominent independent film makers with whom Ms. Zornow worked were John Hubley and Claudia Weill.  Honoring a Program         In 1979, the Whitney Museum of American Art offered a compilation of "Sesame Street" animation and films commissioned by Ms. Zornow, and the Museum of Modern Art offered a similar program in 1989 to honor the 20th anniversary of "Sesame Street."         In the 1970's, Ms. Zornow was the artistic director of Movies for Kids, a series of programs at Lincoln Center. She also set up and oversaw the film division at Grove Press, and supervised the theatrical release of such ground-breaking films as "Finnegans Wake," "Titticut Follies" and "I Am Curious (Yellow)."         She is survived by a brother, Jack Zornow, of Queens, and two nephews, David Zornow and Todd Zornow, of Manhattan.       
         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
