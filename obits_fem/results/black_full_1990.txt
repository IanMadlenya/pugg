        Anna Arnold Hedgeman, an educator, civil rights advocate and the first black woman to be a member of a mayoral cabinet in New York City, died Jan. 17 in Harlem Hospital. She was 90 years old and had lived in Harlem for many years.         Anna Arnold Hedgeman, an educator, civil rights advocate and the first black woman to be a member of a mayoral cabinet in New York City, died Jan. 17 in Harlem Hospital. She was 90 years old and had lived in Harlem for many years.         Mrs. Hedgeman was an assistant to Mayor Robert F. Wagner from 1954 to 1958. Earlier she had been executive director of the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission and assistant to Oscar R. Ewing, Administrator of the Federal Security Agency, now part of the Department of Health and Human Services.         As an executive of the Young Women's Christian Association for 12 years, she helped to develop a variety of international programs in education.         In 1963 Mrs. Hedgeman joined the staff of the Commission on Religion and Race of the National Council of Churches. The commission was intended to mobilize the resources of Protestant and Orthodox churches to work against racial injustice in American life. Mrs. Hedgeman retired at the end of 1967.         Ran for Council President         Before joining the commission, Mrs. Hedgeman was a consultant to the American Missionary Association of the United Church of Christ.         A Democrat, she ran for Congress in 1960 as an insurgent from the East Bronx and lost. In 1965 she was an unsuccessful candidate for City Council President on the Reform Democratic ticket with Representative William Fitz Ryan.         In 1953, at the request of Chester Bowles, the United States Ambassador to India, Mrs. Hedgeman spent three months in India as an exchange leader for the State Department. She was also the keynote speaker at the first Conference of the Women of Africa and African Descent at Accra, Ghana, in 1960.         Mrs. Hedgeman was honored for her work in race relations by, among others, the National Urban League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, the National Council of Negro Women and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. In 1983 she received a ''pioneer woman'' award from the New York State Conference on Midlife and Older Women.         She was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, grew up in Anoka, Minn., and graduated from Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn. After graduation, she moved to Holly Springs, Miss., to teach at Rust College. She moved north and, after she married, settled in Brooklyn.         She was the author of ''The Trumpet Sounds'' (Holt, Rinehart & Company, 1964) and ''The Gift of Chaos'' (Oxford University Press, 1977).         She was married for 54 years to the late Merritt A. Hedgeman, an interpreter of black folk music and opera.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  February 8, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Jan. 26 about Anna Arnold Hedgeman, a civil rights advocate and former mayoral aide, misidentified the New York City mayoral candidate on whose ticket she ran in 1965. He was Representative William Fitts Ryan.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Edna Ramsaier Yardley, the widow and collaborator of Herbert O. Yardley, a pioneer code breaker, died of a stroke on Tuesday at her home. She was 87 years old.         Edna Ramsaier Yardley, the widow and collaborator of Herbert O. Yardley, a pioneer code breaker, died of a stroke on Tuesday at her home. She was 87 years old.         She was Mr. Yardley's assistant in the American Black Chamber operation that he established in 1919 in New York City. In 1921 that group broke the Japanese diplomatic code, enabling the United States to know Japanese negotiating positions in the 1922 naval disarmament conference in Washington.         She remained in New York after the chamber was abolished by Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson in 1929 with the oft-quoted aphorism, ''Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.''         In 1940, she joined the Army's Signal Intelligence Service, the organization that again broke Japanese diplomatic codes.         In 1941 she left the Army to rejoin Mr. Yardley in establishing a Canadian coding service. The two were married in 1944.         A first marriage had ended in divorce. Mr. Yardley, considered the father of American crytography, died in 1958. Mrs. Yardley is survived by a sister, Lillian R. Meyer of Whiting, N.J.       
        Sister Thea Bowman, a nationally active black educator who with song, prayer and persistent exhortation urged the Roman Catholic Church to embrace the culture of African Americans, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Canton, Miss. She was 52 years old.         Sister Thea Bowman, a nationally active black educator who with song, prayer and persistent exhortation urged the Roman Catholic Church to embrace the culture of African Americans, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Canton, Miss. She was 52 years old.         Eight months ago, at a semiannual meeting of the nation's Catholic bishops in South Orange, N.J., Sister Thea, suffering from breast and bone cancer, brought the assembly to its feet with an address depicting the black experience in America. She then asked the prelates to cross arms, clasp hands and sing ''We Shall Overcome.''         ''You've got to move together to do that,'' she told them.         But the work of Sister Thea, a Canton native who was the granddaughter of a slave, was far more than symbolic.         She was director of the Office of Intercultural Affairs for the Diocese of Jackson, Miss., and served on the faculty of the Institute of Black Catholic Studies at Xavier University in New Orleans. Last year, Mary Lou Jennings of Stowe, Vt., and the Rev. Thomas F. X. Hoar of Winooski, Vt., established the Sister Thea Bowman Black Catholic Educational Foundation to provide financial support for black students at all educational levels.         ''She was an outstanding woman,'' said Bishop Joseph Houck of the Diocese of Jackson. ''She was proud of her heritage and totally dedicated to the vision of Jesus Christ for love and growth of all people.''         Sister Thea was to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious award given to American Catholics, at the University of Notre Dame's commencement exercises on May 20. The award will be posthumously presented, the university said Friday.         Working and Praying Together         Much of the work of Sister Thea, the only black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, was done through music.         ''When I came into the Catholic Church in the 1940's,'' she said in an interview in 1987, ''we had to leave behind us the music that was an expression of the spirituality of our home, community and upbringing. People were teaching us uniformity.''         The uniformity began to break down in the early 1960's, she said, when the Second Vatican Council encouraged expressions of ethnic heritage. She recorded an album of 15 spirituals, ''Sister Thea: Songs of My People,'' in 1988.         ''There's a black church that transcends denominations,'' Sister Thea said in the 1987 interview. ''If we work together, play together, stand together, pray together, then we can create a new heaven.''         She is survived by three cousins, Barbara Barber, Anita Scott and Johnie Middleton, all of Jackson.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''         The Legend of Gosta Berling         1924         The Street of Sorrow         1925         Flesh and the Devil         1927         Love         1927         A Woman of Affairs         1929         Anna Christie         1930         Susan Lenox, Her Fall and Rise         1931         Mata Hari         1931         Grand Hotel         1932         As You Desire Me         1932         Queen Christina         1933         The Painted Veil         1934         Anna Karenina         1935         Camille         1936         Conquest         1937         Ninotchka         1939         Two Faced Woman         1942       
        Verda Freeman Welcome, who was the first black woman to become a state senator in Maryland, died in a Baltimore hospital on Sunday after a series of strokes. She was 83 years old.         Verda Freeman Welcome, who was the first black woman to become a state senator in Maryland, died in a Baltimore hospital on Sunday after a series of strokes. She was 83 years old.         Mrs. Welcome, who had a bachelor's degree from Morgan State College and a master's from New York University, had been a teacher in the Baltimore public schools for 11 years when she decided to enter politics. A Democrat, she was elected to the House of Delegates in 1958 and to the Maryland Senate in 1962. She served until 1982, whenshe retired.         In 1963 Mrs. Welcome survived an assassination attempt. She was shot as she got out of her car in front of her home. Two men were convicted in the incident.         She was the major sponsor of a bill barring discrimination in public accommodations, and helped to repeal Maryland's miscegenation ban.         She was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1968, 1972 and 1976.         Mrs. Welcome's husband, Dr. Henry Welcome, died in 1979. Her survivors include a daughter, eight sisters, four brothers and a grandson.       
        Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Since Mrs. Hyde was found to have cancer five years ago, she worked ardently to call attention to the disease, raising nearly $2 million for Georgetown University Medical Center, which established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research last year.         In March she organized a benefit at the new Chanel boutique at the Willard Hotel in Washington for which 350 people paid $350 a ticket. The evening raised more than $50,000 for the Nina Hyde Center and an equal amount for Look Good . . . Feel Better, a separate counseling program that helps women after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.         As a reporter, Mrs. Hyde was known for covering fashion as intently as if she were covering a war, searching for the sociological significance of such trends as the development of the punk style in London.         Style of Protest Movement         Her article on that phenomenon helped draw attention at the end of the 1970's to the protest movement among the young. It also helped alert retailers to the London street scene.         She traveled through Europe and the Far East for exhaustive studies of the history of silk and of wool, with her analysis appearing in National Geographic. She was also noted for her ''Ins and Outs'' column on New Year's Day, which covered political and social trends as well as fashion.         She also conducted a lecture series at the Smithsonian Institution, with guests like the designers Issey Miyake, Norma Kamali and Sonia Rykiel.         But she was not averse to offering mundane, sensible advice to women on how to dress. Short skirts look younger than long ones, she believed. Classic shapes are good investments, she said. She advised her readers to buy clothes on sale and at discount. She herself usually wore black dresses and very little makeup.         The daughter of Dr. Harry A. Solomon, an internist, and his wife, Ruth, she was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College. One of two women accepted at the time for New York University's Law School, she dropped out to work for McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, and the Maidenform Brassiere Company. Later she joined Women's Wear Daily as the corset and brassiere editor. In 1961, after marrying Lloyd Hyde, a real estate developer, she moved to Washington where she wrote a column, ''Hyde & Chic,'' for The Washington Daily News. After that newspaper's demise she joined The Washington Post, in 1972.         Celebrities Honor Writer         In 1986, when the Fashion Group decided to honor her at a formal dinner raising money for the group's' scholarship fund, she insisted that some proceeds go toward AIDS research. More than 800 people paid $150 to attend, including fashion designers like Bill Blass, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren from New York, Carla Fendi and Rosita Missoni from Italy and Jacqueline de Ribes and Thierry Mugler from Paris.         Fashion designers have been major contributors to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Mr. Lauren was host at a cocktail party two years ago and donated $100,000 to get the fund started. Other supporters include Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix and Yves Saint Laurent and the Chanel company.         Mrs. Hyde received the Eugenia Sheppard Award for outstanding fashion reporting by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1988 and she was made a Chevalier des Artes et Lettres in Paris last October.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Washington, and Andrea, of San Francisco; her mother, Ruth Solomon of New York; a brother, Howard Solomon of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Marquise Sue de Brantes, of St. Armand Lepypre, France.         The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. Monday at the Washington Hebrew Congregation at Macomb Street and Massachusetts Avenue.       
        Ina Balin, a film and stage actress whose adoption of three Vietnamese orphans was dramatized in a 1980 television movie in which she played herself, died yesterday at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 52 years old and lived in Westport, Conn.         Ina Balin, a film and stage actress whose adoption of three Vietnamese orphans was dramatized in a 1980 television movie in which she played herself, died yesterday at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 52 years old and lived in Westport, Conn.         A spokesman for the hospital said Ms. Balin died of complications of chronic lung disease.         Ms. Balin became associated with a Saigon orphanage, An Lac, in 1970, when she visited it while touring with a U.S.O. show.         Five years later, in the final days of the Vietnam War, she and an another American, Betty Tisdale, helped evacuate children from the orphanage to the United States, and Ms. Balin, who was unmarried, adopted three girls. Two were infants; the other was a 16-year-old who was hidden aboard an evacuation plane, the actress said, because she was half black and so faced a dismal future in South Vietnam.         ''Adopting those children was the best thing I've ever done in my whole life,'' the Brooklyn-born actress told an interviewer shortly before her story was told on CBS in ''The Children of An Lac.'' ''It gives you a whole other perspective on life. It gets you involved with someone other than yourself, because children truly need you.''         Praised in Broadway Debut         Ms. Balin won critical praise for her Broadway debut in 1957 in ''Compulsion''; Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times said her portrayal of a convict's friend was ''tenderly moving.'' In 1959, she appeared in ''A Majority of One'' as the daughter of a housewife played by Gertrude Berg.         That year Ms. Balin also made her screen debut as Anthony Quinn's daughter in ''The Black Orchid.'' Her other films included ''From the Terrace'' (1960), ''The Young Doctors'' (1961), ''The Comancheros'' (1961), ''The Patsy'' (1964), ''The Greatest Story Every Told'' (1965), ''Charro!'' (1969) and ''The Projectionist'' (1971).         Ms. Balin, who traveled widely, was also a published photographer and was the co-owner of the Balin-Traube Art Gallery in New York, which operated on East 74th Street for three years in the early 1960's.         She is survived by her father, Sam Rosenberg of Hallandale, Fla; her daughters, Ba-Nhi Mai and Kim Thuy, both of Westport, and Nguyet Baty of Berlin; a brother, Richard Balin of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.         A memorial service is scheduled for tomorrow at 11 A.M. at the Spear Funeral Home, 39 South Benson Road, Fairfield, Conn.       
        Barbara Baxley, a stage, film and television actress, was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment. The medical examiner's office said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. She was 63 years old.         Barbara Baxley, a stage, film and television actress, was found dead Thursday in her Upper West Side apartment. The medical examiner's office said the apparent cause of death was a heart attack. She was 63 years old.         Since her 1948 Broadway debut as a baffled bride in a revival of Noel Coward's ''Private Lives,'' starring Tallulah Bankhead and Donald Cook, Miss Baxley played a wide variety of roles in productions that ranged from Shakespeare to musical comedies.         In 1960 she played a different bride, this one from Texas, in the Tennessee Williams play ''Period of Adjustment,'' for which she received a Tony nomination.         She also won critical praise as Sally Field's mother in the 1979 film ''Norma Rae'' and again in 1981 as a business executive in Wendy Wasserstein's play ''Isn't It Romantic.'' In his review of ''Isn't It Romantic,'' Mel Gussow of The New York Times cited Miss Baxley's ''stylish personification of boardroom urbanity.''         Other Broadway Credits         Miss Baxley's other Broadway credits include ''Whodunnit'' (1983), ''The Three Sisters'' (1964), ''She Loves Me'' (1963), ''The Flowering Peach'' (1954), ''The Frogs of Spring'' (1953), ''Camino Real'' (1953) and ''Out West of Eighth'' (1951).         Early in her career, she filled in for Jean Arthur in ''Peter Pan'' and took over Julie Harris's role in ''I Am a Camera.''         Off Broadway, she sang Brecht-Weill songs in ''Brecht on Brecht'' (1962) and appeared in ''To Be Young, Gifted and Black'' (1969).         She played Isabel in ''Measure for Measure,'' a New York Shakespeare Festival production in Central Park in 1966, and Portia in ''The Merchant of Venice'' at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., in 1967. At the Yale Repertory Theater she had the title roles in ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' and ''Major Barbara.''         She starred in the national companies of ''Zorba,'' ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs'' and the Kennedy Center Bicentennial production of ''Scarecrow.'' In Chicago she co-starred with George Grizzard in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and Moliere's ''Misanthrope.''         Miss Baxley's films included ''Nashville'' (1975), ''Countdown'' (1968), ''No Way to Treat a Lady'' (1968), ''All Fall Down'' (1962) and ''The Savage Eye'' (1960).         As Television Guest         Her many guest appearances on television included ''Murder, She Wrote,'' ''Hawaii Five-O,'' ''The Hitchcock Hour,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90.'' In the Norman Lear series ''All That Glitters,'' she played the industrialist L. W. Carruthers.         Miss Baxley, born in Stockton, Calif., graduated with honors in speech and history from the College of the Pacific in Stockton and won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, where she studied with Sanford Meisner. She was also a charter member of the Actors Studio, where she studied with Elia Kazan.         Miss Baxley received honors including the Actors Studio Award for achievement in 1980.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
        Jewel Hairston Bell, director of Tufts University's African-American Center, died last Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 58 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         Jewel Hairston Bell, director of Tufts University's African-American Center, died last Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. She was 58 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         Mrs. Bell died of breast cancer, said her husband, Derrick.         Mrs. Bell was born in Pittburgh and graduated from the Carnegie Insitute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University. She also studied psychiatric social work at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.         She was a social worker and education specialist with the Bureau of Equal Opportunity of the Massachusett Department of Education from 1977 to 1980. She later headed the Council on Minority Education at the University of Oregon for three years before returning to Massachusetts, where she was named head of the Tufts center in 1988.         Mrs. Bell's husband, a professor at Harvard Law School, has been on an unpaid leave of absence since April and says he will remain so in protest until Harvard appoints a black woman to its tenured law faculty.         Mrs. Bell is also survived by three sons, Derrick 3rd, Douglass, and Carter, all of Cambridge, and a sister, Jessica Shufford, of Fort Washington, Md.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.

        Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Delphine Seyrig, an actress and feminist whose celebrity stemmed from her first film performance, in ''Last Year at Marienbad'' in 1961, died on Monday in Paris. She was 58 years old.         Miss Seyrig died in a hospital after a long illness, The Associated Press reported.         After her debut in ''Marienbad,'' directed by Alain Resnais, Miss Seyrig appeared in more than 30 films for many of Europe's foremost directors. Among her credits are Joseph Losey's ''Accident'' (1967), Francois Truffaut's ''Stolen Kisses'' (1968) and Luis Bunuel's ''Milky Way'' (1969) and ''Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' (1972).         She also acted in ''The Day of the Jackal'' (1973), ''A Doll's House'' (1973), ''The Black Windmill'' (1974) and ''I Sent a Letter to My Love'' (1981).         By the mid-1970's, Miss Seyrig had become an active feminist.         ''The theater and films,'' she said at the time, ''are very far from women's consciousness about themselves.''         Seeking to correct that situation, she began working with female directors. In 1975, she starred in ''India Song,'' written and directed by Marguerite Duras. In 1976, she made ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' directed by Chantal Akerman.         Miss Seyrig, who began her acting career in the theater, performed on the European stage in ''The Lover'' by Harold Pinter; in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ''Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant,'' and in Beckett's ''Play.'' She appeared on Broadway in 1972 in ''The Little Black Book.''         Miss Seyrig's marriage to the artist Jack Youngerman ended in divorce. She is survived by a son.
