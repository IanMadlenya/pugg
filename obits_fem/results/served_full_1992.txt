She was 98 years old and lived much of her life in Long Island City and Richmond Hill, Queens.         She died of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Sarcka and her husband, Wayne, established Spring Lake Ranch at Cuttingsville, Vt., in 1932 for people with mental and emotional problems and ran it for 30 years. Their therapeutic approach, based on the participation of both staff members and residents in ranch affairs, attracted national attention.         Retiring to the island of Jamaica in 1961, the Sarckas organized a school for adults in the mountain community of Malvern. After her husband's death in 1969, Mrs. Sarcka returned to Queens.

For more than 40 years Dr. Smithson traveled each summer to work on the excavations of the ancient agora, or marketplace, in Athens that were supervised by the American School of Classical Studies there.         The Greek period that she studied, from 1200 to 900 B.C., is challenging because of its lack of a literary record. She focused on pottery and its decorations for insights into the culture.         Dr. Smithson was born in Indiana.  She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1944, a master's degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1946 and a doctorate in classical archeology and Greek from Bryn Mawr in 1956.

         Elinor White Montgomery, until recently the board chairwoman of the New York City School Volunteer Program, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Montgomery's volunteer work also included her serving as a trustee of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and the Thacher School in Ojai, Calif.

         Cecile Ruth Sands, who served for six years as the only woman on New York City's Board of Education and also worked for charitable causes, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old.         She died of a heart attack, her family said.         After her surprise appointment in 1955 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Mrs. Sands immediately became a pivotal member of the board and took controversial stands against McCarthyism and for integration.         In her first year on the board she was the sole dissenter against a measure to force school workers to inform on employees who had been Communists. Her view was vindicated when four teachers, who renounced the party but refused to inform on others, appealed to the State Education Commissioner. He overruled the board, saying, "This type of inquisition has no place in the school system."         In a 1957 talk to the Central Synagogue in Manhattan, she called for school integration to overcome the effects of racial separation in neighborhood housing patterns.         For 60 years she was on the board of the Hebrew Education Society, which ran a settlement house in Brooklyn, and was its first female president. She was an officer in the National Council of Jewish Women and the National Jewish Welfare Board.         Her husband of 36 years, Dr. Irving J. Sands, a neurologist and psychiatrist, is deceased. She is survived by two sons, Dr. William L. of Albany, N.Y., and Dr. Richard H. of Westport, Conn.; seven grandchildren; five great grandchildren, and a brother, Dr. Eugene A. Humbert of Atlantis, Fla.       
         Anita Colby, perhaps the nation's first "supermodel" and known as "The Face" after her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine, died yesterday at her home in Oyster Bay, L.I. She was 77 years old.         Miss Colby died of lung disease, her sister, Francine Okie of East Greenwich, R.I., said.         Although her career was launched and revolved around her widely acclaimed beauty, Miss Colby became an author, a newspaper columnist, an advertising executive, chief assistant to Hollywood moguls and a host on the "Today" show -- as well as a model and film actress.         Born Anita Counihan in Washington, on Aug. 5, 1914, Miss Colby was the eldest daughter of Bud Counihan, a cartoonist for the New York Evening World and the artist for the Betty Boop series. A Stunning $100 an Hour         At the age of 19, Ms. Colby moved to New York and soon became the nation's most famous and highest-paid model, working for the John Powers agency. With her willowy, ash-blonde beauty, she was the first model ever to receive $100 an hour -- a stunning figure in those days -- and she once appeared on the covers of 15 magazines in a single month, including Time.         "She was the first great model," Miss Colby's longtime friend, Frances Koltun, said yesterday. "She was an extraordinarly stylish woman, and I hate to use that word because it sounds superficial, but she had exquisite taste."         Realizing that she had chosen a short-lived career, Miss Colby moved to Hollywood after only one year as a model and, while on contract with R.K.O., appeared in nine movies, including "Mary Queen of Scots" and "Brute Force." A New Career         But her reviews were hardly raves, and Miss Colby returned to New York in the early 1940's to take a position selling advertising for Harper's Bazaar. A column about her in The Herald Tribune on Jan. 4, 1950, written by Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg, said, "Her contract called for a salary of $55 a week, plus -- and that proved to be a big plus -- 10 percent of all the advertising she brought into the magazine." Miss Colby's sister, Francine, said yesterday, "She sold more advertising than all of them."         To her friends, according to the Herald Tribune column, she said: " 'If I ever go to Hollywood again, I'll tell those stars what to do.' And she did."         In 1944, Miss Colby was hired by David O. Selznick as his studio's "feminine director." Ms. Falkenburg, who became a close friend of Miss Colby, said yesterday: "She was in charge of coordinating all of these stars of the Selznick stable, on screen and off. She decided how they should be photographed, how they would dress, how public they should become, what interviews they should do. She was the den mother for the top beauties in America." Turned Down Clark Gable         And in the process, Miss Colby became friends with Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, Shirley Temple, Joan Fontaine, Katharine Hepburn and others. She also turned down marriage proposals from Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart, but let them down easy. "I introduced them to their wives," she told a reporter in 1970 on the occasion of her first and only marriage, to Palen Flagler, a business executive. Mr. Flagler died in 1980.         In 1947, after working for the Selznick organization, Miss Colby served as a $150,000-a-year executive assistant to the head of Paramount Pictures. She later started a public relations company in New York, wrote "Anita Colby's Beauty Book," bought and sold the Women's News Service, for which she wrote a syndicated newspaper column called "Anita Says," and appeared for six months on the "Today" show with Dave Garroway. There he hired Barbara Walters to write her scripts.         Miss Colby is survived by her sister.       
         Margaret R. Weiss, an author and photography editor, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, said her cousin, Michael M. Engel.         Miss Weiss was the author of "Ben Shahn: Photographer," a 1973 study of the photographic work of the American painter. She also wrote four other books on photography.         A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Barnard College, Miss Weiss worked as the associate editor of the American Mercury magazine before becoming photography editor of the Saturday Review of Literature in 1960. She remained at the magazine until 1979.         In the 1960's, Miss Weiss worked on an important series of exhibitions entitled "Photography in the Fine Arts," organized by the photographer Ivan Dmitri and sponsored by the Saturday Review. She also served as an exhibition consultant for the Hallmark Corporation, the Eastman Kodak Corporation and other organizations.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Dr. Rosa Lee Nemir Audi, a pulmonary and pediatrics specialist who worked 60 years as a doctor, teacher and researcher, died on Monday at Tisch Hospital at New York University in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Dr. Nemir, who used her maiden name professionally, died of lung fibrosis, her family said.         Among the first American women to become a full professor of pediatrics, Dr. Nemir promoted medical careers for women as president of the American Medical Women's Association, North American vice president of Medical Women's International and its representative to the United Nations.         Tuberculosis was a major focus of her work. Before the discovery of antibiotics to treat the disease, Dr. Nemir studied the effects of steroids in tuberculosis patients. She also was the first to use rifampin, which became a standard drug for TB, to treat children and followed one group of patients from childhood through the next 30 years.         Her entire career was at New York University's medical school and Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remained active until her recent illness. She had served as director of the Bellevue Children's Chest Clinic, medical director for the Adolescent Girls Clinic at the Judson Health Center and director of Pediatric Laboratories at Gouverneur Hospital.         She was also an officer of the Young Men's Christian Association, Brooklyn chapter manager for the American Red Cross and a member of the boards of the Irvington House for Children, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society and the Willoughby House Settlement.         Born in Waco, Tex., she graduated from the University of Texas in 1926 and Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1930.         Her husband of 35 years, E. J. Audi, who ran a furniture and carpet business, died in 1968.         She is survived by two sons, Alfred, of Syracuse, and Robert, of Lincoln, Neb.; a daughter, Elaine Audi Macken of Brooklyn; a sister, Aline Nemir Speer of Austin, Tex., and eight grandchildren.       
         Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.         She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said.         Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.

Mrs. Reynal is survived by a brother, Robert W. Whelan of Washington Depot, Conn.; her sister, Eleanor W. Ewart of Manhattan, and eight nieces and nephews.       
         Dr. Alexandra Symonds, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who was deeply involved in broadening the consideration of women's issues in her field, died on May 20 at her home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. She was 73 years old.         Dr. Symonds died of pancreatic cancer, said Lily Harmon, her sister-in-law.

         Lydia Joel, the former editor in chief of Dance Magazine and head of the dance department at the School of Performing Arts, died on Sunday at New York Hospital She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, said her husband, Edwin Miller.         As teacher and journalist, Miss Joel helped to increase appreciation of dance as an art and to raise standards of dance writing and training. Appointed editor in chief of Dance Magazine in 1952, she began to emphasize serious criticism, essays, photographic features and foreign reports. As a result, a publication that had previously been read largely by performers and teachers came to appeal to the general dance audience.         Through her early teaching activities in Texas, she acknowledged the importance of fostering dance across America. And at the School of Performing Arts in New York, she supervised a program that prepared young people for professional careers.  Studied Two Methods         Miss Joel, whose maiden name was Tarnower, was born in New York City. She received a bachelor's degree in English from New York University and did additional graduate work at Cornell University. She studied ballet at the School of American Ballet and modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and Hanya Holm, two leaders of the German modern dance that flourished before World War II. She also attended summer sessions of the Bennington (Vt.) School of Dance, the forerunner of today's American Dance Festival.         At Bennington in 1937, Miss Joel danced in the premiere of "Trend," Miss Holm's monumentally scaled depiction of social conflicts. In New York that same year, Miss Joel appeared in Max Reinhardt's production of "The Eternal Road."         She taught in 1938 at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and from 1938 to 1944 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she headed her own company.         Her first husband was the conductor Gerhard Joel; he died in 1946 but she retained Joel as her professional name. She married Mr. Miller, the entertainment editor of Seventeen magazine, in 1953.         Miss Joel joined the staff of Dance Magazine in 1947, working in the editorial and advertising departments. When she left the publication in 1969, the staff, under her guidance, had grown from 4 to 15 people.         Miss Joel directed the dance department of the School of Performing Arts from 1973 until her retirement in 1984, producing the high school's annual concerts and arranging a performance by 12 of its students at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982.         She served on the board of directors of the American College Dance Festival, the Association of American Dance Companies and the National Association for Regional Ballet, and contributed articles to Vogue, Parents Magazine and other publications. In recent years, she lectured and wrote about Catherine de' Medici, the Renaissance monarch who influenced the development of ballet in European courts.         In addition to her husband, Miss Joel is survived by a son, Eric Miller of Manhattan, and three brothers, Irving Tarnower of Teaneck, N.J., Dr. William Tarnower of Topeka, Kans., and Gerald Tarnower of Dallas.

         Joyce Macwatty Black, called "the ultimate volunteer" for her nearly 40 years as an officer of more than 75 charitable organizations and government panels, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 65 years old, and her primary residence was in Manhattan.         She died of metastasized breast cancer, her family said.         As a leader in many causes, Mrs. Black became an expert on volunteerism and served as a consultant and coordinator of volunteer activities at local, state and Federal levels.         Last year, President Bush appointed her to the National Community and Service Commission. She was also an officer in the National Center for Voluntary Action and co-chairwoman of the National Congress on Volunteerism and Citizenship.         Mrs. Black served as the co-chairwoman of New York City's Voluntary Action Council under Mayors John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. Since 1986, she had been the executive director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Office for Voluntary Service, the only paid job she ever held. Won Mayoral Award 3 Times         In 1988, Leonard W. Stern, executive director of the National Assembly, a coalition of charitable organizations, called her "the ultimate volunteer."         "She has probably done more work in more organizations at higher levels and had more influence than any private citizen," he said at the time.         Three times she won the Mayoral Award for Outstanding Voluntary Service. She was also honored by the New York Medical Society, the Hospital Association of New York State and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         Children and health were her major themes and she was a leading advocate of improving day and foster care.         At her death, she was president of the Day Care Council of New York City. She had also headed the Child Welfare League of America, the Y.M.W.C.A. Day Care Corporation and the New York State Advisory Committee on Day Care.         Appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, she was the first woman to serve on the New York State Banking Board.

While studying at Skidmore College, where she graduated in 1948, she volunteered as a nurse's aide.         She attributed her career to her family roots, a pledge she made during an illness and guidance from an educator. Her grandfather, James Harkness, was a prosperous and civic-minded businessman. "I was born into a good life," she said, "and was encouraged to give back what I could."         Stricken with polio as a young adult, she said she vowed to help others if she recovered. When she considered becoming a social worker, she said Dr. Alex Rosen, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, had told her, "You will do a lot more good going on boards, raising money and getting involved in direct service to meet community needs."         Surviving are her husband of 43 years, Hiram D. Black, a retired lawyer and financial consultant; a daughter, Suzanne O'Toole of Darien, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Morris of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.

         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died yesterday afternoon at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said. "I think it was probably the effects of the disease coupled with the fact that she was 83 years old," Ms. Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminisences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues.         While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor.         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me":         "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century."         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong docummentary by a California filmmaker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominently Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, she was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' " Lessons From the Family Cook         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer.         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers, while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may was well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941. Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         In 1943, she published "The Gastronomical Me," (Duell, Sloan & Pearce) followed by "Here Let Us Feast (Viking) in 1946. Her novel, "Not Now But Now," was published by Viking in 1947. Her translation from French of "The Physiology of Taste" was published in 1949, the same year that "An Alphabet for Gourmets" appeared.         "A Cordiall Water," a slender volume of folk cures, was published by Little, Brown in 1961. Three years later, the same publisher brought out "A Map of Another Town," a reminiscence of the years she spent in Aix-en-Provence. In 1968, Putnam published "With Bold Knife and Fork," and Mrs. Fisher joined Julia Child and Michael Field as consultants to the Time-Life book "The Cooking of Provencal France."         Throughout these decades, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Fried two years later. An Appetite for Writing         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Viking.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991.         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say," she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Margaret Carthy, former president of the College of New Rochelle and dean of its graduate school, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She was known as Mother Mary Peter during her long career as a Roman Catholic college administrator.         She had Alzheimer's disease and died of pneumonia, said Sister Eileen Fane, prioress of the Convent of St. Teresa, an Ursuline community in New Rochelle.         Sister Margaret was born and raised in Manhattan and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1933. She worked for several years in the business office at Teachers College at Columbia University but, after taking her vows in the Order of St. Ursuline in 1939, she returned to New Rochelle to teach at the Ursuline School. A Former Dean         Sister Margaret began her years in the administration at the College of New Rochelle as assistant registrar in 1941 and served as dean of the college from 1950 to 1957 and then as president until 1961. She earned a master's and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in American church history at Catholic University in Washington.         She added a master's degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and worked for four years as staff editor of The New Catholic Encyclopedia while also lecturing at Catholic University. She then taught at the University of Maryland, becoming assistant director of the general ecducation program and then assistant dean of graduate studies.         In 1975, she returned to her alma mater to accept the post of dean of the graduate school, which she held until her retirement in 1979.         Both before and after her retirement, Sister Margaret wrote articles and books about American church history, including "Catholicism in English-Speaking Lands" (Hawthorn Books, 1964). Much of her writing focused on the Archdiocese of New York, including "A Cathedral of Suitable Magnificence" (St. Patrick's, 1984). In addition, she served as archivist for the Eastern Province of the Ursulines.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Connolly of Jericho, L.I., and many nieces and nephews.       
         Deborah R. Linfield, a senior litigation attorney for The New York Times Company, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her family said Ms. Linfield, who had never smoked, died of lung cancer, which was diagnosed 19 months ago. She had recently been accepted into a research treatment program conducted by the National Institutes of Health at the Garden State Cancer Center in Newark and had been there last week for an initial treatment with radiated monoclonal antibodies.         Ms. Linfield, a 1978 graduate of the New York University School of Law, where she was awarded the American College of Trial Lawyers Medal for Excellence in Advocacy, had been a litigation associate at Willkie Farr & Gallagher for two years and then at Baer Marks & Upham for seven years before joining the Times Company in 1987. She received a Bachelor of Science with honor in psychology from Tufts University. First Amendment Cases         At the Times Company, Ms. Linfield was active in a number of areas of litigation, but her specialty was First Amendment cases involving the press's right of access to court proceedings. She successfully argued for The Times in broadening access rights in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the prosecution of Mario Biaggi, and in New York State's Appellate Division for both the Howard Beach racial-attack case and Joel B. Steinberg child-brutality case.         She was an active member of the City Bar Association and served on both the Committee on Communication Law and the Committee on Women in the Profession.         Ms. Linfield is survived by her 9-year-old daughter, Sarah Linfield Mattingly; by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan L. Linfield of Brooklyn, and by her sister, Susan Linfield of Manhattan.

'On the Outside Looking In'         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F.

Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."

The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941:         "An oyster leads a dreadful but exciting life. Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it." Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         She saw little room at the table for caution. In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters.

A Delicious Meal Of a Bookish Kind         Here are nine of the better-known books written by M.F.K. Fisher over the course of six decades. She wrote a total of 15.         "The Gastronomical Me" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1943), collected essays.         "Here Let Us Feast (Viking, 1946), collected essays.         "Not Now But Now" (Viking, 1947), a novel.

         The Rev. Page E. Smith Bigelow, one of the first women to be ordained in the Episcopal Church, died Wednesday in St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. She was 69 years old and lived in Maplewood, N.J.         She died of cardiac arrest after a lengthy illness, her family said.         A graduate of Wells College and the General Theological Seminary in New York City, she was ordained in January 1977 after spending two years as a deacon. She served as a priest in the city's Episcopal Church Center, then as a vicar in West Milford, N.J. For the past six years her home parish had been St. George's Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Newark.         She is survived by her husband, William S.; a daughter, Page E., also of Maplewood; two sons, John O. 3d of Maplewood and William S. Jr. of Lebanon Township, N.J.; a sister, Thalia B. Husted of Mantoloking, N.J., and one grandchild.       
         Mabel Randall Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in the creation of its programs to help troubled children, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after a long illness, her family said.         Miss Thomas served as the first full-time executive director of the organization, from 1952 until her retirement about 25 years later. Big Sisters eventually merged with the Big Brothers organization.         During her tenure, Big Sisters built a staff of social workers, psychologists and other professionals and opened offices in courts across the city to help neglected, delinquent or otherwise troubled youngsters. The annual caseload jumped from a relative handful to thousands. Her efforts won awards from the City Bar Association in New York and Community Trust.         Miss Thomas was born in Montgomery, Ala. She graduated from the University of Alabama in 1939. During World War II she worked on the staff of the U.S.O. at Fort McClellan, Ala., and later for the Red Cross. She resumed her studies at Columbia University, where she earned a master's degree in social work in 1952.         She is survived by two brothers, William of Montgomery and Walton of Milwaukee, and three sisters, Jean Walker of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Anna Atherton and Ethel Golson, both of Montgomery.         Correction:  July 21, 1992, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Mabel R. Thomas, who led the Big Sisters of New York in helping troubled children, referred incorrectly to the status of the organization. It is independent, and separate from Big Brothers.       
         Olga Loeb, a trustee of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center who did volunteer work for more than five decades, died on Sunday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 97 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Loeb managed her gift shop at the hospital on Friday as usual and died at Northern Dutchess Hospital of complications after an asthma attack, said a hospital spokesman. She was on a family visit when she became ill.         She was a native of Vienna who moved to the Bronx in 1911.         As a girl, she collected pennies for a new dispensary that became a forerunner of the hospital that her future husband helped to found in 1927 -- Bronx-Lebanon on the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section. A Buyer for Store Chains         She studied at Syracuse University and then built a successful career buying merchandise for department-store chains. She returned to the Bronx at the age of 40 and married Dr. Martin J. Loeb, a surgeon and philanthropist.         Mrs. Loeb became active in the hospital's Ladies' Auxiliary in 1942 and had been its president since 1953. She also served as an officer or head of various hospital committees as well as the Comprehensive Planning Board for her local health district.         After her husband's death in 1961, Mrs. Loeb persuaded the hospital board to convert part of a waiting room into a gift shop that she would run with a few volunteers. It sells flowers and teddy bears among other things and has raised more than $1 million for the hospital. Mrs. Loeb herself opened the shop every weekday at 7:30 A.M. and closed it at 5 P.M.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Jean Baer Fensterheim, a writer of personal self-help books and magazine articles aimed especially at women, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Herbert Fensterheim.         A native of Chicago and a 1944 graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Baer scored her first success as an author in 1965 when Macmillan began "Follow Me!," a travel guide for single women looking for a husband abroad. At the time, she was single and the publicity director for Seventeen magazine. The book grew from her experiences during more than a dozen trips to Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.         This was followed in 1968 by "The Single Girl Goes to Town" (Macmillan). Months after its publication, she married Dr. Fensterheim, a clinical psychologist who also became her co-author. Together, they focused on psychological writings.         Their latest book was "Making Life Right When It Feels All Wrong" (Macmillan, 1988).         Outside the genre, Ms. Baer wrote "The Self-Chosen" (Arbor House, 1982), a book about what she called "the world of the Jewish elite" in the United States since World War II.         She was the secretary of the Overseas Press Club and served on its board of directors.         Ms. Baer is survived, in addition to Dr. Fensterheim, by a sister, Carol Norr of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, Robert Baer of Woodstock, N.Y.       
         Sister Josephine Morgan, whose work as director of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College helped raise the standards of sacred music, died on Friday at Kenwood Convent of the Sacred Heart in Albany. She was 83 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Sister Mary Lyman, the convent's pastoral care minister.         Sister Morgan, who was born in New York City, entered the Society of the Sacred Heart in 1923. A decade later, she began teaching music at Manhattanville College, in Purchase, N.Y.         During her tenure as director of the Pius X School from 1952 to 1969, she helped renew an interest in Gregorian chants and other forms of music used in the Roman Catholic liturgy. In 1961, Pope John XXIII cited the school for its role in improving the quality of liturgical music.         From 1971 until her retirement in 1977, she served as superior of the Kenwood Convent, where she continued to live.         She is survived by a brother, Arthur J. Morgan of Westhampton Beach, L.I.       
         Irene Silva de Santolalla, a Peruvian educator and author who in 1956 became the first woman in the country to be elected senator, died on Thursday at her home in Lima, the capital. She was 90 years old.         Her family said yesterday that she died after a long illness. Further details were not available.         Mrs. Santolalla was honored by many governments for her writing on children and adolescents and her efforts to raise awareness of the importance of family relations. The Union of American Women, a private group based in Washington with chapters in most Latin American countries, named her its Woman of the Americas in 1956.         The Peruvian Government honored her with its highest award, the Order of the Sun, 10 years ago.         Elected to the Senate in 1956, she served for six years and won praise as the author of a law on family education enacted in Peru in 1957.         Mrs. Santolalla also founded Government institutes for training teachers in Peruvian cities and was a sought-after lecturer throughout Europe and Latin America on family education and child development.         She wrote several books on the conditions faced by children and adolescents and served as an adviser to the United Nations and two of its agencies, Unesco and Unicef.         She is survived by her husband of 71 years, Fausto Santolalla Bernal, 101 years old; two daughters, Irene Santolalla Silva and Maria Teresa Santolalla Silva, and a son, Javier Santolalla Silva, all of Lima; nine grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Marion P. Ames, a major force for court reform in New York State for 35 years and a leader in many other public causes, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.         She died after an operation for spinal bone cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ames was a Wall Street lawyer for 10 years but left that career to rear her children and concentrate on volunteer activities.         She worked to consolidate the antiquated system of diverse state and local courts, give proper financing and modern management, provide for discipline in instances of judicial misconduct, eliminate political abuses and promote merit selection of jurists.         The American Judicature Society, a national group for improving the courts, honored her with an award for the major progress she made on all those points. Led League of Women Voters         Serving as the president of the State League of Women Voters and head of its courts committee, Mrs. Ames waged her campaign in speeches, reports, news releases, lobbying, coalitions, testimony at hearings and letters to the editor.         She also served as vice chairwoman of the state Committee for Modern Courts, a non-profit organization. In 1973 Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her to a new State Judicial Screening Committee -- and she publicly criticized its limitations.         "She really was the guiding light of the league's work, which played a lead role in court reform," said Elizabeth Hubbard, executive director of the Committee for Modern Courts. "She was always at the center of the movement to improve the system, someone we and political leaders and other groups always looked up to."         Mrs. Ames's other activities included serving as the board chairwoman of the College of New Rochelle and vice chairwoman of Barnard College.         She also led private social service agencies as president of the statewide Health and Welfare Network, New York Communities Aid Association and State Association for Community Services. Broad Spectrum of Causes         Among the issues she championed were liberalized voter registration laws, permanent political primary schedules, equitable welfare benefits and education aid, impartial legislative redistricting, an improved automobile insurance system and the release of mental patients from state institutions to local residences with support services.         Mrs. Ames was born in Manhattan. Her nickname was Pat, from her maiden name, Patterson.         She graduated from Barnard in 1937 and Fordham Law School in 1943. Her law practice specialized in estates, trusts and labor law.         Surviving are her husband of 51 years, George J. Ames, a partner in Lazard Freres & Company; four daughters, Ruth Solie of Northampton, Mass., Joan Berkowitz of Guilford, Conn., Margery E. Ames of Manhattan and Dorothy Cummings of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, William H. Patterson of Cincinnati, and five grandchildren.

         Peggy Zinsser Douglas, who helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the arts and other charitable causes in 60 years of volunteer work, died on Saturday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 94 years old.         Her family said she died of unspecified natural causes.         Mrs. Douglas raised more than $100 million for the Metropolitan Opera and a few times more than that for all her other causes, said John O'Keefe, a longtime friend who worked with her for Lincoln Center. She lived much of her life in Manhattan.         She served on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Red Cross, the United Negro College Fund and Lincoln Center and was chairwoman of funds, committees and benefits for these organizations.         "Peg Douglas has been one of our secret weapons," Amyas Ames, the chairman of Lincoln Center, said in 1980 when Mrs. Douglas retired from the board of directors. "Whenever we had a tough nut of a corporate chief to crack, we'd send Peg to see him. She'd go in and in her quiet, forceful manner, she netted millions of corporate dollars."         Mrs. Douglas was also a leader in the English-Speaking Union, Women's Volunteer Service in London, Volunteer Parents, Child Adoption Service, a New York State panel on education and the Institute of International Education, an organization for exchange students. She also supported Lenox Hill Hospital and Shakespearean theater.         For 54 years she was married to Lewis W. Douglas. He was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first budget director, Ambassador to England under President Harry S. Truman and president of McGill University and the Mutual Life Insurance Company.         An active partner in his career, she helped him campaign for Congress and entertain dignitaries in London. The Douglases became friends of Winston Churchill and were among the few Americans invited to attend his funeral.         Concurring in her husband's break with President Roosevelt, Mrs. Douglas supported the Republican candidate in 1940, Wendell L. Willkie. Mrs. Douglas presided over the unveiling of a giant poster in Times Square saying, "No Third Term!" Mr. Douglas rejoined the Roosevelt Administration to help direct shipping in World War II.         Mrs. Douglas was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and graduated from Smith College.         Her family founded the Zinsser Chemical Company. Her sister, Ellen, married John J. McCloy, an adviser to several American Presidents, and a cousin married Konrad Adenauer, a Chancellor of West Germany.         Surviving are a daughter, Sharman Douglas of Manhattan; two sons, James of Tucson and Lewis Jr. of Denver; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Jean T. Chorley, a former professional singer and a civic leader, died on Saturday at her home in Skillman, N.J. She was 88 years old.         She had a history of heart disease and died in her sleep, her family said.         From 1934-41 she sang professionally as a mezzo-soprano under the stage name of Jean Travers. She performed at Radio City Music Hall, with the St. Louis Opera Company, on the Rudy Vallee and Chase & Sanborn radio shows and in concerts nationally and in Canada and Europe.         She was born Jeanette Baumohl in Manhattan. Her first husband, Morris Treistman, died in 1937. She remarried in 1941, to Kenneth Chorley.         Mr. Chorley, a close associate of Laurance S. and John D. Rockefeller Jr., served for 23 years as president of the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project and was an officer of several nonprofit organizations.         During that period, Mrs. Chorley and her husband entertained foreign officials and royalty. In the 1950's they restored an old brick farmhouse in Hopewell, N.J., and filled it with 18th-century antiques and English pottery. Mr. Chorley died in 1974.         Mrs. Chorley served as the board president of the Old Barracks Association, an American Revolution historical organization in Trenton, and also coached the lay readers at the Trinity Episcopalian Church in Princeton.         Surviving are a stepson, Edward C. Chorley of White Plains, 5 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Marian A. Granowitz, a former vice chairwoman of the Republican State and Westchester County Committees, died on Thursday at Westchester Square Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 78 years old and a lifelong resident of Port Chester, N.Y.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         Mrs. Granowitz's unpaid party work was a labor of love. Moving steadily up the ladder of leadership in the Westchester organization in the 1970's and 1980's, she served as its vice chairwoman, then regional vice chairwoman to coordinate Republican activities in five counties. She finally became a state vice chairwoman.         Born in Port Chester, she graduated from public high school and went to work for B. Altman's White Plains store. She headed its cosmetics department but quit to raise her children.         Her husband, Irving M. Granowitz, a certified public accountant, died in 1975.         Mrs. Granowitz is survived by two daughters, Ida Granowitz of Manhattan, and Tina Marks of Hartsdale, N.Y.; a son, Philip of Stanford, Conn.; a brother, Milton Smith of Port Chester, and three grandchildren.       
         Antoinette M. Kraushaar, the owner of one of New York City's oldest art galleries, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         She died of natural causes related to old age, said Carole Pesner, the director of Kraushaar Galleries Inc.         Miss Kraushaar was born in Manhattan on Dec. 25, 1902, into a family of art dealers, and she spent her life in the New York art world. While still a teen-ager, she went to work as a stenographer in the gallery that her uncle, Charles W. Kraushaar, founded in 1885 and that her father, John Kraushaar, inherited at his brother's death in 1917. Originally on Broadway at 33d Street, Kraushaar Galleries has moved five times in its 107-year history; since 1981, it has occupied a floor in 724 Fifth Avenue, a gallery building near 57th Street. Mrs. Pesner said yesterday that the gallery would continue to operate.         In its first years, the gallery concentrated on European artists, especially the Barbizon School of landscape painters. Under Miss Kraushaar's father, it became known for its close association with American artists. For many years it was the primary representative of the sculptor Gaston Lachaise, the painters Guy Pene du Bois and Charles Demuth, and several members of the group of American realists known as "the Eight," most notably George Luks, William Glackens, Maurice Prendergast and John Sloan.         In 1917, Luks painted a full-length portrait of Miss Kraushaar in a white graduation dress that has been widely reproduced and exhibited over the years. In the 1920's, Lachaise also sculptured a head of the dealer. Earlier this year, she gave the Luks portrait to the Brooklyn Museum, where it is on view in conjunction with the current exhibition "The Eight."         Miss Kraushaar took over the running of the gallery when her father became ill in the 1930's and became its owner at his death in 1946. She retired from its day-to-day management in 1988. Under her tenure the gallery continued to exhibit American realists. In the last decade, it has mounted large shows of Glackens and Sloan, and it continues to represent the Luks estate. But it also represents abstract artists, including William Kienbusch, Carl Morris and Sonia Gechtoff.         In 1961, Miss Kraushaar was among the handful of New York gallery owners who founded the Art Dealers Association of America; she served for many years on its board. In her later years, she was known for her receptiveness to younger art dealers and the work they exhibited.         She is survived by a nephew, Charles W. Kraushaar of Manhattan.       
         Alice Woodard Fordyce, a philanthropist whose support of medical research in the last five decades included her involvement in the awarding of one of science's most prestigious prizes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Fordyce died of heart failure, her son, James Woodard Fordyce, said.         For almost 50 years, Mrs. Fordyce and her sister, Mary Woodard Lasker, were the driving forces behind the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, which awarded the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards.         The $15,000 awards, given for significant achievement in basic and medical research, have long been considered second in prestige only to the Nobel Prizes. Forty-nine Lasker Award recipients were later awarded the Nobel Prize.         The foundation and the awards program were founded by Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. Lasker and her husband, Albert, in 1944 to draw attention to major achievements in basic and clinical medical research and stimulate Federal financing of research. Mr. Lasker died in 1952.         Mrs. Fordyce served as executive vice president of the foundation and director of the awards program until December 1990. She remained a member of the foundation's board and a consultant to the awards program until her death.         Mrs. Fordyce, who was born in Watertown, Wis., the daughter of a bank president, graduated from Smith College in 1928 and studied at the Sorbonne and the University of Grenoble in France. The sisters' interest in supporting medical research stemmed from the ear infections that Mary Lasker endured and from both their mother and father's suffering from hypertension.         Mrs. Fordyce served on many governmental committees and with health-related organizations, including the United States branch of the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the International Council for Coordinating Cancer Research, the United States Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation, the Rockefeller University Council, the Geriatric Advisory Council of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Psychiatry Department at Columbia University.         Mrs. Fordyce was also involved with civic activities that included the American Museum in Britain, the Leeds Castle Foundation, Bargemusic and the Port of Entry Program at Queensboro College, which helps Chinese students learn American customs and practices.         Mrs. Fordyce's husband, A. Grant Fordyce, an architect, whom she married in 1939, died in 1972. She is survived by her sister, Mary Lasker of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.; her son, James of Greenwhich, and three grandsons.       
         Harriet W. Sheridan, former undergraduate dean at Brown University, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 67 years old and lived in Barrington, R.I.         The cause of death was cancer, said Don DeMaio, a Brown spokesman.         Professor Sheridan was hired as dean at Brown in 1979 and remained in the post until 1987, when she resigned to return to her longtime career, the teaching of English. She later founded the Center for the Advancement of College Teaching at the university and was noted for her course on literature and medicine, which proved popular with many medical students.         She had arrived at Brown from Carleton College in Minnesota, where she had spent 26 years and had served at various times as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, chairwoman of the English department and faculty chairwoman. She was also Carleton's acting president from January to August of 1977, succeeding Howard Swearer, who had resigned to become president at Brown.         A native of Manhattan, she received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1944, a master's from Smith College in 1945 and a doctorate in medieval English literature from Yale University in 1950.         Professor Sheridan was chairwoman of the American Association for Higher Education and a member of many educational groups, including the American Council on Education's Commission on Women in Higher Education. She was a former director of the Association of American Colleges and a former member of the Commission on Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.         She is survived by her husband, Philip; two daughters, Alison Buffum of Narrangansett, R.I., and Roo Sheridan of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.       
         Clara Rotter, for many years secretary of The New York Times drama department and a well-known figure in Broadway circles, died on Sunday at her home in Woodside, Queens. She was 82 years old.         She died after a long illness, said her brother Alex, of Queens.         Miss Rotter served as the conduit between the newspaper's critics and those involved in productions. Producers, writers, directors and, of course, press agents knew her well. They also knew her role as intermediary between them and the critics, whom she shielded, as they wanted, from pleadings and promotions. Such was her reputation that a question once put to applicants who wanted to join the theater press agents' union was "Who is Clara Rotter?"         Though frail and diminutive, Miss Rotter had a strong will and a determination to accomplish any chore to ease the paths of critics and reporters.         Brooks Atkinson, the Times drama critic when she came to the department, once sent off a letter and then remarked that he wished he hadn't written it. Miss Rotter worked her way by telephone through the post office hierarchy and was assured that retrieval was impossible. She persisted and learned the home telephone number of the top man. When she called, she was told he was dining at a restaurant. She telephoned him there and, according to colleagues at The Times, the letter was withdrawn. A Friend of the Famous         During her time in the drama department, which began shortly after she joined The Times in 1945, Miss Rotter made many friendships with the famous on Broadway and its auxiliary fields. Her correspondence with the playwright Sean O'Casey resulted in a flood of letters that in themselves constituted a literary legacy now included in the Billy Rose Theater Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.         During most of her secretarial career, Miss Rotter worked with Mr. Atkinson. When he died in 1984 after retiring from The Times in 1965, he left her $2,500, which she donated to the Brooks Atkinson Memorial Playwright Exchange of New Dramatists to assist talented young playwrights.         Miss Rotter served with several later critics before retiring at the age of 70. For several years she continued to act as liaison in the purchase of theater tickets for the parent New York Times Company.         In addition to her brother Alex, she is survived by another brother, Leonard, of Syosset, L.I.       
         Mary Wells Ashworth, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, died on Saturday at the Henrico Doctors' Hospital in Richmond, Va. She was 89 years old and lived in Richmond.         Mrs. Ashworth died of a ruptured aorta, said her son, Osbourne Orlando Ashworth Jr. of Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Ashworth grew up in Florida and moved to Virginia with her family as a teen-ager. She graduated from Hollins College in Hollins, Va., in 1924, and later served on the college's board.         For many years, Mrs. Ashworth was a research associate of the historian Douglas Southall Freeman, the author of a multi-volume biography of George Washington. After Professor Freeman died in 1953, she and another research associate, John A. Carroll, wrote the seventh and final volume of Freeman's authoritative "George Washington, a Biography" published by Scribner's in 1957. The entire work won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1958 and Columbia University's Loubat Prize the same year.         Mrs. Ashworth also contributed to the World Book Encyclopedia and to the compendium "Notable American Women 1607-1950."         Mrs. Ashworth's husband, Dr. Osbourne O. Ashworth, a physician, died in 1945. In addition to her son Osbourne, Mrs. Ashworth is survived by another son, Dr. John Sheriden Ashworth of Richmond.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Disney MacKaye, who chronicled marital woes and dispensed advice for 30 years through a column in The Ladies' Home Journal, "Can This Marriage Be Saved?", died on Saturday at her summer home in Guilford, Conn. She was 88 years old and lived in Guilford and Washington.         She died of a heart attack, said her son, William R. MacKaye of Washington.         Mrs. MacKaye, who wrote under the byline Dorothy Cameron Disney, was something of a pioneer both as an advice columnist and a marriage counselor, and for generations of readers her column -- entertaining, occasionally titillating, sometimes a little pedantic -- served as a spyglass into the lives of anonymous strangers.         The column, which first appeared in January 1953, continues today. In Mrs. MacKaye's hands it was devoted each month to the travails of a married couple. Based on interviews and then written largely in dialogue, as if in the voices of the troubled partners, the columns dealt with issues like jealousy, infidelity, money problems and, increasingly as time went on and moral strictures relaxed, sexual problems.         "The columns seem to represent a chronicle of the many changes in the institution of marriage -- and the fascination it holds," Mrs. MacKaye said in a retrospective essay written for the 100th anniversary issue of The Ladies' Home Journal in January 1984. Looking back on her three decades as a columnist, she concluded that of all marital problems, "the single greatest pitfall of all times" is the inability of husband and wife to communicate. " 'He (or she) never listens' is universal," she wrote.         By the time she began her career as a columnist, she was the author of nine mystery novels, and she believed she was successful as a columnist, her son said in an interview, because of her training as a storyteller. Her technique, he said, was to take her prospective subject couple out to dinner to prime and cajole them and then afterward to speak with them separately. She would also interview their marriage counselor.         In the column, the names were never divulged and identifying details were not provided. "She would always tell the couples that unless they told their friends they'd never be recognized," her son said. "Those people who told their friends were invariably recognized -- and embarrassed."         In the beginning, the column was a collaboration between Mrs. MacKaye and Dr. Paul Popenoe, the founder of the American Institute of Family Relations, a marriage counseling agency in Hollywood. Dr. Popenoe put her in touch with his patients, who then became her subjects. Later on, as the column became more well known, Mrs. MacKaye made it entirely her own, calling on counseling agencies across the country for source material.         Mrs. MacKaye was born in 1904 in Atoka, Indian Territory, part of what became the State of Oklahoma in 1907, and grew up in Muskogee. Her father, Loren G. Disney, was a lawyer and a local political figure. She attended several colleges, including George Washington University and Barnard College, but never graduated. Her son said her explanation for this was that she refused to take any science courses.         Mrs. MacKaye's marriage to Milton MacKaye, a magazine writer, endured for 50 years until his death in 1979.         In her addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter-in-law, Mary Anne MacKaye, and five grandchildren.       
         Eleanor H. Raynolds, an executive search consultant who was honored by the Queen of England for her work for the British-American Chamber of Commerce, died on Tuesday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. She was 55 years old and lived in Stamford.         The cause of her death was a massive staphylococcus infection, said Penny Paul Mooney, an associate at Ward Howell, the executive search firm where she was a partner. She said the cause of the infection has not been determined.         Mrs. Raynolds joined Ward Howell in 1985. Founder of Peer Group         During the early 1980's, she served consecutive terms as president of the British-American Chamber of Commerce, for which she was made a Commander of the British Empire. She was also a founder of the Peer Group, a national association of women in management and the arts, and served as a director of the New York Mission Society, the Women's Economic Round table and Mary Baldwin College.         Together with her husband, John F. Raynolds 3d, former president of Outward Bound USA, she wrote "Beyond Success -- How Volunteer Service Can Help You Begin Making a Life Insead of Just a Living."         Mrs. Raynolds, who trekked in the Himalayas and the Andes and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, had just returned from a horse-riding trip in Utah when she died.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, a son, Jayson Kuhn of Silver Spring, Md., and a daughter, Jennifer Irwin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and by two grandchildren.       
         Sayedah Khadijah Faisal, a founder of Brooklyn's first mosque who was known to hundreds of Muslims as Mother Khadijah, died Saturday at her home at the mosque in Brooklyn Heights. She was 93 years old.         Officials of the mosque, the Islamic Mission of America, said she died after a long illness, which they did not specify.         Mother Khadijah founded the mosque in 1939 with her husband, Sheik Daoud Ahmed Faisal, who served as its imam, or spiritual leader, until his death in 1980.         She and her husband worked to bring immigrant Muslims and new American converts to the faith together in one mosque. The success of their effort was evident at her funeral there yesterday, where Muslims from Pakistan and Morocco prayed shoulder to shoulder with American black converts. The mosque is situated in a former mansion at 143 State Street in Brooklyn Heights.         During noon prayers that preceded the funeral, which was attended by several hundred people, the plain pine coffin was kept in the rear of the mosque amid a large group of women who had come to mourn. Afterward, the men of the mosque brought the casket forward for a brief service in Arabic that was centered on the belief that the deceased was merely passing on to another life.         Belquis Abdur Raheem, a teacher at an Islamic elementary school, brought seven of her pupils to the funeral. "It is important for them to see an important part of Islamic history pass on," she said. "All of these children and their parents grew up with Mother Khadijah being known to them as a focal point of Islam."         In addition to being a founder of the mosque, Mother Khadijah served as its secretary and treasurer and led its Muslim Ladies Cultural Society.         For many years, the mosque was the only one in Brooklyn and, as a result, her leadership was broader than Brooklyn Heights. She also traveled around the country with her husband, addressing women's groups on Islam.         Mother Khadijah, who was born in Bermuda, is survived by her second husband, Imam Omar Bey, and by several nieces and nephews in Bermuda.       
         Bertha Levin, a longtime supporter of Jewish causes in New York City and Israel, died on Thursday at her home in Jerusalem. She was 98 years old.         She had been suffering from pneumonia, a family spokeswoman said.         In New York Mrs. Levin was a founding member of the Young Israel Movement and a pioneer member of Hadassah who worked with its founder, Henrietta Szold, during World War I. She moved to Israel in 1961, where she served on the Committee to Beautify Jerusalem.         Born Bertha Lebendiger, she was a native of New York City. As a young woman she was a suffragette and was the first woman admitted to membership in the New York Credit Managers Association, in the World War I era.  For 25 years she was married to Harry Levin, a lawyer who died in 1945.         She is survived by two daughters, Tova Solter of Ramat Chen, Israel, and Ora Zohar of Jerusalem; three sons, David, of Manhattan, Ezra, of the Bronx and Jonathan, of Bethesda, Md.; 13 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.       
         Natalie deWolf Paine, a television production administrator at CBS News and at the Columbia University Seminars on Media and Society, died on Wednesday. She was 62 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.         Mrs. Paine's death was reported by her husband, Kenneth Paine, who said she died of cancer at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.         Mrs. Paine joined CBS News as a staff administrator in 1951 and served as staff administrator for the "See It Now" and "CBS Reports" programs, with Edward R. Murrow reporting and Fred W. Friendly producing.         Mr. Friendly described Mrs. Paine yesterday as "a central link, our gyroscope" in coordinating production and information gathering.         She resigned from CBS in 1964 to raise a family. In 1982 she rejoined Mr. Friendly, who was directing Columbia University's seminars on the media and society and helped to produce more than 600 of them.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Nicolas, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Jenifer, of Boston; two stepdaughters, Emily Paine of Los Angeles and Rachel Wilson of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Edith Sable, a longtime civic leader who fostered voter participation and recruited public officials and business leaders to debate New York City's problems and future, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         For four decades Mrs. Sable was a League of Women Voters volunteer and officer. She was the economic development director of its New York chapter and was also on the national board.         She focused on the city's government structure, financing and management, as well as its economy. In the city and state fiscal crises in the 1970's, she convened seminars for officials and others to learn about and discuss finances and charter reform.         "Edith's meetings were one of the best sources of background information," said Elizabeth Cooke, then a municipal union lobbyist and now president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. "Personal and political agendas were pretty much put aside, and thoughtful people struggled with difficult issues." Published 'They Represent You'         Mrs. Sable's later conferences examined city management in 1979, the capital budget process in 1981, infrastructure in 1983, public authorities in 1985 and contract procedures in 1989. She also organized sessions on the city's economy with officials, executives and economists speaking and touring sites from the Fresh Kills landfill to the Hunts Point market.         She started the league's popular reference booklet "They Represent You and Your Community," listing elected officials with their addresses and telephone numbers and district maps.         When the city created community boards, she produced an explanatory pamphlet. And to visualize the city's economy and financing, she created charts titled "Money Go Round."         She also worked several stints in government. She served in the city transportation agency and in public relations for Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She was also an aide to Angier Biddle Duke and Eleanor Roosevelt at the United Nations.         Mrs. Sable, whose maiden name was Berger, was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University. Her husband of 48 years, Benjamin, died in 1986. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Bertina Suida Manning, a scholar of Italian art and a collector of French and Italian paintings and drawings, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         She died of heart failure, said a friend, Mary Jane Harris.         Mrs. Manning was born in Vienna and was the only child of William E. Suida, an eminent Viennese art historian known for his work on Leonardo da Vinci and Genoese painting. She moved with her parents to the United States in 1939 and attended Queens College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she met her husband, Robert Lee Manning, an art collector who became director of the art gallery at Finch College in Manhattan.         With her father, she wrote a book on Luca Cambiaso, a 16th- century Genoese painter. From her father, Mrs. Manning inherited thousands of Italian and French paintings and drawings, to which she and her husband added major works. During the 1950's she advised the collector Walter P. Chrysler Jr. In 1962-63, she and her husband organized the first United States exhibition of Genoese painting, which traveled from Dayton, Ohio, to Sarasota, Fla., to Hartford. Since 1989 she had served as president of the Godwin-Ternbach Museum at Queens College.         The Mannings were known for making their collection at their home available to students, curators and many others from around the world. Works from the Suida Manning collection have been donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and the National Gallery in Washington, among other institutions. Paintings by Guercino and Mattia Preti are among the works now on loan to the Metropolitan, where they are on view in the museum's galleries of Baroque painting.         She is survived by her husband; her daughter, Sandy Manning Dolnier, and a grandson, John Robert Dylan.       
         Elinor Kridel Bernheim, a social-welfare volunteer whose widely cast interests ranged from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and Columbia University's School of Social Work to a community center she founded in the Bronx, died yesterday at her Upper East Side home. She was 85 years old.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Bernheim relentlessly made the rounds of board rooms, foundation offices and charity luncheons and dinners, starting in the 1940's. In 1975, she still sat on the boards of 11 charities. At the time, The New York Times's About New York column described her as "The Queen of Volunteers," who was "the champion volunteer worker in town."         "I love this kind of work," she said between meetings with people who held the purse strings to grants for worthy causes. Sometimes it kept her busy for 15 hours a day, she said.         "You know why we do it?" she asked. "Because it shows we're alive. So many of the younger women now want to get paid. It's a status thing with them."         "I'll tell you what I'm good at," she declared. "I'm good at finding people for boards because I know a lot of people. I'm good at organizing, fund-raising and whipping up enthusiasm.         "I don't fight with anyone unless I have to get things done -- and then I'm a dog, very mean." She also was a critic of professional social-work jargon that she said could scare otherwise interested laypeople off.         Mrs. Bernheim, whose late husband, Leonard, was a stockbroker, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1985. She recovered enough to return to the causes closest to her heart -- in a wheelchair or by telephone -- until her death.         Among those lasting interests were the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center, which she began in the 1950's and presided over until 1970. It was innovative because it was affiliated with a hospital, Montefiore Medical Center. Others included the New York chapter of the National Council on Alcoholism and Young Concert Artists, which helps talented young people to start a career.         Also remaining dear to her heart was the New York School of Social Work at Columbia, a place where she did postgraduate work after her 40th birthday, in the 1947-48 academic year. She later served as a member of its advisory board and took special pride when Columbia awarded her its Bicentennial Medal in 1956. It was but one of many honors bestowed on her.         Mrs. Bernheim was born Elinor Kridel in New York City on June 26, 1907, and graduated from Vassar College in 1928. By 1941, she was a member of the board and the council of the Association for Aid for Crippled Children.         Her relationship with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies went back to her years as a young woman. She became a trustee in 1942 and two years later was co-host of a luncheon addressed by Eleanor Roosevelt.         She served as chairwoman of the women's division fund campaigns in 1943, 1944 and 1949. After that, she became a vice president of the federation and board chairwoman of the women's division.         Over the decades, Mrs. Bernheim also was an officer or otherwise involved in, among others, the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Conference for Social Welfare, an advisory committee on volunteer services for the Veterans Administration, the United Neighborhood Houses of New York City, the National Council on Social Work Education and the Associated Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Associations.         She was also involved with the Community Council of Greater New York, the Community Service Society, the National Homemakers Service Council and the Brookdale Institute on Aging, among others. She was a co-founder of the Florence G. Heller Research Center. She served three terms as vice president of the Community Council of Greater New York and was elected its first president in 1973.         Mrs. Bernheim's husband died in 1980. She is survived by two sons, Leonard H. Jr. and Charles A., both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Gertrude Farber Koskoff, a three-term Representative in the Connecticut General Assembly and former member of the State Board of Parole, died on Thursday at her home in Plainville, Conn. She was 81 years old.         She died of complications from pancreatic cancer, said her son, David.         Active in the Republican Party, Mrs. Koskoff served as a state legislator from 1953 to 1958. She focused on civil rights, the rights of the handicapped and prison reform.         During riots at the state's prisons in the 1950's, Representative Koskoff acted as a mediator at the request of the prisoners. In 1968, she was named to the Parole Board by Gov. John Dempsey, where she served until her retirement in 1990.         Besides her son, of Plainville, she is survived by her husband, Milton M. Koskoff; a daughter, Harriet K. Ziering of San Francisco; two brothers, Alan and Daniel Farber, both of Worcester, Mass; a sister, Lillian Feinberg of New York City, and a grandson.       
         Dr. Eleanor P. Spencer, a scholar of medieval art, died on Tuesday at Le Vieux Chateau, a retirement home near Paris. She was 97 years old.         Dr. Spencer was the first woman to receive the Sachs Fellowship for Research in the Fine Arts from Harvard University, which enabled her to earn a doctorate at Radcliffe College. Earlier, she had received a bachelor's and a master's degree from Smith College and had studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.         After nearly 10 years of teaching at Smith, at Mount Holyoke and at Wellesley, she became an associate professor of art at Goucher College in Baltimore and remained there until her retirement at age 67. While teaching at Goucher, she also served on the board of the Baltimore Museum of Art and other local art institutions, and was co-author with Richard H. Howland of "The Architecture of Baltimore: A Pictorial History."         After retiring, Dr. Spencer received a Fulbright grant and returned to Paris, where she researched 15th-century French book illustration and wrote articles for scholarly journals. Most of her work was devoted to the Sobieski Hours, a manuscript in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.         There are no survivors.       
         Audre Lorde, a black feminist writer who became the poet laureate of New York State in 1991, died on Tuesday at her home on St. Croix. She was 58 years old.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Blanche Cook.         Ms. Lorde had had cancer for 14 years and in 1980 wrote "The Cancer Journals," which traced the first stages of her disease.         From the publication of her first book in 1968, Ms. Lorde's 17 volumes of poetry, essays and autobiography reflected her hatred of racial and sexual prejudice. Among them are "Cables to Rage" (1970); "Coal" (1976); "Zami: A New Spelling of My Name" (1983), and, most recently, "Undersong: Chosen Poems Old and New," which was recently published by W. W. Norton.         A collection of essays, "A Burst of Light," won an American Book Award in 1989. Her 1973 collection, "From a Land Where Other People Live," was nominated for a National Book Award.  Active Politically and Academically         Ms. Lorde, who also used her adopted African name, Gamba Adisa, was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and the Columbia University School of Library Science. She became an English professor at Hunter and lectured widely throughout the United States, Europe and Africa.

         Carol Weil Haussamen, a New York City philanthropist, hostess and Democratic fund-raiser, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         Her family said she died of cancer of the esophagus.         Mrs. Haussamen, a real-estate heiress, was born in Manhattan, the daughter of L. Victor Weil, a real-estate executive, and the former Beatrice Schwab. She attended private schools, including the Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, acquired fluency in French from her governesses and traveled extensively when her mother showed horses. In those years the family also kept an estate in Elberon, N.J., where she spent her summers. Hostess to Ambassadors         From her father she inherited, among other properties, a building on Central Park South, and with it a palatial 20th-floor, 18-room apartment. For the last 25 years or more her home served as a fountainhead of funds for Democratic candidates from around the country.         She served as hostess for foreign ambassadors during the 1976 national convention, and she often entertained other visiting foreign dignitaries as well. She played a role in every subsequent campaign, though her family said that in this Presidential election year she had to curtail her activities somewhat because of her health.         She was the president of the nonprofit Carol W. Haussamen and Carolyndale Foundations, which she dedicated to the rehabilitation of housing for the poor. She also headed Forty Central Park South Inc., a company that owns and manages apartment buildings.         She served in various capacities on the Governor's Committee on Scholastic Achievement, Just One Break Inc., Manhattan Industrial Home for the Blind, Community Board No. 5, First Women's Bank of New York, Urban Design Council, Citizens Housing and Planning Council, Association for a Better New York, Mayor's Midtown Committee and Roosevelt Island Development Corporation.

         Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         Mrs. Furman died of complications of diabetes, said her family, which reported her death yesterday.         Mrs. Furman, who was a graduate of Finch College, had suffered from diabetes since infancy. She devoted her life to urging the public in general and those suffering from diabetes in particular to press for more research that might lead to a cure.         The foundation is the chief private financial supporter of scientific research on diabetes.         The New York Juvenile Diabetes Foundation chapter is the largest of the organization's 126 chapters in the United States and abroad. Mrs. Furman helped found the volunteer organization in the early 1970's, and served a year's term as president from 1974 to 1975. She also held several other positions with the foundation.         In 1992, Mrs. Furman received the Shining Star Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for her "longstanding commitment to find the cure for diabetes."         Mrs. Furman is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Julie Rosenthal, and two sons, Matthew and Ted, all of New York City.         Correction:  November 27, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, misstated her age. She was 52 years old.       
         Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller, a major benefactor of the Museum of Modern Art and the widow of John D. Rockefeller 3d, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 83 years old.         A family spokesman said the cause of death was Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia.         For four decades, Mrs. Rockefeller was a regal presence in philanthropy, helping to attract financial support and volunteers for causes ranging from children's welfare to the Juilliard School. Lay Administrator         But it was the Museum of Modern Art that was her predominant interest. She twice served as its president, although she insisted she had no curatorial expertise. "I'm not an expert on modern art," she once said, "just a person who has become interested."         Still, as a lay administrator, as she called herself, she had a major impact on the museum, leading a successful fund-raising campaign that enabled it to complete an expansion that doubled its gallery space.         These and other changes enabled the financially troubled museum to progress from a cultural institution dependent on the Rockefeller family and private support, to a more independent public institution attracting increased corporate and government support.         In 1979, while she was president, an expansion plan generated a dispute over the practice of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer to secure needed funds.         Mrs. Rockefeller, who upheld the sale, which brought in $17 million, was asked whether resorting to marketing techniques could be accomplished without jeopardizing the museum's standards.         "I hope so," she replied. "I hope we're not going to sell our birthright just to raise money. We have to find ways of doing it that don't compromise the basic premise of the museum, the reason for its existence." Believer in Hard Work         The innovative expansion program permitted the construction of a 52-story apartment tower at the Museum's 53d Street site, giving the museum additional exhibition space on lower floors. A law was also passed in Albany that, in effect, allowed the building's owners to give the museum a yearly sum that was the equivalent of taxes it would have paid to New York City. Other institutions have since copied that practice.         As the museum's president, Mrs. Rockefeller also favored adding new and younger trustees to the museum board, warning that they should not be named simply because they had wealth. She said, "We want them to bring some real contribution, like hard work."         Born in New York City on Oct. 2, 1909, Mrs. Rockefeller was heiress to the Ferry seed fortune through her mother. Her father was an engineer who became president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company.         She attended Miss Chapin's School for Girls, where she was known as "Hookie," and then Vassar College, graduating with a degree in music in 1931. A year later, she married Mr. Rockefeller, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr.         At 24, and newly married, she began her involvement in the city's charitable and civic activities, joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society, one of the country's oldest and largest private family and health agencies. She was the first woman elected vice chairman.         She was a trustee of the Brearley School and of Vassar College, and she shared her husband's many philanthropic interests and his pleasure in collecting art. He was interested particularly in Asian art, and the Rockefeller homes were adorned with both Asian and American works. She once described their personal art collection as a "mishmash."         Mr. Rockefeller left his Asian collection to the Asia Society, which he founded in 1956 to promote better relations between the Asian and American continents. He was killed in an automobile accident on July 10, 1978, before he fulfilled his plans to increase significantly his financial gifts to the society and its new building on Park Avenue.         Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the Asia Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and of the Japan Society's Gallery Advisory Committee. From 1974 to 1980, she was a member of the National Council on the Humanities and served on the New York State Council on the Arts. She was a member of the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other leading cultural institutions.         She is survived by a son, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, and three daughters, Sandra Ferry of Massachusetts, Hope Aldrich of New Mexico, and Alida R. Messinger of Minnesota.         A memorial service will be held at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Friday at 11 A.M. The family requests contributions be made to the Museum of Modern Art.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Georgia L. McMurray, a leader in developing services for children in New York City, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 58.         A quadriplegic, she had been suffering from a progressive nervous disease, said the Rev. Gerald L. Wagner, a friend.         Ms. McMurray was a former Commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development and deputy general director for programming of the Community Service Society of New York.         She was teaching as a professor at Fordham University's School of Social Work at the time of her death. She was also the president of a consulting firm, the GLM Group, which provides research, training, technical assistance and other management services to governmental and nonprofit organizations concerned with programs for children and families.         Her many honors included the Essence Award this year, given to her by Essence, a magazine for black women. This year, too, the Children's Aid Society cited her for distinguished service.         Ms. McMurray managed to continue her work even though her own disabilities forced her to walk on crutches.         Ms. McMurray was a graduate of Temple University and held a master's degree in social services from Bryn Mawr College. She came to public attention 22 years ago as the founder of Project Teen Aid for pregnant adolescents, which still exists.         The Lindsay administration tapped her in 1969 to develop services for young children and families as director of an Early Childhood Task Force. Two years later she became the first head of the child-development agency, an umbrella for the city's child-care and preschool programs not handled by the Board of Education. Under her guidance the number of day-care centers multiplied and the number of children served rose from 5,000 to 40,000.         She worked at the Community Service Society from 1978 to 1986, producing reports on homelessness and the changing demographics of urban poverty, and developing model programs for children and youths.         Ms. McMurray is survived by her mother, Daisy Fulen, and two sisters, Caroline Johnson and Narvine Fulen, all of Philadelphia.       
         Marilyn Neufeld Bergner, a professor and researcher who helped to develop a widely used system for evaluating the medical condition of patients, died Dec. 12 at her home in Silver Spring, Md.. She was 59.         She died of ovarian cancer, her family said.
