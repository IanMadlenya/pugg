         Barbara E. Brooks, an editor at three major women's magazines, died yesterday at her sister's home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 39 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lymphoma, said the sister, Suzanne Steinau.         For the last four years Ms. Brooks was the home director of Family Circle, where she was in charge of the magazine's decorating, remodeling, gardening and crafts coverage.         In a project to adapt housing to the needs of modern working women, she and an architect and a builder -- both women -- created what they called the Busy Woman's Dream House, with a design that was streamlined to minimize housework and maintenance. The project was displayed at the National Association of Home Builders' show in Atlanta in 1990.         That same year Ms. Brooks's magazine work won an award from the International Home Furnishing Center.         She started her magazine career as an associate decorating editor at Mademoiselle. Later she was hired to edit major articles at House Beautiful. In 1980 she went to Family Circle, where she started as its decorating editor.         Ms. Brooks was born in Queens. She was a graduate of Boston University and earned a master's degree in fine arts from Sarah Lawrence.         Her sister is the only immediate survivor.       
         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Patricia Brooks Mann, a lyric soprano who helped fashion the modern standard for opera performers, died on Friday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 59.         She died of complications of multiple sclerosis, said her husband, Theodore D. Mann, the artistic director and co-founder of Circle in the Square Theater.         In an era when audiences and critics began demanding that opera performers display dramatic as well as musical talent, Ms. Brooks, who performed under her maiden name, arrived with a non-operatic training that fit the bill.         Her distinctive style drew on her earlier career in the theater and dance. Her opera performances won praise for her beauty, acting ability and graceful movements, as well as for her voice. Some classified her as a singing actress rather than an opera singer.         "The public was clamoring that opera performers had to look and act the part, not just sing it, and she was the new wave," said Beverly Sills, her famed contemporary at the New York City Opera. Command Performance         Ms. Brooks starred in numerous City Opera productions in the 1960's and 1970's, when she was in her 30's and 40's. She also sang with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and was a soloist at Carnegie and Alice Tully Halls, Covent Gardens in London and in concerts across the United States. She gave a White House command performance for President John F. Kennedy.         In an early review, Raymond Ericson of The New York Times wrote that as Gilda in "Rigoletto" in 1963, "Miss Brooks was attractive to both eye and ear, a musicianly artist and an intelligent actress." When she co-starred with Placido Domingo in "La Traviata" in 1966, Harold C. Schonberg's review praised her for "acting with a delicacy of detail rare in opera."         Her performances proved popular with audiences. An account of her appearance in "La Boheme" in 1961 said she "very nearly stopped the show." A review of "Tales of Hoffmann" in 1966 said she "brought down the house." And a report of her singing of Bellini with Marilyn Horne in 1971 said listeners were driven "into a frenzy." Studied Dance         Ms. Brooks was born in Manhattan. As a youngster she took lessons in music, ballet and acting and at the age of 10 won a WQXR-radio piano competition. She attended the High School of Music and Art and at 14 began studying dance with Martha Graham.         But a knee injury from a fall turned her from dance to theater. She auditioned for Mr. Mann, who was smitten and confided to his partner, Jose Quintero, that he intended to marry the aspiring actress.         Mr. Quintero cast her in Truman Capote's "The Grass Harp" and in "The Iceman Cometh," with Jason Robards and Peter Falk, and she studied acting under Uta Hagen.         Ms. Brooks began folk singing and appearing in musicals, encouraged by her mother, Eda, a voice coach. While singing in the chorus of nuns in "The Sound of Music" in 1960, Ms. Brooks decided to leave that Broadway hit and switch to opera.         Maturing rapidly in her new medium, she won an enviable array of praise. Critics hailed her performances as charming, bewitching and dazzling. Her voice was described as sweet, velvety, free-floating, delicate, warm and rich. Her acting was called nuanced, subtle, sensitive, elegant, expressive and exciting.         Although it was undisclosed, eventually multiple sclerosis limited her breathing, so she retired from performing in 1977. But she began teaching voice and directing productions at the State University of New York at Purchase and gave private lessons for several years.         When illness forced an end to her teaching, she turned her creative energies to oil and water-color painting.         Besides her husband and mother, Ms. Brooks is survived by two sons, Jonathan and Andrew, both of Manhattan and Mount Kisco; a stepbrother, Alan Brooks, and a sister, Joan Brooks Palermo, both of Manhattan.         A memorial service will be held at noon on Feb. 1 at Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway at 50th Street.       
         Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a prominent welfare expert and former government official whose criticisms of the welfare system provoked stormy policy debates, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece.         Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is in fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.         "Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."         Her pronouncements often stirred opposition from other officials, experts and advocates. Some accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people and minorities, which she denied.         Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring cheaters and ineligible recipients from welfare and reducing erroneous overpayments. High-Ranking Welfare Posts         In 1978-79 she headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed and praised her as "terrific."         But during her term more than 100,000 people were pared from the welfare rolls. After she came under fire from a number of black officials, Mr. Koch named a deputy with superseding power over her, and she resigned. The Mayor's action was widely interpreted as a concession to soothe his frayed minority relations.         Dr. Bernstein also served as the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance from 1975-77, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.         Later she recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."         An economist, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.         Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health care, welfare spending, family budgets and prenatal care. Director at New School         Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."         On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.         After retiring from the New School, she remained in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.         Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at Columbia.         Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.       
         Kay Swift, who wrote the music for the popular standards "Can't We Be Friends?," "Fine and Dandy" and "Can This Be Love?," died yesterday at the Alzheimer's Resource Center in Southington, Conn. She was 95.         She died of Alzheimer's disease, which was diagnosed three years ago, said a granddaughter, Katharine Weber.         Two of her most famous songs were written for the 1930 hit musical "Fine and Dandy," which had lyrics by Paul James (the pen name of her husband, James Paul Warburg, a banker) and was the first Broadway show for which all the music was composed by a woman. "Can't We Be Friends?" was introduced in 1929 in the hit revue "The Little Show," where it was sung by Libby Holman to Clifton Webb.         Miss Swift was romantically involved with George Gershwin in the 1930's, and she and Warburg divorced in 1935. Years later, Miss Swift was an invaluable resource to Gershwin scholars because she could fill in gaps in manuscripts and remember how Gershwin played his music.         Katharine Faulkner Swift was born on April 19, 1897, in New York City, where she grew up and studied piano, composition and orchestration. After playing in a classical trio, she was a rehearsal pianist for the 1927 show "A Connecticut Yankee." Two years later, she cracked Broadway as a composer with "Can't We Be Friends?" In 1930, "Fine and Dandy," opened on Broadway, where it ran for 236 performances.         When the choreographer George Balanchine came to the United States, Miss Swift wrote the music for his ballet "Alma Mater," a 1935 spoof of the Harvard-Yale football game. She was director of light music at the 1939 World's Fair, the same year she married Faye Hubbard, a rodeo cowboy. The marriage, which ended in 1947, was celebrated in her chatty 1943 memoir, "Who Could Ask for Anything More?," which was made into the movie "Never a Dull Moment," with Irene Dunne and Fred MacMurray.         A third marriage, to Hunter Galloway, a radio announcer, also ended in divorce.         Miss Swift also contributed songs to "The Garrick Gaieties" (1930) and wrote most of the score for "Paris '90," a one-woman revue for Cornelia Otis Skinner, in 1952. A song cycle for her grandchildren, "Reaching for the Brass Ring," was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1953. She also wrote songs for Radio City Music Hall revues, pieces for three world's fair exhibitions and commemorations for several national organizations, including the Camp Fire Girls and the American Medical Association.         Miss Swift made her last public appearance in 1986 at Merkin Concert Hall in Manhattan.         She is survived by two daughters, April Gagliano of Rome and Andrea Kaufman of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.       
         Anna Goldfeder, a leader in cancer and radiobiology science who conducted research for 66 years, died on Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Goldfeder, whose career spanned generations of cancer researchers, made important contributions in her field until her retirement in 1988, when she was 91.         Her honors included an award from the Radiological Society of North America and the presidential gold medal from New York Academy of Sciences. She published an estimated 200 reports in journals.         Legendary for her work habits, Dr. Goldfeder routinely went to her laboratory seven days a week and put in 12-hour shifts. Opera was one of her few diversions. Her philosophy: "Either you keep swimming, or you sink to the bottom." 'The Mystery of Life'         When she first learned about cells as a student, she recalled, she was struck that "this was the mystery of life itself." She saw cancer as a special challenge and said she felt "humiliated" as a researcher when friends died of the disease.         Dr. Goldfeder bred a strain of albino mice whose lack of naturally occurring tumors made them ideal for cancer experiments by researchers around the world. The strain was named X-GF, the GF standing for her last name.         She was a pioneer in growing human breast cancer cells in cultures, researching radiation treatment and the effectiveness of different dosages and showing the importance of lead shielding of normal tissues during radiation.         Most of her career was at the New York City Hospitals Department, where she was the director of cancer and radiological research, with academic affiliations at New York University. She also worked at Harvard and Columbia Universities, Lenox Hill Hospital, Rockefeller Institute and the University of Vienna. Her work was sponsored by grants and money from her own pocket.         In 1977, the city closed Delafield Hospital where she worked. Nevertheless, the diminutive Dr. Goldfeder, 5 feet 2 inches tall, still strode through the deserted hallways to her lab and its colony of mice.         Born in Poland, Dr. Goldfeder earned a doctorate in science at the University of Prague in 1923. In 1922, while completing her degree, she started working at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Her research drew an invitation to the United States, and she immigrated in 1931.         Dr. Goldfeder, who lost most of her family in the Holocaust, had no immediate survivors.       
         Grace Hayward Mack, a horticulturalist known for her work in hybridizing chrysanthemums, died on Friday at her home in New Canaan, Conn. She was 91 years old.         Her family said the cause of death was heart failure.         Mrs. Mack became interested in hybridizing chrysanthemums as a hobby in the early 1950's. When she retired six years ago, she held patents on more than 35 varieties.         In 1968, Mrs. Mack, together with Rachel Carson, the author of "Silent Spring," received the Garden Club of America Award of Merit in Horticulture, the highest such award given in this country. In 1989, she was awarded the Gold Medal Award by the Society of American Florists for her outstanding contributions to the floral Industry.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Vassar College in 1924. Interested in social work, she first worked with Indian communities in Alaska, then held an executive post at the Y.W.C.A. in Duluth, Minn. Later she joined the Katherine Gibbs School in New York City, becoming director of placement.         She is survived by two sons, Talbot, of The Plains, Va., and John, of Washington; a daughter, Lucy, of Brookline, Mass., and six grandchildren.       
         Sally A. Provence, professor emeritus in the Child Study Center and the Pediatrics Department at Yale University, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 76 and lived at Branford.         The cause was cancer, said Dr. Albert J. Solnit, a longtime colleague.         For 35 years, Dr. Provence was director of the center's Child Development Unit. She retired in 1986. A pioneer in child development, both as a teacher and researcher, she documented young children's suffering and recovery from deprivation and trauma.         A founder and past president of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs, she received many honors, including the C. Anderson Aldrich Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics.         Born in Wills Point, Tex., she graduated from the Baylor University College of Medicine. Among her many publications, she is best known for her book "Working with Disadvantaged Parents and Their Children" (Yale University Press, 1983).         She is survived by her companion and co-worker, Audrey Naylor of Branford, and a sister, Ada Belle Banta of Wills Point.       
         Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.         "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."         Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.  Advocate of an Early Start         "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.         Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."         After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.         Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."         Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.         Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.         "I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."         Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.         Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."         Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.         Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.         At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.         When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway. She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith         In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.         That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.         He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.         That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.         In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit. One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts         Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.         During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.         Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.         First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.         "In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."         Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.  Propaganda Films For World War I         During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.         Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.         In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.         Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.         The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."         "Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."         With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."         In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.         Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad. From the Silents To the Talkies         Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.         Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.         As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."         Correction:  March 2, 1993, Tuesday         A picture in some copies yesterday with an obituary of Lillian Gish, showing a scene from "Life With Father," was published in error. It showed Dorothy Gish.       
         Ruby Keeler, the innocent-faced tap-dancing sweetheart of nine Warner Brothers musicals in the 1930's, died yesterday morning at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 82 years old.         The cause of death was cancer, said her daughter Kathleen Lowe.         In seven of those musicals, including "42d Street," "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," Miss Keeler was teamed with Dick Powell, and they became one of the most popular screen couples of the early 1930's. Among the songs she introduced were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo," "42d Street," "Honeymoon Hotel," "She's a Latin From Manhattan" and "Too Marvelous for Words."  A Comeback at 60         In 1971, 30 years after she had retired from show business, Miss Keeler starred on Broadway in a revival of the 1925 musical "No, No, Nanette." The show, which ran for 871 performances, was among the season's surprise hits and won warm critical notices for its star, whose return to show business at the age of 60 was hailed one of the most remarkable show business comebacks in years.         Miss Keeler was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Aug. 25, 1910, and moved to New York City with her family when she was 4. At the age of 13, after receiving three months of dance instruction, she got her first job in the chorus of the George M. Cohan show "The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly." For the next three years she worked in New York nightclubs, and in 1926, she was discovered at a dance contest by Earl Lindsay, a stage director who cast her in the Broadway revue "Bye, Bye, Bonnie."         At her next Broadway appearance, in the musical "Lucky," she was spotted by Florenz Ziegfeld, who offered her a role in the musical "Whoopee," starring Eddie Cantor. But before rehearsals began, she went to Los Angeles for a brief stage engagement. There she met Al Jolson, whom she married in 1928. Although signed to star in the Ziegfeld extravaganza "Show Girl," she dropped out of the show during tryouts to join Jolson on the West Coast. Five years later she made her film debut in the movie musical "42d Street."         In the film, which is regarded as the quintessential backstage musical, Miss Keeler played Peggy Sawyer, a smiling young member of the chorus line who takes over for the leading lady on opening night, saves the show, and finds happiness with Billy Lawler (Mr. Powell). Among the numbers she sang were "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" and the title song. Busby Berkeley's Style         The film introduced the elaborately choreographed routines of Busby Berkeley in which dozens of toe-tapping, high-kicking dancers were arranged in fantastic kaleidoscopic designs. After its success, the same formula was applied to "Gold Diggers of 1933" and "Footlight Parade," which also teamed Miss Keeler with Powell, and again had choreography by Berkeley and songs by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.         Miss Keeler went on to star in six more films for Warners before leaving the studio at Jolson's insistence. The films included "Dames" and "Flirtation Walk" (both 1934), "Go Into Your Dance" (her only film with Jolson) and "Shipmates Forever" (both 1935), "Colleen" (1936) and "Ready, Willing and Able" (1937).         "Mother Carey's Chickens" (1938), under a new contract with RKO, was a failure. She made her last film, "Sweetheart of the Campus," in 1941.         In 1940, her marriage to Jolson ended, and she retained custody of their 5-year-old adopted son, Al Jr. The next year, she married John Homer Lowe, a real estate broker in Pasadena, Calif., and retired. They had three daughters and a son.  An Association Spokeswoman         Shortly after her husband's death in 1969, the producer Harry Rigby called Miss Keeler and invited her to return to Broadway in "No, No, Nanette." Her name had been suggested, he said, by Berkeley, the show's production supervisor, who was then 74. Miss Keeler ended up staying with the show for its full two-year run and then touring with it for two more years.         In 1974, Miss Keeler had a brain aneurysm. She later became spokeswoman for the National Stroke Association, which established the Ruby Keeler Fellowship Memorial.         In addition to her daughter Ms. Lowe and her son Al Jolson Jr., she is survived by another son, John Lowe Jr., and two other daughters, Theresa Hall and Christine Pratt.       
         Claire Huchet Bishop, an author of popular children's books and a leading opponent of anti-Semitism, died on Thursday at her home in Paris at the age of 94. She had resided in Manhattan for about 50 years.         The cause of death was a hemorrhage of the aorta, said Mira Felner, a friend.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop began her career following in the footsteps of her grandfather and mother, noted storytellers in her hometown of Le Havre, France. She carried on that tradition in Paris and the United States, then began transcribing her stories. Many Translations         Her resulting books, which won several prizes, have appeared in a dozen languages, and some continue to be reprinted. Two were made into films. Her first book, "The Five Chinese Brothers" (Coward), is being translated to Spanish, 55 years after its original publication.         The persecution of Jewish friends in France in World War II prompted the second theme of Mrs. Huchet Bishop's life. She began writing for children and adults on spiritual issues and became an advocate in efforts for religious and racial harmony.         A Catholic, she was credited with helping win the deletion of anti-Semitic passages from the catechism with her analysis, "How Catholics Look at Jews" (Paulist Press, 1974). In a delegation visiting the Pope in the 1980's, she encouraged formal Vatican recognition of Israel.         She also served as the president of the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1975-77 and of the Jewish-Christian-Fellowship of France from 1968 to 1981.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop was born in Geneva. As a young woman, she discontinued her studies at the Sorbonne to devote more time to storytelling. In 1924 she opened France's first library for children, L'Heure Joyeuse (The Joyous Hour), and served as its director for five years.         She married Frank Bishop, an American concert pianist, and moved to the United States. She was in charge of the children's reading room at the New York Public Library in the mid-1930's and was the children's book editor of Commonweal.         After retelling a fable about Chinese quintuplets with superhuman powers, she decided to write down her version. That led to its publication and her career as an author of about 30 books. Two were runners-up for the Maybery Award, the highest honor for children's books, and she won other awards and citations.         Often her books had serious themes. "Pancakes-Paris" (Viking, 1947) was about food scarcity in wartime France. "Twenty and Ten" (Viking, 1952) told the true story of Christian French youngsters who hid their Jewish playmates from the Nazis. Wonderworks made it into a film, "Miracle at Moreau," for PBS television.         Her husband died in 1944.       
         Masha Tumarkin, who helped institute a new technique for teaching English to upwards of 50,000 recent immigrants in New York City, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 49 and was a Manhattan resident.         The cause of death was leukemia, her family said.         For several years she was the director of the English program for the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that aids in resettlement. She employed a system by which students start speaking in English within 12 weeks, when conventional methods often take many months longer. She supervised development of texts and curriculum and teacher retraining.         The concept, developed by her predecessor, Ira Goetz, features a fast-paced, question-and-answer format in which the teacher moves about the classroom from one student to another.         Born in Manhattan to Russian immigrants, Ms. Tumarkin grew up in a bilingual home with relatives and neighbors speaking in accents. After graduating from Columbia, she earned a master's at New York University in teaching English as a second language. She taught English at City College before joining the association in 1980.         Her marriage to Ethan Gologor ended in a divorce that drew publicity for a custody accord in which the children shuttled between the mother's and father's homes on alternating days.         Her survivors include her husband of a year, Richard Girard; two sons, Matthew Gologor of Oberlin, Ohio, and Benjamin Gologor of Manhattan; her mother, Suzanne Tumarkin of Manhattan, and a sister, Nina Tumarkin of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Margaret M. Mills, a former executive director of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, died on Sunday in an automobile accident in Naples, Fla., Hugo Weisgall, the academy's president, announced. She was 71.         Ms. Mills was born in England and later moved with her family to Brazil, where she studied animal husbandry and managed her father's cattle farm and eucalyptus plantation in a mountain town above Rio de Janeiro. She later worked in the Brazilian consulate in London and was transferred to the Brazilian Treasury in New York City.         She was employed by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1968, became the academy's executive director in 1973 and retired in 1989.       
         Jean Murray Branscombe, who helped develop one of New York City's first vest-pocket parks and was an aide to Laurence A. Rockefeller, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She was the executive director and later chairwoman of the Greenacre Foundation, founded by Abby Rockefeller Mauze. It developed Greenacre Park, an enclave with lush plants and a 25-foot-high waterfall on the north side of 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues in Manhattan.         The foundation also helped preserve and enhance other open spaces in Fort Tryon, Battery Park, Bryant Park and Union Square.         She also worked as an assistant to Eliot Richardson, later Attorney General in the Nixon Administration, when he was a lawyer in Boston, and was an assistant to Nelson A. Rockefeller in New York City and Washington.         She is survived by her husband, Robert F. Branscombe, a retired textile manufacturing executive; two sons: Peter, of Fairfield, Conn., and John, of Manhattan, and a sister, Betty Omohundro of Ponte Vedra, Fla.       
         Dr. Alice Ettinger, who helped to bring new X-ray techniques to diagnose gastrointestinal illness to the United States and taught radiology for five decades at the Tufts University School of Medicine, died on April 14 at the Norwood Retirement and Nursing Home in Norwood, Mass. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her nephew, Michael Roemer.         Dr. Ettinger was a highly regarded teacher who developed the first radiology residency program at Tufts and practiced at the New England Medical Center in Boston for nearly 40 years.         Alice Ettinger was born in Berlin on Oct. 8, 1899, four years after Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered the X-ray. She received her medical degree from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany, in 1924 and went on to a residency at the Charite Hospital of Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. She received intensive training in radiology from Dr. Hans Heinrich Berg, a pioneer in X-rays of the stomach and intestines. A 1932 Trip Is Crucial         At the time, radiologists had a device, the fluoroscope, that used X-rays to cast an image of the bowel on a screen. But it did not leave a permanent record, and Dr. Berg designed and built a machine, the spot-film device, that captured the fluoroscopic image on film so it could be studied later.         When Tufts asked Dr. Berg for the new device, he sent Dr. Ettinger off in 1932 with the machine in her luggage. Her arrival helped to launch modern gastrointestinal radiology in this country.         She joined the faculty at Tufts that year and remained for the rest of her career. She became clinical professor of radiology in 1950 and was chairwoman of the radiology department from 1959 to 1965, when she became professor emeritus. In 1939 she was made roentgenologist-in-chief at the Boston Dispensary and the New England Medical Center Hospital, and in 1965 she became senior radiologist at the medical center.         She continued as a clinician and teacher at Tufts until 1970, when at age 71 she became a consultant and director of student teaching, overseeing the radiology teaching program at the medical school until 1985 and teaching an elective course. For at least 13 consecutive years, she received the faculty teaching award from the graduating class at Tufts.         Dr. Ettinger's efforts also led to one of the earliest formal training programs for X-ray technologists, at Northeastern University. Among the awards she received was the Gold Medal of the American College of Radiology.         In addition to Mr. Roemer, of Yonkers, she is survived by a niece, Marianne Shoopak of Sunnyvale, Calif.       
         Patricia Peardon, the actress who created the central role in "Junior Miss" on Broadway, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her daughter Christine Noel Cameron of Manhattan.         Miss Peardon grew up in Allendale, N.J., and first began acting at the age of 8 on such radio programs as "Cavalcade of America" and "March of Time."  A Sassy Teen-Ager         In 1941, when she was 17, she made her Broadway debut at the Lyceum Theater in the hit comedy "Junior Miss," after having been discovered in an audition by the play's director, Moss Hart. Miss Peardon originated the role of Judy Graves, a sassy but frequently muddled adolescent.         Miss Peardon "is acting the central part of the younger sister like an inspired bear cub," said Brooks Atkinson in his review in The New York Times.         While starring in the play, Miss Peardon appeared on the cover of Life on Dec. 11, 1941, the week after Pearl Harbor was bombed; it was too late for the magazine's editors to change the cover.         In the early 1950's she acted in the television series "Johnny Jupiter," and in 1955, on Broadway, she played the spitfire younger daughter in the Tony Award-winning play "The Desperate Hours," acting with Paul Newman and Karl Malden.         In the 1950's and 60's, Miss Peardon toured with Arnold Moss's Shakespeare Festival Players in "The Tempest," "Measure for Measure," "Twelfth Night," "King Lear" and "Love's Labour's Lost," and performed in the 1960's at the American Festival Theater at Stratford, Conn.  As a Sculptor         In 1966, she began exhibiting and selling cast bronze sculptures, which were displayed three times in the windows at Tiffany & Company in Manhattan. Her work was also shown at many galleries, at Tufts University, and at the Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall.         Miss Peardon was married three times: to Peter Kalischer, a broadcast journalist; to Peter Brandt Harmon, a writer, and to Richard Horner, a producer. The marriages ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Cameron, she is survived by another daughter, Anne Cameron of Albuquerque, N.M., and a grandson, Alexander Cameron Little.       
         Nancy Quinn, the artistic director of Young Playwrights, an award-winning program dedicated to developing the talents of young writers, died on Saturday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 46.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sheri M. Goldhirsch, the managing director of Young Playwrights.         Ms. Quinn was born in Salinas, Calif. She grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., and graduated from Finch College in Manhattan. She began her career as an assistant to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Charles Gordone during the production of "No Place to Be Somebody" at the Public Theater.         For the next 25 years, she worked with other young playwrights, first as coordinator of the National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill Center in Waterford, Conn.,, then as associate producer at Arena Stage in Washington.         Ms. Quinn joined Young Playwrights in 1987. As producing director, then artistic director, she oversaw the group's annual Young Playwrights Festival. Under her guidance, submissions for the Festival, which features the work of three to five young playwrights each year, have increased from 600 entries a year to almost 950 this year.         Ms. Quinn also developed programs to reach into New York City's poorer neighborhoods. One, "Take a Grown-Up to the Theater," gives free tickets to students and lets them take an adult along. Another, the Young Playwrights Tour, takes plays to schools and youth centers throughout New York City.         At her death, Ms. Quinn had been working with Helios Productions to develop a series of "Schoolbreak Specials" written by Young Playwrights Festival alumni for CBS television.         She is survived by her husband, Paul King; her mother, Kathleen Quinn of Larchmont; a sister, Patricia Quinn of Los Angeles, and a brother, Michael, also of Los Angeles.       
         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Marian Anderson, whose velvety contralto and dignified, affecting stage manner melted the hearts of music lovers around the world, and whose determination helped shatter racial barriers in the arts, died yesterday in Portland, Ore. She was 96.         She died at the home of her nephew, the conductor James DePreist. Lee Walter, a friend of the singer, gave the cause as congestive heart failure a month after a stroke.         Miss Anderson's achievements, which inspired generations of young black performers, included a concert before 75,000 listeners at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 arranged by Eleanor Roosevelt after the Daughters of the American Revolution denied the singer the use of the concert hall in their national headquarters. And when she made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1955, she became the first black singer to perform there.         The soprano Leontyne Price, one of the first artists to benefit from Miss Anderson's efforts, said yesterday, "Her example of professionalism, uncompromising standards, overcoming obstacles, persistence, resiliency and undaunted spirit inspired me to believe that I could achieve goals that otherwise would have been unthought of."         In 1989, when a group of musicians that included Isaac Stern, Jessye Norman and Julius Rudel put together a concert to raise money for the Marian Anderson Award, a prize given to young singers as an honor to its namesake, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times, "Miss Anderson's place as a high priestess of American musicians, whatever their color, is not to be denied." Bigotry on a Daily Level         But Miss Anderson had to fight hard to win her place in American music history. Although she won first prize in a voice contest in New York in 1925 and made an appearance that year with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, she was unable to find operatic engagements, and within a few years her career came to a standstill. It was only after she toured Europe to great acclaim in the early 1930's that the American public began to pay attention to her.         Even after her artistry was recognized in her homeland, she faced racial prejudice on a more mundane level. Well into her career, she was turned away at restaurants and hotels. Even America's opera houses remained closed to her until Rudolf Bing invited her to sing at the Met near the end of her career.         Because opera was denied her for most of her career, Miss Anderson's reputation rests on the considerable communicative power that she brought to the recital stage. Her manner -- closed eyes, very few gestures -- conveyed stateliness and inner serenity. And her repertory covered considerable ground, from Bach and Handel oratorio selections to Schubert, Brahms, Schumann and Rachmaninoff songs, Verdi arias and spirituals.         Her recordings of standard concert works, most notably Schubert's "Ave Maria," were prized for the radiant beauty of her interpretations. But one of her real achievements was in emphasizing that spirituals deserved a place in the active repertory, something she demonstrated with sublime readings of "My Lord, What a Morning" and "Crucifixion," which were the centerpieces of many programs.  Sang at Age 3         "They are my own music," she once said. "But it is not for that reason that I love to sing them. I love them because they are truly spiritual in quality; they give forth the aura of faith, simplicity, humility and hope."         During her career, Miss Anderson gave her date of birth as Feb. 17, 1902, but June Goodman, a longtime friend of hers, said that while going through some family papers recently, she found Miss Anderson's birth certificate, which gave the date as Feb. 27, 1897. Miss Anderson was born in Philadelphia, the oldest of three children. Her father died when she was a child, and her mother took in laundry to support the family. She began singing when she was 3 years old; when she was 6 she joined the choir at the Union Baptist Church and impressed the director by learning all the parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- in the hymns the choir sang.         She did not have her first formal lessons until she was 15 and began studying with Mary S. Patterson. Her church choir raised money to pay for her lessons, and the Philadelphia Choral Society, a black ensemble, gave a benefit performance to support further studies with Agnes Reifsnyder and Giuseppe Boghetti.         In 1925, Mr. Boghetti entered his pupil in a New York Philharmonic voice competition, in which she competed with 300 singers and won first prize. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic on Aug. 27, 1925, and was immediately signed by a concert manager. But after a Town Hall recital and a handful of concerts, her engagements dwindled. By 1930, she decided to go to Europe, not only in search of performance opportunities, but in the hope of perfecting her command of languages and devoting further study to the art of lieder singing.         Her performances in Europe were great successes. During a Scandinavian tour in 1930 she met the composer Jean Sibelius, who spoke glowingly of her voice and dedicated the song "Solitude" to her. And when she ended a 1935 tour in Salzburg, Arturo Toscanini told her, "A voice like yours is heard once in a hundred years."  Persuaded to Return         The impresario Sol Hurok heard Miss Anderson sing in Paris that same year, and offered to present her in another Town Hall recital. She had misgivings, having received so much more enthusiastic a reception in Europe than in the United States. But Mr. Hurok persuaded her, and he remained her manager for the rest of her career.         Miss Anderson's return to Town Hall on Dec. 30, 1935, was the success that Hurok told her it would be. "Let it be said from the outset," Howard Taubman wrote in The Times, "Marian Anderson has returned to her native land one of the great singers of our time."         In the late 1930's, she gave about 70 recitals a year in the United States. But her fame did not entirely eradicate the prejudice she confronted as a young black singer touring the United States. It was a particularly unfortunate display of that prejudice, however, that helped make Miss Anderson a household name. In 1939, Hurok tried to book her at Constitution Hall in the national headquarters of the D.A.R., and was told that all dates were taken.         When Hurok took his singer's case to the public, Eleanor Roosevelt, the First Lady, resigned from the D.A.R., and other prominent women followed suit. Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, offered Miss Anderson the Lincoln Memorial for a concert on Easter Sunday 1939. Some 75,000 people attended the concert, and millions more listened to the radio broadcast. Photographs and films of Miss Anderson singing in front of Lincoln's statue, before the enormous crowd, quickly became a poignant symbol for the nascent civil rights movement.  Noncombative Personality         During the dispute, Miss Anderson maintained the quiet dignity for which she was famous. Refusing to comment or to express any rancor when reporters pressed her for a response, she later wrote in "My Lord, What a Morning," her memoir, "I particularly did not want to say anything about the D.A.R. As I have made clear, I did not feel that I was designed for hand-to-hand combat."         Four years later, the D.A.R. invited Miss Anderson to take part in a China Relief concert at Constitution Hall. "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall," she said later, "I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there."         Miss Anderson continued to tour as a recitalist, but made no headway in the opera world until Mr. Bing invited her to sing Ulrica in Verdi's "Ballo in Maschera." She made her debut on Jan. 7, 1955.         "The curtain rose on the second scene," Miss Anderson said later about the evening, "and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot."         It did not matter that at 57 she was past her vocal prime. As Howard Taubman noted in his review in The Times, "men as well as women were dabbing at their eyes" during the tumultuous ovation. Toured for State Department         In 1957, the State Department sponsored a 10-week tour of India and the Far East in which Miss Anderson sang 24 concerts in 14 countries. A CBS News crew accompanied her, and the film was used in "The Lady From Philadelphia," a program in Edward R. Murrow's "See It Now" series.         She sang at President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration in 1957, and at President John F. Kennedy's in 1961, and later that year for American troops in Berlin. She toured Australia for the first time in 1962, and in October 1964 began her farewell tour, at Constitution Hall, and gave her last recital at Carnegie Hall on April 18, 1965. She made occasional stage appearances in the 1970's, as the reader in Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait."         Late in her life Miss Anderson was frequently honored. She was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and in 1978 was in the first group of artists to receive Kennedy Center Honors. In 1980, the United States Treasury Department coined a half-ounce gold commemorative medal with her likeness, and in 1984 she was the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Arts Medal.         Miss Anderson married Orpheus H. Fisher, an architect, in 1943; he died in 1986. They had no children. The singer spent her retirement at her farm, which she named Marianna, in Danbury, Conn., and although in her last years she had to use a wheelchair, she was occasionally seen at concerts in New York City. In July 1992 she moved to Portland to live with her nephew, Mr. DePreist, who is her only survivor.         In the late 1950's, when Miss Anderson began to wind down her singing career, she pursued several other interests. President Eisenhower appointed her an alternative representative in the United States delegation to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. She gave benefit concerts for the Congress of Racial Equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. And she sang again at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.         She also made a point of helping young singers, particularly through the Marian Anderson Awards, which she started when the city of Philadelphia awarded her the $10,000 Bok Prize in 1943. Eventually the prize fund ran out of money, but since its re-establishment in 1990 it dispenses $25,000 annually. She was also associated with Young Audiences, an organization that presents school concerts with professional musicians.         In addition to direct involvement and encouragement, she was also, of course, a role model for the black musicians who followed her.         "At age 10 I heard, for the first time, the singing of Marian Anderson on a recording," the soprano Jessye Norman once said. "I listened, thinking, 'This can't be just a voice, so rich and beautiful.' It was a revelation. And I wept."       
         Raphaelle Jeanne Semmes, a senior civil servant who became executive director of the Bush Administration's Commission on Environmental Quality, died Tuesday at the Washington Home Hospice. She was 46 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, said her sister Walden S. Morton.         Miss Semmes went into Government service in 1970 as a supervisor in the Department of Transportation. She served as executive secretary of the Peace Corps from 1982 to 1989.         In the fall of 1991 she was named executive director of the new panel set up to advise President George Bush on ways to protect the environment without excessive cost.         Miss Semmes was born in New Orleans. She graduated from George Washington University and received a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         Her marriage to Robert Taylor of Washington ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, Walden, of Center Harbor, N.H., she is survived by a son, Raphael James Taylor; her parents, Vice Adm. Benedict J. Semmes, retired, and Katherine Ainsworth Semmes of Washington; another sister, Amy Semmes Waite of Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, Dr. B. J. Semmes of Chevy Chase, Md.       
         Mary Duncan Sanford, a philanthropist and society grande dame for many years, died Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98 and also had residences in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Locust Valley, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died in her sleep.         Mrs. Sanford reigned over Palm Beach society for half a century. She was a founder of the Polo Ball and was active in many charities, including the American Cancer Society, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.         In New York City, Mrs. Sanford was the longtime national chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball Committee, which raised money for several charities, including the Leukemia Society of America and the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.         She arrived in Palm Beach in 1933, newly wed to Stephen Sanford, an international polo star and a director of the Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Company Inc.  He died in 1977.         In Palm Beach, they lived in a mansion, Los Incas, near the winter home of Rose Kennedy, who became Mrs. Sanford's close friend. The Sanfords regularly entertained a wide variety of notables, including the King and Queen of Jordan and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         Mrs. Sanford was a native of Richmond. She attended Cornell University for a year but dropped out to become an actress. She had an early success in the lead role in "Shanghai Gesture" at the Martin Beck Theater on Broadway.         She later went to Hollywood, where she co-starred with Marion Davies in "Five and Ten." Miss Davies introduced her to Mr. Sanfordafter a polo match in Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Sanford is survived by a niece, A. Maxine Warner of Alexandria, Va., and a grandniece.       
         Julia Knickerbocker, a leader in the field of book publicity, died on Sunday at the Robert Janker Clinic in Bonn. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after fighting cancer for two years, said her sister, Miranda de Kay.         A longtime public relations executive in book publishing, Ms. Knickerbocker influenced a whole generation of young public relations executives who now hold significant positions in various houses. She was known for her elegance, wit and style.         At her death, she was vice president and director of media relations at Bantam Books in New York. There she worked with authors such as Robert Pirsig, whose "Lila" (1991) became a major best seller.         "She was that rare publicist equally adept at getting attention for literary, serious kiss-and-tell and pop entertainment novels," said Stuart Applebaum, vice president of publicity and public relations at Bantam Doubleday Dell.         Much of her career was with Simon & Schuster, where she began in 1974 as a senior publicist and rose to be associate publisher. For more than a decade as director of publicity, she was the driving force behind all of Simon & Schuster's campaigns, working with such best-selling authors as Jackie Collins and Jane Fonda.         She began her career at M. Evans & Company in 1967 and later headed the publicity department at William Morrow & Company.         She was born in Paris, where her father, H. R. Knickerbocker, was a correspondent for United Press. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1958.         Her marriage to Charles La Muniere ended in divorce.         Besides her sister Mrs. de Kay, she is survived by another sister, Suzanne Colt, and two daughters, Noelle La Muniere McElroy Carter and Suzanne La Muniere, all of Manhattan.       
         Joan Sperry Rader, who was active for two decades in the Republican Party in Connecticut, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, William Donald Rader.         Mrs. Rader, who had lived in Greenwich since 1965, was a real-estate broker and longtime school trustee. She was elected in 1989 to a two-year term as the vice chairwoman of the Republican State Central Committee of Connecticut, becoming its highest-ranking female officer. She was re-elected to a second, successive term and held the office at the time of her death.         Her many volunteer activities over the years included serving as a trustee of the Eagle Hill School in Greenwich, a private day and boarding school for learning-disabled children and teen-agers. A Brooklyn Native         Since 1981 she had been a real-estate broker with Douglas, Elliman Pickering Associates in Greenwich.         Mrs. Rader was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Edward G. Sperry, who was for some years president of the Sperry Products Company, which manufactured railroad and subway track-testing equipment and other products in Connecticut and on Long Island, and the former Mary Elizabeth Garvin, who was a company director.         She grew up in Oyster Bay, L.I., and graduated in 1956 from Vassar College, where she majored in economics. In 1958 she married Mr. Rader.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Rader is survived by three daughters, Judith Anne, of Boston, Jennifer Caroline, of Springfield, Ohio, and Elizabeth Rader Edwards of Riverside, Conn.; two sisters, Judith Sperry Beavers of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Joy Sperry Emery of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and a granddaughter.       
         Penelope Gilliatt, a writer of fiction, journalism and screenplays, and a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 61.         She had been in poor health for some time.         Ms. Gilliatt (pronounced with a hard G) was best known for the film criticism she wrote from 1968 to 1979 for The New Yorker, where she shared reviewing duties with Pauline Kael, and for her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," a 1971 film starring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch.         Her short stories were marked by precision, compression and a gift for conveying a dramatic situation through dialogue. Anthony Burgess, reviewing her short-story collection "Nobody's Business" for The New York Times Book Review in 1971, wrote: "She is intelligent, economical, poignant, highly contemporary. She is also innovative."         Ms. Gilliatt, whose maiden name was Penelope Conner, was born in London. Her father, a barrister and later a judge, worked as a director of the BBC. After attending Queen's College, a private school, she came to the United States to enter Bennington College in Vermont on a scholarship. She dropped out during her first year. "I thought I should get on with life, and I'd run out of money," she later said in a newspaper interview. A Contest Winner         A brief period working for the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York ended when she won a short-story contest sponsored by British Vogue. She returned to London to join the magazine's staff, eventually becoming its features editor. She also contributed freelance articles to The Spectator and New Statesman.         From 1961 to 1967, Ms. Gilliatt served as film critic and, for one year, drama critic of The Observer in London. In 1968 she joined The New Yorker, where, in addition to reviewing film, she contributed many short stories and profiles.         Her first novel, "One by One" (1965), about a menage a trois, contained the seeds of her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," about a London couple, a man and a woman, in love with the same man. The screenplay, which was widely praised for its sensitive, literate treatment of a potentially exploitative subject, was nominated for an Academy Award.  The National Society of Film Critics named it the best screenplay of the year, and the New York film critics, in a tie vote, named her co-winner for best screenplay with Larry McMurtry, for "The Last Picture Show.         Ms. Gilliatt left The New Yorker in 1979 on an extended leave of absence after writing a profile on the novelist Graham Greene whose accuracy was challenged by Greene. A novelist, Michael Mewshaw, also complained to the magazine that material in the article had been taken, without credit, from an artcile he had written on Greene for The Nation. At the time, Ms. Gilliatt said that Mr. Greene's charges were a subtle form of practical joke. She continued to contribute short stories to the magazine and in recent years wrote profiles of John Cleese and Jonathan Miller. Known for Her Stories         Although Ms. Gilliatt wrote five novels, including "A State of Change" (1968) and "The Cutting Edge" (1979), she was best known for her stories, collected in "Come Back if It Doesn't Get Better" (1969), "Nobody's Business" (1972), "Splendid Lives" (1978), "Quotations From Other Lives" (1982) and "They Sleep Without Dreaming" (1985).         Ms. Gilliatt's New Yorker film criticism and profiles were collected in "Unholy Fools" (1973) and "Three-Quarter Face" (1980). Her last book was "To Wit: Skin and Bones of Comedy" (1990), a collection of essays.         Both her marriages, to Roger Gilliatt, a neurosurgeon, and the playwright John Osborne ended in divorce.         She is survived by a sister, Angela Conner of London, and a daughter, Nolan Osborne Parker of East Sussex.       
         Bernice Feinstein, a former lecturer on music history at George Washington University, died on Sunday at King Edward VII Hospital in Bermuda. She was 67 and lived in McLean, Va.         She was stricken during a vacation and died after heart surgery, said her son John, who lives in Bethesda, Md. She was in Bermuda with her family to celebrate her 40 years of marriage to Martin Feinstein, general director of the Washington Opera.         A native of Manhattan, the former Bernice Richman graduated from Smith College and earned a master's degree in music from Barnard College and a doctorate in music from Columbia University.         Her association with George Washington University began after her husband, a former vice president of Sol Hurok Concerts in New York, was named executive director of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. From 1976 until two years ago, she taught courses on the history of Western music and opera history.         In addition to her husband and son John, Mrs. Feinstein is survived by another son, Robert, and a daughter, Margaret, both of McLean, and a brother, Peter Richman of Lexington, Mass.       
         Eunice Saunders Carroll, an employee of Sotheby's for 40 years and the director of its Special Client Services Department, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 73.         A Sotheby's associate said the cause was pneumonia.         During her years with Sotheby's, herpurchases for auction sales totaled well into the billions of dollars, including the Duchess of Windsor's jewels and the collections of Greta Garbo, Florence Gould and Andy Warhol.         Mrs. Carroll was born in North Carolina and taught English for several years before becoming a paymaster in the Navy during World War II. She later came to New York and took a job as a bookkeeper at Parke-Bernet Galleries, Sotheby's predecessor in the United States. After the two merged, she became a vice president and, in 1978, a senior vice president.         She was among the early in-house bidders -- Sotheby's representatives who initiate telephone bids for major art collectors who do not want to appear on the auction floor.         She is survived by her son, James Carroll of Greenfield, Mass; her daughter, Nedda Carroll of High Falls, N.Y.; her niece, Cynthia Leigh Young of New York City; three sisters, Inez Alexakos of Stafford, Va., Jeanette Lucas of Crofton, Md., and Josephine Lee of Lake Katrine, N.Y., and her brother, Eriel Saunders of Willow Springs, N.C.       
         R. Louise McManus, a leader in nursing education who spent 36 years on the faculty of Teachers College of Columbia University, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Natick, Mass. She was 97 and had lived in Manhattan before retiring to Massachusetts.         Her death came after a brief illness, the college reported.         On the faculty since 1925, Professor McManus served as director of the Division of Nursing Education at Teachers College from 1947 until her retirement in 1961. At the college she founded the Institute of Research and Service in Nursing Education.         Professor McManus was a native of North Smithfield, R.I.         She was a past chairman of the nursing council of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation. Teachers College named its Nursing Education Alumni Medal after her in 1964.         Professor McManus is survived by four daughters, Joan Lawrence of Natick, Madeline Frankenhauser of Falmouth, Mass., Catherine Myers of Wilmington, Del., and Anna McThaden of Seattle; 23 grandchildren, 37 great-grandchildren, and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Patricia Stanton McLean, a retired educator and leader in the dental-hygienist profession, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.         The cause of death was heart disease, her family said.         Ms. McLean retired in 1977 as the director of Columbia University's Division of Dental Hygiene and an assistant dean at Columbia's School of Dental and Oral Surgery. She was a former president of the American Dental Hygienists Association.         Under a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, she developed the nation's first curriculum for dental-hygiene educators and administrators. She was also an author of "Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist."         She was a past chairwoman of the Council of Auxiliaries of the American Association of Dental Schools, president of the Dental Hygienists Association of New York City and an executive board member of the Dental Hygienists Association of New York State. Daughter of Dentist         She was also a consultant to the National Institute of Health and the American Fund for Dental Health.         Ms. McLean, the daughter of a dentist, was born in Buffalo. She earned her certificate in dental hygiene at Columbia, a bachelor's degree in health education at New York University and a master's in administration at Columbia.         After entering private practice and teaching dental hygiene in Tuckahoe, N.J., public schools, she returned to Columbia as an instructor. She was promoted to director of its dental hygiene division in 1964.         She was separated from John McLean, a dentist. He died in 1983.         She is survived by a daughter, Marianne Doran of Pleasantville; three sons, John, of Fort Collins, Colo., Peter of Solebury, Pa., and Paul, of Fresno, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Arleen Auger, an American soprano who was renowned for both her commanding presence on the opera stage and the subtlety of her song interpretations, died on Thursday at the home of a friend in Leusden, a suberb of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. She was 53 and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Mary Lou Falcone, Miss Auger's publicity agent, said the cause was brain cancer.         Miss Auger's most famous performance was her appearance at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, on July 23, 1986. She sang Mozart's "Exsultate, Jubilate" as part of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, which was televised globally and seen by some 500 million people.  Debut in Vienna         Mozart was always at the core of her repertory. Miss Auger (pronounced awe-ZHAY) had exactly the right flexibility, coloring and vocal weight for Mozart opera roles and concert works, and they were the vehicles with which she had her biggest successes. She made her operatic debut as the Queen of the Night in a 1967 Vienna State Opera production of "Die Zauberflote." Nine years later she made her New York debut in the same role at the New York City Opera. Among her recent recordings are highly praised portrayals of Donna Anna in "Don Giovanni" and the Countess in "Le Nozze di Figaro."         She also won great acclaim for her performances of Bach, Handel and Haydn, and although she did not eschew the use of vibrato, as other early-music singers did, she was considered a supremely stylish interpreter of that repertory. Still, she resolutely resisted being typecast. She constantly expanded her repertory, and applied her rich tone and her thoughtful sense of line to everything from Schubert and Schumann lieder and turn-of-the-century French art songs to works by Weill, Berg and Schoenberg. Libby Larsen and Judith Zaimont were among the composers from whom she commissioned new song cycles.         "I sing Bach, Mozart, contemporary music and everything in between," she wrote in an article for Keynote in 1985. "If it's for my voice and my voice can do it well, I'm happy to do it."         But Miss Auger was a late bloomer, musically: she did not begin studying voice until she was out of college and working as an elementary-school teacher in Chicago. And when she auditioned for the Vienna State Opera, she knew only one role, the Queen of the Night.  Taught Elementary Schoolers         Arleen Auger was born in South Gate, Calif., on Sept. 13, 1939. She studied the piano and violin briefly as a child and sang in community choirs, but she later told interviewers that she had had very little exposure to classical music when she was growing up. She attended California State University at Long Beach, where she earned a degree in education in 1963. For the next four years, she taught elementary school in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.         The world of opera and art song opened for her in 1965, when she was teaching in Chicago and began studying voice with Ralph Errolle. She apparently progressed quickly; two years later, when she was teaching first grade in Los Angeles, she won first prize in the I. Victor Fuchs Competition. The prize included a trip to Vienna to audition for the Volksoper. Her audition repertory included three pieces: the two Queen of the Night arias and Olympia's aria from Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann."         As it turned out, the soprano Lucia Popp had just withdrawn from a production of "Zauberflote" at the Vienna State Opera. That company's director, Josef Krips, heard Miss Auger's audition at the smaller Volksoper, and offered her a contract. When she joined the company, she later said, she knew only the one role, had no stage experience and did not speak German. She made her debut without a rehearsal, and had to ask other singers where to go as she was pushed out on stage.  Sought Expanded Repertory         But she prospered in Vienna. During her first two years she added a dozen roles to her repertory, and she remained with the company until 1974, when she began to find the State Opera's repertory expectations too constricting. When she left the company she began singing more frequently at other European houses, including La Scala. She also expanded her recital repertory and took a teaching position at the Academy of Music and Drama in Frankfurt, where she taught until 1987.         She had by then become intent on regulating the pace of her career. She refused to sing roles if she did not consider herself ready for them, sometimes alienating conductors whose invitations she declined. But she said later that those decisions saved her voice and prolonged her career.         By the early 1980's, Miss Auger's European career was thriving, though her concert and opera appearances in the United States had been relatively few. She had cemented her reputation as an early-music singer at the Oregon Bach Festival, directed by Helmuth Rilling (with whom she recorded more than 50 Bach cantatas) and at the New England Bach Festival. But at the time, American listeners knew her mostly through what was already a vast discography.         Miss Auger began to cultivate an American following seriously in January 1984, when she sang Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Strauss songs at her New York debut recital at Alice Tully Hall. Reviewing that concert in The New York Times, Donal Henahan praised the clarity of her tone and her sensitivity to musical and textual nuances. "Although pure lyricism is obviously Miss Auger's strong point, there is more to her than that," he wrote, adding that she "is a singing actress of some depth." Explored the Nuances         Thereafter, Miss Auger performed more frequently in the United States, and her recitals were high points of the concert season for fans of art song. Statuesque and attractive, she was a compelling and elegant stage personality who invariably gave the impression of having thoroughly explored both the overt emotional resonance and the underlying psychological nuances of the songs on her programs. She continued performing until last season, when her illness forced her to cancel touring plans and recording projects.         Miss Auger made nearly 200 recordings, documenting a vast repertory that ranged from her Bach, Mozart and Handel specialties to a series of both standard and offbeat opera and song projects. Many of her recordings won international awards, including the Grand Prix du Disque, the Edison Prize and the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis.         She is survived by her parents, Everett and Doris Auger, and a brother, Ralph Auger of Healdsburg, Calif. SELECTED RECORDINGS         Arleen Auger's recordings document her talents as opera singer, recitalist and soloist in oratorios and symphonic choral works. These are some of her recordings, all on compact disk.         Brahms: A German Requiem (Telarc)         Canteloube: Songs of the Auvergne (Virgin)         Handel: "Orlando" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Messiah" (Archiv)         Handel and Bach Arias (Delos)         Mendelssohn: A Midsummer Night's Dream (Philips)         Monteverdi: "L'Incoronazione di Poppea" (Virgin)         Mozart: "Le Nozze di Figaro" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Lucio Silla" (Philips)         Mozart/Strauss/Wolf: Lieder (Sony Classical)         Strauss: Four Last Songs (Telarc)         Wolf: Lieder (Hyperion)         "Love Songs": works by Copland, Britten, Strauss, Schumann, Gounod, Mahler, Foster, others (Delos)       
         Genevieve Millet Landau, former editor in chief of Parents magazine and an expert in child development, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Landau joined the staff of Parents in 1957, becoming editor in chief in 1970. She resigned from the magazine in 1978 to create the Hasbro Center for Child Development and Education, a nonprofit arm of the Hasbro Toy Company.         She served as editorial director of the Dell Magazine Group from 1981 until she retired in 1987. She later worked as a volunteer for the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization that helps former convicts.         She graduated in 1954 from Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Besides numerous articles, she was the author of a book, "The Gift of Play," (Walker & Company, 1980), with Maria W. Piers.         Survivors include her husband, Sidney; two daughters, Elizabeth Millet of Manhattan and Jessica Rosenberg of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Gloria E. Wise, who led a sit-in at a lunch counter in the South in 1960 and became a New York City social work administrator and head of a popular youth program, died on June 7 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 56 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         For her life's work in promoting racial and ethnic harmony, Mrs. Wise won the John V. Lindsay prize from the Citizens' Committee for New York City earlier this year. She donated the $5,000 award to her Youth Activities Committee, which sponsors after-school and summer programs.         As the student government president of Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., Mrs. Wise joined four male students in protesting the whites-only rule at the local Woolworth lunch counter in 1960. She was among the first black women to demonstrate.         "Everybody was afraid, because we didn't know what was going to happen," she recalled. "But we did it because we wanted to be able sit down at a lunch counter."         Mrs. Wise was a city social worker for 31 years and became the director of case management resources at the Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx.         She retired there last year to devote full-time to her volunteer job as the executive director of the youth committee, which she helped found 17 years ago. It has served more than 20,000 youngsters from Co-op City and its neighborhood with education, recreation, culture and career programs.         Mrs. Wise was born in Manhattan. After graduating from Bennett she earned a master's degree in social work at Columbia University. She was a trustee of the Bronx Trinity United Methodist Church.         She was married to Leroy Wise, who is dead.         Surviving are her parents, Clarise and William E. Brown Sr., of the Bronx; three brothers, William Jr., of the Bronx, and Donald and Rodney, both of Atlanta, and two sisters, Juanita Garrido, of Goose Creek, S.C., and Diane Brown, of the Bronx.       
         Dr. Barbara Whitney, an expert in sex education and a leader in the battle against AIDS in New York City's public schools, died on Friday at a friend's home on Squam Lake, N.H. She was 56 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         For the last two years, Dr. Whitney worked in the School Chancellor's office as director of the H.I.V./AIDS Technical Assistance Project, a privately financed program that teaches AIDS prevention throughout the school system. 20 Years in the Field         Dr. Whitney spent the last 20 years as a trainer, educator and administrator in the field of human sexuality. From 1978 to 1985 she was executive director of Siecus, the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, in New York City. She was director of health services for the Children's Aid Society and director of the AIDS Training Institute in the New York City Department of Health.         Dr. Whitney, a native of Iowa, graduated summa cum laude from the College of Nursing at the State University of Iowa and earned a master's degree at Boston University's School of Nursing. While pursing her career, she studied psychoeducation at Temple University and not-for-profit management at Columbia University's School of Business. She received a Ph.D. in 1988 from the human-sexuality program in the Department of Health Education at New York University, which entailed studies in Sweden, Japan and Kenya.         Dr. Whitney is survived by her mother, Azalea Boeke of Sun City, Ariz.; a sister, Janice Hayes of Bloomington, Ind., and two daughters, Jennifer Whitney of Port Townsend, Wash., and Katie Whitney of Philadelphia.       
         Halina Rodzinski, who worked for Polish charities and wrote "Our Two Lives," a memoir about her husband, the conductor Artur Rodzinski, died on Tuesday at her summer home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was chronic leukemia, said her son, Richard.         Mrs. Rodzinski was born in Warsaw. In 1934, she married Rodzinski and went with him to Cleveland, where he was music director of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Mrs. Rodzinski was active in several Polish charitable and cultural organizations, including Polish Mutual Assistance, founded in 1956 to help Poles in the United States who had been left destitute by World War II. From 1959 until her death she was president of the Committee for the Blind of Poland.         She was also a founding member and honorary chairman of the Harlem School of the Arts and for many years was on the advisory board of Young Concert Artists.         Mrs. Rodzinski's 1976 memoir, "Our Two Lives," received critical praise for its vivid portrayal of her husband as an autocratic, temperamental genius who conducted with a baton in his right hand and a loaded revolver in his hip pocket. Mr. Rodzinski, who died in 1958, was music director of the New York Philharmonic from 1943 to 1948.         In May, Mrs. Rodzinski was awarded Poland's highest civilian honor, the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit.         In addition to her son, who is the executive director of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, she is survived by a sister, Aniela Mieczyslawska of London, and a grandchild.       
         Mary Ellen Forbes Kramer, who led the campaign to preserve and redevelop the historic mill district in Paterson, N.J., died on Monday at a hospital in Norwalk, Conn. She was 56 and lived in Little Falls, N.J., and Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kramer became active in civic affairs as the wife of Paterson's Mayor for 14 years, Lawrence (Pat) Kramer. In her first major issue, she led the efforts that blocked state plans to build a highway that would have destroyed some old silk mills.         After that success, she became the executive director of the Great Falls Development Corporation and worked to preserve the mills, which were built in the early 1800's and used the water power of the 77-foot-high Great Falls. The buildings were adapted to new uses, including the Paterson Museum, offices and artists' residences.         In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford visited the district to proclaim its national landmark status, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave Mrs. Kramer an award. New Career at College         She started a new career in 1980 as the director of community affairs at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.         There she was instrumental in founding the Wayne Chamber Orchestra, creating the annual Legacy Awards to raise scholarship funds, collecting more than $300,000 to restore the Hobart Manor on campus and organizing a popular annual lecture series with speakers like Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, Alvin Toffler and Beverly Sills.         She also served on the boards of St. Joseph's Hospital and the Straight and Narrow drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, both in New Jersey.         Mrs. Kramer was born in Paterson. After graduating from Mary Washington College she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology from George Washington University and briefly practiced as a school psychologist. She was divorced.         Surviving are her companion, Irving Appleman; her mother, Catherine Forbes of Wyckoff, N.J.; a daughter, Patricia Kimberly Sposa of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Lawrence 3d, also known as Kip, and Patrick, also known as Kelly, both of Paterson; three brothers, Cyril Forbes of Montclair, N.J., William Forbes of Paterson and Paul Forbes of Morristown, N.J., and two sisters, Joan Forbes of Wyckoff and Nancy Braithwaite of Nassau, the Bahamas.       
         Ariel D. Rubstein, a soprano who performed throughout the United States and Europe, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 41.         The cause was AIDS, her family said.         Ms. Rubstein made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1988 as Barena in an acclaimed concert version of Janacek's "Jenufa" by the Opera Orchestra of New York. The performance, which starred Gabriela Benackova and Leonie Rysanek, was recorded live and released on compact disk.         Ms. Rubstein was born in Portland, Ore., to parents in the performing arts. Her father, also named Ariel, was a Russian-born pianist, the director of the Portland School of Music and a founder of the Portland Opera. Her mother, the former Eleanor Reed, was a stage actress.         As a student, Ms. Rubstein was encouraged by Rudolf Serkin to pursue music. She studied at the Juilliard School and won a scholarship for studies in Vienna.         Ms. Rubstein performed with the Opera Company of Boston, the Houston Grand Opera, the Portland Opera and other ensembles throughout the United States. She also sang with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the New Orleans Philharmonic and other orchestras in the United States.         She is survived by her father, of Portland; a brother, Peter, of Manhattan, and a sister, Victoria Pierson of Portland.       
         Caroline Klein Simon, who overcame early obstacles to women in the legal profession to become a pioneering female judge, politician, state official and champion of laws against discrimination in jobs and housing, died yesterday at home. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Judge Simon, who was still active as a lawyer at her death, served in state posts under appointments from both Republican and Democratic governors and was the first woman nominated by a major party for citywide office in New York City.         She helped draft the nation's first state law barring job discrimination and later led the nation in imposing regulations against racial "block busting" by real-estate brokers.         Judge Simon's credo was simple. "I am against discrimination in any form," she said.         During her own career, she faced discrimination from the very beginning.         She was rejected for admission to Columbia University's law school in the 1920's because it did not have toilets and other accommodations for female students, her family said. So she earned her law degree at New York University instead. Failed Search for Paying Job         After graduation, despite her strong academic record and passing the bar examination, she was turned down by every firm where she applied to become a law clerk. She finally offered to work free for a year "to convince them that a woman could be a lawyer," she later recalled.         Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst took her up and after the year was up she was offered a permanent job. But she decided instead to work for indigent clients and family planning groups.         Three decades later, she was a leading candidate to become the Postmaster of New York in 1958 but was vetoed by Federal officials. The New York Times reported, based on officials close to the Postmaster General, "Opposition to the appointment of Mrs. Caroline K. Simon was based on the ground that the job was unsuited to a woman."         In a widely quoted speech the next year, she said: "There are four things a woman needs to know. She needs to know how to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog." Worked Under Dewey         Her public service began in the 1930's when she was instrumental in changing state laws to entitle women to serve as jurors and was herself among the first called for service.         District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of Manhattan named her to a panel on revising the Domestic Relations Court Act. During World War II she served as the Office of Civilian Defense's director of group activities in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.         Mr. Dewey, by then Governor, appointed her to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board in 1944-45 and the temporary State War Council's Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1943-45.         Eager to continue the fight against discrimination, she helped draft the nation's first state law on job bias based on race, religion or nationality and became a founding member of the resulting State Commission Against Discrimination. City Council Race         In 1956, Gov. W. Averell Harriman, a Democrat, appointed her to the new State Youth Commission.         The next year she ran for City Council President as a Republican. Although she lost to Abe Stark by about two-to-one, she still ran some 100,000 votes ahead of her ticket and received the biggest total for a citywide Republican candidate.         In 1958 she served as the legal advisor to the American delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         In 1959 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, inducted her as New York's Secretary of State, the second woman to hold that post. It was in that role that she issued the nation's first regulations against block busting, in which brokers manipulated property owners' fears about racial or ethnic changes in the neighborhood to provoke sales.         It was her marriage to Leopold K. Simon, a lawyer, that ignited her interest in the law.         They divorced in the early 1950's. She remarried, to Irving W. Halpern, the chief probation officer of the Court of General Sessions, who died in 1966.         Her survivors include her son, Lee K., of Wilmington, N.C.; a daughter, Cathy Prince of White Plains; a brother, Nathan F. Klein of Titusville, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         A service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street in Manhattan.       
         Olive A. Beech, a leader in the aviation industry and a co-founder and chairwoman of the Beech Aircraft Company, died yesterday at her home in Wichita, Kan., at the age of 89, her family said.         Under her leadership, Beech Aircraft became a leading manufacturer of private airplanes for general aviation, including propeller, turbo-prop and jet planes. It also won missile and space contracts.         Mrs. Beech's career began by chance. As a young woman, she was hired in 1925 as the secretary to Walter Beech, the director of the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita. They later married.         In 1932 they formed their company as the Beechcraft company, with Mrs. Beech as the secretary-treasurer. While her husband was a talented designer of planes, she emerged as the hard-driving supervisor and shrewd manager of the corporate finances.         When Mr. Beech suffered encephalitis in 1940, she took full command and retained much of that control even after he returned to work.         Upon his death in 1950, she took over as president and chairwoman. She gave up the presidency in 1968 and remained as chairwoman until 1982, then became chairwoman emeritus.         The company grew from having a handful of employees to a payroll of more than 10,000 and annual sales exceeding $900 million.         The Raytheon Company bought Beech Aircraft in 1980, and she was elected to the parent company's board and executive committee.         Mrs. Beech was a past president of the Women's International Association of Aeronautics and a leader in other aviation organizations. She was appointed to national boards by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon.         Fortune magazine twice named her as one of the top 10 women in business in the 1970's. She was awarded the aviation industry's Wright Brothers Trophy and was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame. She was also active in many charitable organizations.         Mrs. Beech was born on a farm in Waverly, Kan., and grew up in Paola, Kan. She displayed her budding managerial talent at the age of 11 when she took over some of the family's financial chores, including paying its bills. She was educated at the American Secretarial and Business College in Wichita.         Surviving are two daughters, Suzanne Beech Warner of Boulder City, Nev., and Mary Lynn Oliver of Wichita, and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Kaplan, who devoted her life to helping retarded children and making the public aware of their needs, died on Wednesday at Central General Hospital in Plainview, L.I. A resident of Old Westbury, she was 82.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Kaplan was a founder and charter member of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, Nassau County Chapter. She served as its secretary, vice president and president, and finally, from 1961 until 1988, as its executive director. After that, she continued to attend functions and maintained an active interest in the organization until her death.         In the late 1940's retarded children had few opportunities in education, training or recreation. This led to the birth of the association in New York City in 1949. News quickly spread to Long Island and the Nassau chapter sprang up the same year. Son Died of Leukemia         Mrs. Kaplan's first child, David, was retarded, and died of leukemia at the age of 9 in 1952, two years after she opened the fledgling association's first day camp for 24 children. In 1950 she started a demonstration training program, which she ran for eight years.         She became the guiding force behind the growth of the Nassau Association for the Help of Retarded Children, whose more than 8,000 members support educational, vocational, residential and other programs to serve 1,400 children and adults and their families. She spent 11 years as a full-time volunteer until the death of her husband, Allan, in 1960, when she joined the salaried staff.         The New York association now has chapters in nearly every county and sister organizations across the country. The statewide group, Nysarc Inc., belongs to the Arc of the United States.         Mrs. Kaplan grew up in Philadelphia. She graduated from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and was an accomplished pianist.         She sat on several influential committees and received many honors. Among them was the first Helen Award, created by a State Commissioner of Mental Health, Alan Miller, and named after her.         Mrs. Kaplan is survived by another son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Leona Dubnick, coordinator of the gifted-education program for the Huntington, L.I., public schools until her retirement in 1985, died on her 65th birthday Friday at the Williamsburg (Va.) Community Hospital. She lived in Huntington and Pound Ridge, N.Y., until moving to Williamsburg less than two years ago.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Dubnick graduated from Brooklyn College, earned an M.A. at City College and studied for a doctorate at Teachers College of Columbia University. She joined the Huntington school system as a teacher and designed, developed and administered its gifted-education curriculum and program.         In the late 1970's she also created and broadcast "Ask the Teacher" radio programs at the Long Island station WGSM and at WVOX in Westchester. From 1988 to 1991 she was public-relations director, news editor and writer at WPOB-FM in Plainview-Old Bethpage, L.I.         Mrs. Dubnick is survived by her husband of 43 years, Dr. Lester Dubnick; her daughter, Monica L. Mowery of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a sister, Stella Monchick of West Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Florence Baker Martineau, long active in the New York Heart Association and other charitable organizations, died yesterday in Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Martineau had been visiting a friend in Washington, Conn., when she entered the hospital. The cause of her death was complications from bronchial pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Martineau was a supporter of the Muscular Dystrophy Research Fund at Children's Hospital in Boston.         Born in Manhattan, she was a daughter of George F. Baker Jr., a banker, and the former Edith Brevoort Kane. She was a granddaughter of George F. Baker, a director of 43 banks and corporations. Mrs. Martineau graduated from what is now called the Hewitt School and Sarah Lawrence College.  She lived in Washington, Conn., before moving to Palm Beach nine years ago.         Her marriage in 1932 to Thomas Suffern Tailer, a sportsman, ended in divorce. In 1941 she married Stanley Martineau, a sculptor whose works included a bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Mr. Martineau died in 1977.         Mrs. Martineau is survived by 2 daughters from her first marriage, Fern de Narvaez of Palm Beach and Wendy Holt of Cool, Calif.; a son from her second marriage, Michael, of Granville, Mass.; 9 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Lucinda Ballard, the Broadway costume designer, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Miss Ballard won the first Tony Award for costume design, in 1947, for her work on several productions in that season: "Happy Birthday," "Another Part of the Forest," "Street Scene," "John Loves Mary" and "The Chocolate Soldier." She won another Tony in 1962 for "The Gay Life."         In 1945, she won a Donaldson Award, a prestigious theatrical prize that is no longer given, for the nostalgic costumes she designed for "I Remember Mama." In 1951, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the film "A Streetcar Named Desire." Correcting an Omission         Miss Ballard was an energetic champion of the costume designer's importance to a play. She was known for her skillful use of color, and Elia Kazan also noted her talent for visualizing in advance how the costumes in a play would look together, when they were seen by the audience.         Writing in 1987 about Miss Ballard's role in the history of theatrical costume design, Jeanne T. Newlin, the curator of the Harvard Theater Collection of the Harvard College Library, said: "The costume designer waited far too long for full professional appreciation. No one in the modern American theater has done more to resist this omission and force open the eyes of the producer, the director and, best of all, the playwright than Lucinda Ballard."         Miss Ballard once described herself, with some understatement, as "a theatrical designer who was quite successful and was noticed, especially for making historical costumes look human rather than museumish."         Her first theater credits were as the scenic and costume designer for a 1937 production of Shakespeare's "As You Like It" at the Ritz Theater in New York. She retired in 1962, but came back in 1985 to design the costumes for a revival of Tennessee Williams's "Night of the Iguana." Born in New Orleans         Miss Ballard, whose given name was Lucinda Davis Goldsborough, was born in New Orleans, the daughter of Richard Goldsborough and the former Anna Farrar. She attended Miss McGehee's School in New Orleans and the Art Students League in New York. She also studied in Paris and elsewhere in France.         She married William F. R. Ballard in 1930; they were divorced in 1938. In 1951, she married Howard Dietz, who wrote the lyrics for more than 500 songs, and they lived for many years in Sands Point, L.I. He died in 1983.         Miss Ballard is survived by a son, Robert F. R. Ballard of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Liza Dietz Gard of London; six grandchildren, and two stepgrandchildren.       
         Dr. Wilma Thompson Donahue, an expert in the psychology of aging and director emeritus of the University of Michigan Institute of Gerontology, died on Tuesday at her home in Ann Arbor. She was 92.         She had had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Donahue was among the country's first clinical psychologists when she began her career at Ann Arbor in 1935 as a practitioner of the branch of psychology that deals with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of personality and behavior problems. Her reputation widened in the 1950's as her name appeared in journals and books on housing, medical care and other subjects concerning the elderly.         She served on state commissions on aging and was founding president of the Michigan Society of Gerontology. Ten years ago, she was in the first group inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         Nationally, Dr. Donahue took part in White House Conferences on Aging in 1961, 1971 and 1981 and was a member of related policy boards for Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. She served for 10 years as director of the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, a post she left 10 years ago.         Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, she earned three degrees in psychology at the University of Michigan, including a doctorate in 1937. She practiced at the mental hygiene clinic of the Student Health Service starting in 1935 and was appointed an instructor in the department of psychology three years later.         In 1951, she became the founding director of the university's division of gerontology and took the same position at the transformed Institute of Gerontology in 1966. She retired in 1970.         At the time, the university's Regents cited her ultimate mission as apolitical and purely educational: "She sought to elicit the truth about old people, especially those distressed in mind, body, or estate."         Dr. Donahue's husband, Lester, died in 1963 after 41 years of marriage.       
         Alison Raymond Lanier, who made a career of untangling the confusions that foreign posts might pose for American career women, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         She was the author of a series of books explaining the ways of overseas cultures. But since such exchanges are a two-way street, she also wrote books to help foreigners sort out the mysterious ways of American society.         Thus, her "Living in the U.S.A." (Scribner, 1973) was translated into half a dozen languages, including Arabic, Japanese and Chinese. Her last book, "The Rising Sun on Main Street: Working with the Japanese" (International Information Press, 1990), sought to help Americans puzzled by the customs of Japanese living among them.         Her 11 books included an "Update" series that went through several editions, most of them issued by her own company, Overseas Briefing Associates, and by Intercultural Press. They ranged from "Update -- Britain" to "Update -- Venezuela". Graduate of Bryn Mawr         Mrs. Lanier, a native of Manhattan, was a 1938 honors graduate of Bryn Mawr College, for which she did public-relations work in the early 1940's. In World War II, she served in the United States Navy Women's Reserve, retiring in 1946 as a commander.         In the 1950's she traveled widely as executive director of the foundation-supported Committee of Correspondence, which worked to make women into leaders in their countries' development. These experiences prompted her first book, "Half the World's People" (Apoleton-Century-Crofts, 1965). After that she directed hospitality programs at the United Nations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.         In 1967 she founded Overseas Briefing Associates. It provided seminars for corporations and organizations increasingly active overseas and ready to dispatch personnel into unfamiliar territory. The briefings went over the difficulties facing women, whose chances of foreign assignments were just opening up.         Two years ago she organized a volunteer service to help newcomers from the former Soviet bloc to tackle English and adjust to life in America.         Mrs. Lanier's husband, Albert G., died last September.         She is survived by a sister, Audrey McMahon of Lawrenceville, N.J., and a brother, Edward A. Raymond of North Branford, Conn.       
         Alice Wicks Olson, who received an apology from President Gerald R. Ford years after her husband committed suicide following a secret Government drug experiment, died last Thursday in Frederick, Md. She was 77.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Nils Olson, a son.         Mrs. Olson's husband, Dr. Frank R. Olson, died in 1953 when he jumped from a 10th-floor window of the old Hotel Statler in New York. After a 20-year campaign by Mrs. Olson, Federal investigators started an inquiry into the circumstances of Dr. Olson's death.         That inquiry forced the Central Intelligence Agency to acknowledge in 1975 that her husband, a civilian chemist for the Army, had been an unwitting participant in an experiment in which people were given varying doses of LSD to observe their reactions.         In addition to apologies from President Ford and the Director of Central Intelligence, the family was awarded $750,000 by Congress.         After the death of her husband, Mrs. Olson counseled alcoholics and drug addicts in Frederick. The Alice Olson House, a center for women recovering from drug and alcohol addition, was named in her honor.         In addition to Dr. Nils Olson of Frederick, she is survived by another son, Eric W. Olson of Stockholm, and three grandchildren.       
         Olivia L. Gilliam, a foundation executive, died on Sunday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 55 and also lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         For the last 20 years, Mrs. Gilliam was the executive director of the Myrin Institute, a foundation whose causes include international affairs, the environment and drug-abuse education through its offshoot, the American Council for Drug Research. Through Myrin, she was a founding editor and the artistic director of the Orion Society's Orion Nature Quarterly.         She worked with the Office of the Tibetan Mission to the United Nations in the 1960's. She also was active in the founding of Conservation International and served on the board of the New York Blood Center.         Surviving are her husband, Marion G. H. Gilliam; her mother, Natalie Davenport of Great Barrington and John's Island, Fla.; a sister, Baroness Bernard D'Anglejan-Chatillon of Paris and Vero Beach, Fla.; a half brother, William C. Ladd of Brewster, Mass.; a half sister, Cornelia Goode of Melbourne, Australia; two stepbrothers, Geoffrey and Eric DeBellaigue, both of London, and a stepsister, Cornelia Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H.       
         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Rosamond Cross, a retired head of the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died on Tuesday at the Waverly Heights retirement community in Gladwyne, Pa. She was 86.         The cause appeared to be heart failure, said Barbara Minsker, the school's director of alumnae relations.         Miss Cross became the headmistress of the girl's preparatory school, in the Philadelphia suburbs, in 1941, retiring in 1970.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and taught history at Concord Academy in Massachusetts and the Lincoln School in Providence, R.I. She began her teaching career at the Baldwin School in 1937. She was also a trustee of Mount Holyoke College and had been an advocate for the physically disabled.         Miss Cross is survived by two nieces and a nephew.       
         Susan K. Johnson, the senior vice president for account management at Mediamark Research Inc., a Manhattan-based media and market research company, died on Friday at the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. She was 46 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was meningitis, said her husband, Leonard Gelstein.         Ms. Johnson joined the company, which carries out research on subjects like magazine readership, in 1989. She was previously a vice president and associate media director of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., a Manhattan-based advertising agency.         At her death, she was also vice president of the Media Research Directors Association.         She was born in Wilmington, Del., graduated from Tower Hill School there and earned a B.A. in psychology from Vassar College in 1969.         In addition to her husband, whom she married in 1984, she is survived by their daughter, Megan Elizabeth Gelstein; her mother, Kathryn Johnson of Brooklyn; and a sister, Janet Grimminger of Townsend, Del.       
         Diana Vincent-Daviss, a professor of law and law librarian at Yale University Law School, died on Tuesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 50.         A spokeswoman for the university said she died of a cerebral aneurysm.         She was appointed law librarian at Yale in 1991 after serving in a similar capacity at New York University for eight years, during which she supervised the expansion of the law library, doubling its physical size.         She was known for her work on the preservation of library materials and was a consultant to more than a dozen law libraries, including libraries in Chile, which she assisted under a grant from the United States Agency for International Development.  Author of Handbooks         She was also involved in the promotion of international human rights and was recently named deputy director of the Orville H. Schell Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale. The center promotes research and assists lawyers and organizations concerned about preserving individual rights and freedoms and acts as a clearing house for information.         She was the author of many articles and handbooks, including a three-part research guide on human rights law that was published by New York University.         She was born in Birmingham, England. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in law at Cambridge and a master's degree in library science at Columbia University in 1972.         Her marriage to Stephen Elias ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Megan Elias of San Rafael, Calif., and two sisters, Elizabeth Christenfeld of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Lucy Vincent-Daviss of Evesham, England.       
         Jacobina Caro, a dancer, choreographer and acting coach, died on Sept. 13 at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 90.         The cause was a stroke, a family member said.         Ms. Caro coached actors and singers in the Los Angeles area until the last month of her life. She was born in Elizabeth, N.J., and worked in the 1940's as a choreographer for the Works Projects Administration. Her work included "Run, Little Chillun," which was performed nationwide. She also taught at the Actors' Laboratory in Los Angeles.         In the 50's, she was commissioned by Daytop, the drug and alcohol rehabiliation center in Manhattan, to create a theater piece called "The Concept." In 1968, a restaging of the piece, which relates the struggle of a young addict to give up drugs and renew his life, was acclaimed by critics and became an Off Broadway event.         Ms. Caro reworked the piece as the cultural director at Daytop. She said she restaged it to create a more realistic style in the performance and to inject a bit more humor. The theater profits went to assist Daytop.         She was the widow of Robert Meltzer, who died in World War II. A later marriage ended in divorce. Ms. Caro is survived by a daughter, Jo Victory Sadalla of Phoenix, and a grandson, Jed.       
         Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.         Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease.         Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.         Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation. W.P.A. History Project         While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.         Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.         She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.         In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.         Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Barbara Taylor Schoen, an author and the founder and director of the writing program at the State University of New York at Purchase, died on Thursday at her Purchase home. She was 69.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Schoen, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Bryn Mawr College, cum laude, and Boston University, where she earned a master's degree in physics. While pursuing a doctorate in physics at Boston, she worked on isotope analysis as a technician in the Department of Biophysics of Harvard Medical School.         While raising four children, she began a writing career in the 1950's and saw her short stories first published in Seventeen magazine. Over the years, she also contributed articles on education, personal computers and other subjects to various periodicals.         She was the author of two well-received novels for young readers, "A Place and A Time" (1967) and "A Spark of Joy" (1969), both published by Crowell.         Mrs. Schoen (rhymes with phone) became a teacher-counselor in 1970 at the Cooperative College in Mount Vernon, which was later merged into the College of Letters and Sciences at SUNY-Purchase. At Purchase she became an assistant professor of language arts in 1973 and an associate professor five years later.         A tenured faculty member, she was teaching nine undergraduate courses covering various aspects of writing from poetry to essays to fiction and science. She had been director of the college's Writing Program since 1984. As such she developed a series of courses and a set of creative-writing classes for literature majors hoping to write professionally.         Mrs. Schoen is survived by her husband of 47 years, Donald R.; two sons, Robert of Southport, Conn., and John of Riverside, Conn.; two daughters, Claire Werner of Norwalk, Conn., and Susan Terray of Woods Hole, Mass.; her mother, Caroline Colgate Taylor of Manhattan; a sister, Alice Day of Canberra, Australia; a brother, Howard C. Taylor 3d of Jericho, Vt., and six grandchildren.       
         Zita Johann, a stage and film actress who played Boris Karloff's love interest in "The Mummy," died on Friday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 89 and lived in Orangeburg, N.Y.         The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Rosemary Franck.         Miss Johann was born near Temesvar, Hungary, now Timisoara, Romania. She moved to New York City with her family when she was 7 and appeared in high school productions. After applying to the Theater Guild for work as an understudy, she immediately won roles in touring productions of "Peer Gynt," "The Devil's Disciple" and "He Who Gets Slapped."         She made her Broadway debut in 1924 in the Theater Guild's production of "Man and the Masses." Other leading roles followed, in "Machinal" (1928), "Tomorrow and Tomorrow" (1931) and other plays. To Hollywood and Back         In 1931 she played the wife of a steelworker who succumbs to drink in "The Struggle," the last film by D. W. Griffith. Most memorably, she played Helen Grosvenor in "The Mummy" (1932), whom the Mummy takes to be the vestal priestess for whom he conceived a forbidden passion 3,700 years earlier.         After appearing in "Tiger Shark" (1932), "Luxury Liner" (1933) and "Grand Canary" (1934), she returned to New York to act in the theater. She appeared in "Panic" (1935), "Flight Into China" (1939), "The Burning Deck" (1940) and "The Broken Journey" (1942).         During World War II, she raised money for war-related charities and organized shows for American soldiers on their way overseas. In recent decades, she worked with disturbed children and gave private acting lessons.         Her three marriages, to John Houseman, the director, John McCormick, an agent, and Bernard E. Shedd, an economist and publisher, all ended in divorce. She had no children.       
         Florence Small Gaynor, the first black woman to head a major teaching hospital in the United States, died on Sept. 16 at Christiana Medical Center in Newark, Del. She was 72.         She died unexpectedly after a sudden brain hemorrhage, said her son, Wardell.         Mrs. Gaynor, a registered nurse by training, rose through the ranks of administration at several large New York hospitals at a time when there were few women or blacks in such positions. In February 1971, she was chosen from a field of 20 candidates, the rest of them male, to be executive director of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, making her the first black woman ever to head one of the city's municipal hospitals.         Eighteen months later she accepted a job in New Jersey, as executive director of Martland Hospital in Newark, a 600-bed teaching hospital operated by the state's medical school. Now part of the the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, it was then the state's largest hospital. Struggle to Become Nurse         Born in Jersey City, the fourth of six girls, Mrs. Gaynor fought racial barriers from the time she graduated from high school, at the age of 15, to get training to become a nurse. The first nursing school where she applied, at Jersey City Medical Center, turned her down because it did not admit blacks.         She worked at a doll factory and at an electric plant to help support her family and then applied the nursing school at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. She graduated as a registered nurse in 1946 and worked first at Queens General Hospital.         After a stint as a public-health nurse in East Harlem for New York City's Health Department, she worked as head nurse at Francis Delafield Hospital in Washington Heights and as a school nurse with the Board of Education in Newark.         At the same time she was pursuing a bachelor's degree in nursing and then a master's degree in public health at New York University. She spent the summer of 1965 at the University of Oslo in Norway studying the Scandinavian health system.         When she returned, she pursued a career in hospital administration, starting in the pediatrics department of Lincoln Hospital, which is staffed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. After a series of promotions, she was named assistant administrator in 1970.         After heading Sydenham Hospital and Martland Hospital, she left the Northeast to serve from 1976 to 1980 as director of hospital and health services at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, a historically black school that has produced many of the nation's black doctors.         From 1980 until 1984, she was director of the West Philadelphia Community Mental Health Consortium in Philadelphia. For two years, before she retired in Wilmington, Del., she worked again as a school nurse, in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Wardell Michael Gaynor of Brooklyn and Matthew Small Gaynor of Cincinnati; a daughter, Brenda L. Gainer of Wilmington; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Thompson MacDonald, the founder of Recording for the Blind, a nonprofit organization that has put more than 80,000 books on tapes for blind and learning-disabled students since 1948, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Huntington, L.I. She was 96 and had lived in Manhattan.         She died in her sleep, said her daughter, Anne Thomas.         Mrs. MacDonald started the recording service while working for the Women's Auxiliary of the New York Public Library. She was inspired by a program that provided recordings for blind veterans attending college on the G.I. Bill of Rights.         She established a recording studio in a two-room office on West 44th Street in 1951 and became president of Recording for the Blind in 1952. That year, she persuaded friends to establish other studios in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Athens, Ga. Volunteer for Several Groups         The organization, now based in Princeton, N.J., has grown to 32 studios in 16 states, with about 4,000 volunteers making recordings of fiction and nonfiction books for students from the fifth grade to graduate school. Last year, about 33,000 people requested copies of the recordings.         Mrs. MacDonald began working as a volunteer for several organizations during World War II. She was appointed assistant director of the Nurses' Aide Corps of the American Red Cross in 1942 and later helped set up a program to house and feed British soldiers released from Japanese prison camps who stopped in New York on their way home.         In May 1988, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University for her volunteer work.         She was the wife of Ranald H. MacDonald, a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, who died in 1988.         She is survived by her son, Ranald H. Jr. of Denver; her daughter, Anne M. Thomas of Locust Valley, L.I.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Harriet L. Hardy, a pioneer in occupational medicine and the first woman to become a full professor at Harvard Medical School, died on Wednesday in Boston. She was 87.         Dr. Hardy died from lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system, at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where she had worked since 1940, hospital officials said.         Dr. Hardy set out to become a country doctor but developed an early interest in toxicology and environmentally related illness. Her investigation of respiratory illness among factory workers in Lynn and Salem, Mass., in the mid-1940's led to the discovery that they had come down with berylliosis, an often fatal disease caused by exposure to the light metal beryllium.         Berylliosis results from inhaling dust or fumes containing beryllium, but the symptoms may not emerge until 10 to 20 years after exposure to even a small amount of the metal. The disease, which develops in only a small percentage of people who are exposed, can produce coughing, shortness of breath, weight loss and scarring of the lungs. Created a Model Registry         Dr. Hardy set up a registry of beryllium illness that the hospital still maintains. The registry became a model for tracking other occupational hazards and establishing guidelines for their control.         In 1947, Dr. Hardy created an occupational medicine clinic at the hospital and remained its director until she retired in 1971. Dr. Hardy also led the occupational medical service at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge for more than 20 years and advised the institute on safety considerations relating to its first nuclear reactor. She also helped coordinate the study of industrial diseases at Dartmouth College.         Dr. Hardy was not the first woman appointed to the Harvard Medical School faculty but was its first full professor. That appointment did not come until the end of her career, in 1971, when she was made clinical professor of medicine.         Dr. Homayoun Kazemi, chief of pulmonary and critical care at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said Dr. Hardy was "very kind, yet bombastic, never hesitating to express her opinions."         "She spoke her mind, and there was no ambiguity about what she said," Dr. Kazemi said. Began as School Doctor         Harriet Louise Hardy was born in Arlington, Mass., on Sept. 23, 1905. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1928, received her medical degree from Cornell University in 1932, and went on to train as an intern and resident at Philadelphia General Hospital.         She began her career as school doctor at the Northfield School in western Massachusetts. In 1939, Dr. Hardy became college doctor and head of health education at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, where she developed an interest in women's growth and physical fitness.         Her lifelong interest in beryllium poisoning developed from her investigation of a mysterious respiratory illness that had occurred among workers making fluorescent lamps at the General Electric and Sylvania plants on Boston's north shore. Many of those affected were women.         At the time, Dr. Hardy was working on problems of lead poisoning with Dr. Joseph Aubt in Boston. He had been informed of the outbreak and told Dr. Hardy, "Something is happening in the factories, and they don't know what is going on." He encouraged her to investigate.         In linking the illness to beryllium, Dr. Hardy went back to work done in Russia and Germany in the 1920's and 1930's. Wrote a Standard Textbook         She described acute and chronic beryllium poisoning in papers in 1946 and 1947. About the same time, other groups described a similar illness among workers exposed to beryllium in Ohio.         The work of Dr. Hardy and others led to precautions that allowed safer use of beryllium.         Dr. Hardy worked with the Atomic Energy Commission in Los Alamos, N.M., to study hazards associated with nuclear energy. Beryllium is used in nuclear energy plants and the aerospace industry.         Dr. Hardy was a crusader against diseases caused by occupational exposure to dangerous substances. In 1954, she was among the first to link asbestos and cancer. She studied mercury poisoning and anthrax, a bacterial disease, among farm workers and was a pioneer in using drugs known as chelating agents to treat lead poisoning.         Dr. Hardy and Dr. Alice Hamilton, another occupational medicine pioneer, wrote a standard textbook on industrial toxicology. Dr. Hardy was the author of more than 100 scientific papers.         She is survived by four nephews.       
         Gertrude Marie Derrick Bolden DePass, the first black administrator of a New York City welfare center in Harlem and a former deputy director of the city's Bureau of Public Assistance, died on Oct. 8 in a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 86.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Mrs. DePass joined the Welfare Department in the early 1930's after graduating with honors from Hunter College. She was appointed director of the Harlem Welfare Center, which was at 1951 Park Avenue, in 1952, and in 1964 she was named deputy director of the Bureau of Public Assistance, a division of the Welfare Department, which later became the Human Resources Administration.         Her first husband, Theodore Roosevelt Bolden, died in 1968.         She is survived by her second husband, Hubert DePass of Orlando, Fla.; two daughters, Barbara Hurst and Jeanne Drysdale, both of Queens; two stepdaughters, Beverly Bressant of Orlando, Fla., and Claire Johnson of Queens; a stepson, Raymond DePass of Queens; nine grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-granddaughter.       
         Lois Kibbee, a stage actress, director and writer who became known late in life for her decadelong role as the matriarch Geraldine Whitney Saxon on the daytime television serial "The Edge of Night," died on Monday in Memorial Sloane-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a brain tumor, said a friend, Carrie Nye Cavett.         Miss Kibbee joined the CBS serial in 1970 and played the character of Geraldine intermittently until the show went off the air in December 1984. She received four Emmy nominations for best supporting actress on the show, and, as an "Edge of Night" associate writer, shared an Emmy nomination for outstanding writing in the show's 1981-1982 season. Miss Kibbee took on the role of Elizabeth Sanders on the ABC television serial "One Life to Live" in 1986.  A Veteran of the Stage         Born in Wheeling, W.Va., she began her acting career at the age of 5 in a road version of "Rip Van Winkle" while her parents were appearing in a stock-company production there.         In 1951 she founded the Civic Theater of El Paso and was its resident director for eight years. Before establishing herself in daytime television, Miss Kibbee had appeared in more than 350 stage productions around the country. She also appeared on Broadway in "A Man for All Seasons" and "Venus Is."         Eventually she became a radio actress in Hollywood, appearing on "Our Miss Brooks," "Sam Spade," "The Jack Benny Show" and "The Green Hornet." She also acted in the 1980 movie "Caddyshack" and in many other films.         Miss Kibbee was the author of two books: a 1967 biography of Christine Jorgensen and a 1970 biography of Joan Bennett, "The Bennett Playbill."         At the time of her death she was writing a biography of her family, which traces its theatrical roots back to Mississippi River showboats. Her mother, the actress Lois Wilson Kibbee, made her theatrical debut in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" on a river boat; her uncle was the actor Guy Kibbee.         She is survived by her mother, of Chino, Calif.; two brothers, Milne, of Chino and James, of New Orleans; and a sister, Elizabeth Zonn.       
         Audrey Triolo, an advocate for the elderly and poor in the Greenwich, Conn., area who directed a food bank and an organization that developed affordable housing, died on Oct. 14 at her home in Riverside, Conn. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         From 1987 to 1992 Mrs. Triolo was director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County, which supplied food to about 50 agencies in Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Darien and New Canaan. From 1983 to 1986, she was executive director of the Greenwich Housing Coalition, a nonprofit organization that built low-cost housing.         She had served in numerous humanitarian organizations since moving to the Greenwich area with her husband in 1967. In recognition of her volunteerism, Greenwich officials declared a day in her honor in the city on Sept. 20.         Mrs. Triolo was born in Minneapolis and graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1954.         She is survived by her husband, Peter; two sons, Stuart, of Seattle and Bruce, of Fort Collins, Colo.; two daughters, Ellen Uebele of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Leslie Franks of Portland, Ore., and six grandchildren.       
         Josephine Jablons, a board member of the New York City Opera Company, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69 and also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Jablons helped found the City Opera Guild in 1959 and for six years served as its president. She led it when the opera celebrated its new home at Lincoln Center with a lavish gala in 1966. She had been on the board of the City Opera since its days at City Center on West 55th Street. She was elected a director of the City Opera Company in July.         A native of Albany and a graduate of Skidmore College, Mrs. Jablons began her career in journalism and public relations. She spent 14 years as a reporter and editor of The New York Herald Tribune in Paris and in New York, covering travel, society, the arts and other subjects.         She also took part in Democratic Party affairs. She was active recently in several organizations helping immigrants.         She is survived by her husband, J. Mitchell Jablons; a daughter, Pamela Jablons of Manhattan; a son, Dr. David Jablons of San Francisco, and a sister, Grace Burke of Colonie, N.Y.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973. Mrs. Judge is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Judge Howes of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jeremy of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Shearer, a producer and director of documentary films about black Americans, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.         The cause was colon cancer, said her brother Clement.         Ms. Shearer's works included "A Minor Altercation" (1978), about the Boston school-busing crisis; "The Keys to the Kingdom" and "The Promised Land" (1989), which were in the civil-rights television series "Eyes on the Prize," and "The Colored 54th Regiment" (1991) for the PBS series "The American Experience."         Ms. Shearer was born in Boston and graduated from Brandeis University. She helped found Boston Newsreel, a documentary company, and worked at WCBN radio and WCVB television in Boston.         Besides her brother Clement, of Northfield, Minn., she is survived by her mother, Erline, of Boston; two sisters, Debbie, of Boston, and Linda Gossage, of San Francisco; and another brother, Charles, of Boston.       
         Joan Weidemann Harris, a retired Brooklyn community worker and former board member and executive director of the Y.W.C.A. of Brooklyn, died on Thursday at her home in Warren, Conn. She was 63 and also lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Harris was a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work. Over the years, she worked at the Maimonides Community Mental Health Center, the Mayor's Office for the Aging, community groups assisting the elderly and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In the 1980's she worked at the Private Industry Council.         During her years in Brooklyn she was active on community boards, including those of the Colony South Brooklyn Houses, the Brooklyn Heights Association and the Brooklyn Teen-age Pregnancy Network.         Mrs. Harris is survived by her husand of 40 years, James T.; a daughter, Karen H. Weidemann of Korsor, Denmark; a son, Christopher T. of Medford, Mass., and a grandson.       
         Alice Basto Tondel, coordinator of the Harvard University Band for 37 years, died on Thursday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 80 and a lifelong resident of Cambridge.         She died of respiratory failure, said Thomas Everett, the band's director.         Mrs. Tondel was an unpaid volunteer who traveled on road trips with the band, edited its Bass Drum Journal and offered counsel to students. The band will pay tribute to Mrs. Tondel today before the start of the Harvard-Penn game at Harvard Stadium.         Mrs. Tondel graduated from Wheelock College in Boston and was an artist in the Boston area for many years, maintaining a graphic arts business.         She is survived by a son, Mark Tondel of Lee, Mass.       
         Anna Sten, a melting-eyed but star-crossed Russian actress whom Samuel Goldwyn hoped to ballyhoo into another Garbo or Dietrich in the 1930's, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. Friends said she was in her late 80's.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her lawyer, Hiram G. Shields. He said she had been in poor health.         Miss Sten's case is cited by writers on film as a prime example of how, even in the golden age of the studio system, Hollywood moguls' plans to catapult promising performers to stardom sometimes went awry. As Ephraim Katz, a Hollywood historian and biographer, has written, "She somehow failed to appeal to American audiences."         Her early work in the Soviet Union included the title role in a 1927 comedy, "The Girl With the Hatbox," which has been lauded in the United States for her skillful acting. She then appeared in films in pre-Hitler Germany before Mr. Goldwyn took her to Hollywood, with much publicity. Exotic in Hollywood         Miss Sten's first acting there, the title role in "Nana" (1934), has been belittled as wooden though exotic. But she won critical praise with her sensitive portrayal of a wronged servant in her next film, "We Live Again" (1934). And her third Hollywood movie, "The Wedding Night" (1935), in which she co-starred with Gary Cooper, has been commended as entertaining. But it is also known for being, as Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 1993 calls it, "Samuel Goldwyn's third and final attempt to make Anna Sten a new Garbo."         After repeated poor box-office showings by her American movies, Mr. Goldwyn ended her contract, and she became known as "Goldwyn's folly." She went on to perform in a dozen other films.         Miss Sten was born in Kiev, now in Ukraine. Originally she was named Annel Stenskaya Sudakevich and was sometimes called Anyuschka. She got her start in acting with the Moscow Art Theater.         A friend, William Hughes, an actor, said yesterday that her first marriage, to a Russian-born film director, Fedor Ozep, ended in divorce, and that her second husband, Eugene Frenke, a film director and producer to whom she was married in the 1930's, died about five years ago.       
         Ellin Hobbins Mitchell, a private dealer in medieval and Renaissance art and Old Master drawings, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         Mrs. Mitchell, who had been suffering from brain lymphoma, was hit by a car early last month, said her husband, Jan, the New York businessman, art collector and former owner of Luchow's restaurant and the Longchamps restaurant chain.         She was born in Berlin but was taken to London by her parents before World War II. Educated at Cambridge, she became an actress, and she appeared with Mario Lanza in the 1959 film "For the First Time." She was under contract to Federico Fellini when she met and married Mr. Mitchell in 1960.         Mrs. Mitchell and her husband, from whom she was separated, were among the founders of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. She was also a director and a benefactor of the Bezalel Academy of Arts, Design and Architecture on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by three sons, David and Alexander, of Manhattan, and Oliver, of Tempe, Ariz.; her mother, Margot Hobbins of London, and a brother, Dr. Peter Hobbins of Zug, Switzerland.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980

Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades.         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929.         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas: "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget B movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer and screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Grace, Charm And Sophistication         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films. These are some of them.

         Dorothy Raedler, a stage director, choreographer and impresario who specialized in the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, died last Saturday at her home in St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, The Associated Press reported.         Miss Raedler's company, which began as Masque and Lyre Light Opera in 1939 and became the American Savoyards in 1952, was a highly regarded fixture in the New York musical world through the late 1960's. Miss Raedler began her work modestly, first directing her Gilbert and Sullivan productions in the homes of company members, then moving to the basement of the Jan Hus House on East 74th Street, and eventually to larger theaters. In the 1960's, she directed productions for the City Center Gilbert and Sullivan Company, the New York City Opera and the Baltimore Civic Opera.         Miss Raedler was born in New York. She organized the Masque and Lyre company as an amateur troupe during her student years at Hunter College and reorganized it as a semi-professional company in 1948. From the start, the company earned enthusiastic reviews from both music and drama critics, and it began to operate year round. In 1952, after a visit to England to research Gilbert and Sullivan traditions, she renamed the company the American Savoyards and took "The Mikado" and "Patience" on a cross-country tour. The following year, she instituted a summer season in Monmouth, Me.         Besides the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory, she directed productions of "Madama Butterfly," "Carmen," "The Merry Widow" and operettas by Victor Herbert, Franz Lehar and Rudolf Friml.         Miss Raedler was on the original board of the Harlem School of the Arts and helped found the St. Croix School of the Arts. She lived in St. Croix for 25 years and occasionally directed performances there, including a production of Scott Joplin's opera, "Treemonisha."         She is survived by her sister, Florence Storm of Big Rapids, Mich.       
         Dr. Marie H. Briehl, one of the country's earliest child psychoanalysts, died on Saturday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 96.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Dr. Briehl was director emeritus of the child analysis section at the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in Los Angeles.         Born in Czarist Russia, she came to this country as a toddler. She graduated from Hunter College and taught at Hunter College High School. Along with her husband, Dr. Walter Briehl, she received her psychoanalytic education in Vienna in the 1920's. She trained with Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund Freud and herself a founder of child analysis.         Returning to New York in 1930, Dr. Briehl resumed her teaching career and also started psychological and psychoanalytic treatment of children privately and at Mount Sinai Hospital. She became a full-time analyst in 1940.         Six years later, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where she established the training program for child analysis in the Southern California Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and worked as training and supervising analyst.         She became the first director of the institute's section on child analysis, serving for almost 20 years. She reached emeritus status in 1976 but continued to practice and teach in Los Angeles until moving back to New York in 1991.         Working in education, she helped found the Westland School in Los Angeles, a progressive school where she served as a consultant. She and her husband were active in human-rights causes, helping European analysts escape from Europe in the 1930's and establish themselves in the United States.         Her husband, a pioneer of group therapy methods, died in 1982. She is survived by a son, Dr. Robin Briehl of Lewisboro, N.Y.; a brother, Peter Hawley of Yonkers; two sisters, Elizabeth Delza Munson and Sophia Delza Glassgold, both of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.       
         Ann Ronell, a songwriter whose credits include "Willow, Weep for Me" and the lyrics for "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was heart and lung failure after surgery for a hernia, said her niece, Lali Ray.         In the early 30's, while coaching singers on Broadway, Miss Ronell wrote the hits "Baby's Birthday Party," "Rain on the Roof" and "Willow, Weep for Me," which won her a job with Walt Disney Studios.         She was the music director on many films and wrote the scores for "Champagne Waltz" (1937), "Algiers" (1938), "The Story of G.I. Joe" (1945) and "Love Happy" (1949).         Miss Ronell married the producer Lester Cowan in 1937. He died in 1990.       
         Barbara M. Kellogg, a dog breeder in Connecticut, died on Thursday at Bridgeport Hospital as a result of burns she received on Nov. 27 during a fire at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 82.         Mrs. Kellogg bred, raised and showed collies and was the first woman to be a director of the American Kennel Club. She was a graduate of Vassar College.         She is survived by her husband of 58 years, Winston T. Kellogg of Easton; a sister, Joan M. DeWind of Sherman, Conn.; three daughters, Joanna K. Uhry of Manhattan, Constance Casey of Wilmette, Ill., and Emily K. Hackett of Stamford, Conn., and nine grandchildren.
