         Lacey Fosburgh, a writer whose books chronicled murder, family passions and mystery in India, died last night at California Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. She was 50 years old and lived in Mill Valley, Calif.         Ms. Fosburgh, who began her writing career as a reporter for The New York Times, died of complications of breast cancer, said a friend of the family.         Ms. Fosburgh's books were the nonfiction "Closing Time" (1977) and the novels "Old Money" (1983), about a woman photographer's painful relationship with her father, and "India Gate" (1991), a sprawling, passionate novel set in India. At her death, she was writing a novel set in present-day New York City under contract to Simon & Schuster.         She was a staff reporter for the Times from 1968 to late 1973. In the last 20 years, she also wrote freelance newspaper and magazine articles, many of them for The Times, taught journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and was a consultant to newspapers, among them The Oakland Tribune.  Murder and Mysteries         A 1973 murder case about which Ms. Fosburgh wrote for The Times became the subject of "Closing Time," which was a selection of the Literary Guild and the Doubleday Book Club. It won a Mystery Writers of America award.         The murder victim was a troubled teacher, Roseann Quinn. The police said she took an Indiana drifter, John Wayne Wilson, home to her apartment on West 72d Street in Manhattan from a nearby singles bar. They said her body had been sexually mutilated. After being held five months on murder charges, Mr. Wilson hanged himself in his jail cell.         In "Contemporary Authors," a series of reference books, Truman Capote is quoted as remarking that the book showed that Ms. Fosburgh "is a skillful, selective reporter and also a literary artist."         Ms. Fosburgh was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Hugh Whitney Fosburgh, a journalist and author who died in 1976, and Helen Edwards Fosburgh. Through her paternal grandmother, Leila Whitney Fosburgh, Ms. Fosburgh was descended from the Whitney family. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and Sarah Lawrence College. She was a debutante at a dinner-dance at the St. Regis Hotel. From 1964 to 1966 she studied in New Delhi on a Fulbright grant.         Her 1973 marriage to Marc Libarle ended in divorce in 1975.         She is survived by her second husband, David Harris, a writer who was a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, whom she wed in 1977; a daughter from her second marriage, Sophie Whitney Harris of Mill Valley; her mother, who lives in Manhattan, and a brother, Pieter, of Manhattan.       
         Diana Adams, who was a leading ballerina with both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater and the former dean of students at the School of American Ballet, died on Sunday at Mark Twain-St. Joseph's Hospital in San Andreas, Calif. She was 66 and lived in Arnold, Calif.         Miss Adams was one of George Balanchine's favorite dancers and created roles in many of his major ballets of the 1950's. Among her most complex parts was the almost fiendishly demanding pas de deux she danced with Arthur Mitchell in the Balanchine-Stravinsky "Agon" in 1957. Mr. Mitchell later said of the duet and its unusual pivots and balances, "Diana's nervous intensity made the whole pas de deux work because it's not so much the difficulty of the steps or how flexible you are, it's the precariousness."         She also appeared in films, performing with Danny Kaye in "Knock on Wood" (1954) and in "Invitation to the Dance" (1956), directed by Gene Kelly. A Versatile Talent         Miss Adams was born in Staunton, Va. Her family later moved to New York City, and she studied there at Ballet Arts School, where one of her teachers was Agnes de Mille. Miss Adams made her stage debut in 1943 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Oklahoma!," choreographed by Miss de Mille. In 1944, she joined Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was then known.         Her talent and versatility were soon recognized. She performed the title role in David Lichine's comic "Helen of Troy," was the malevolent Queen of the Wilis in "Giselle," and was praised for her poignancy in Antony Tudor's bittersweet "Jardin aux Lilas" and for her ferocity in "Undertow," Tudor's ballet about slum life. In 1948, she created the role of the mother in Miss de Mille's "Fall River Legend."         She joined the New York City Ballet in 1950 and performed with it until 1963. She had a remarkable interpretative range and was as compelling in Balanchine'sabstractions as she was in Tudor's dance-dramas. John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1951 that under Balanchine's guidance, Miss Adams "has become theepitome of the lyric dancer."         In addition to "Agon," she danced leading roles in the premieres of Tudor's "Lady of the Camellias" (1951), Frederick Ashton's "Picnic at Tintagel" (1952), and important Balanchine creations including "Caracole" (1952), "Opus 34" (1954), "Episodes" (1959) and "Liebeslieder Walzer" (1960). Transition Into Teaching         She began teaching at the School of American Ballet while still a member of the company. After she stopped dancing, she served as dean of students at Balanchine's request until she retired in 1971. It was Miss Adams who chose the teen-age Suzanne Farrell at a School of American Ballet audition in 1960.         Miss Adams married the dancer Hugh Laing in 1947; they were divorced in 1953. Her second marriage, to the stage manager and lighting designer Ronald Bates, also ended in divorce. In recent years, Miss Adams lived quietly in retirement, although she did teach for several companies, including the State Ballet of Missouri, which is directed by Todd Bolender, one of her former colleagues at the New York City Ballet.         She is survived by a daughter, Georgina Bates of Antioch, Calif.

There is to be a funeral service at 2 P.M. on Saturday at Green Gulch Farm, Muir Beach, Calif.       
         Kay Swift, who wrote the music for the popular standards "Can't We Be Friends?," "Fine and Dandy" and "Can This Be Love?," died yesterday at the Alzheimer's Resource Center in Southington, Conn. She was 95.         She died of Alzheimer's disease, which was diagnosed three years ago, said a granddaughter, Katharine Weber.         Two of her most famous songs were written for the 1930 hit musical "Fine and Dandy," which had lyrics by Paul James (the pen name of her husband, James Paul Warburg, a banker) and was the first Broadway show for which all the music was composed by a woman. "Can't We Be Friends?" was introduced in 1929 in the hit revue "The Little Show," where it was sung by Libby Holman to Clifton Webb.         Miss Swift was romantically involved with George Gershwin in the 1930's, and she and Warburg divorced in 1935. Years later, Miss Swift was an invaluable resource to Gershwin scholars because she could fill in gaps in manuscripts and remember how Gershwin played his music.         Katharine Faulkner Swift was born on April 19, 1897, in New York City, where she grew up and studied piano, composition and orchestration. After playing in a classical trio, she was a rehearsal pianist for the 1927 show "A Connecticut Yankee." Two years later, she cracked Broadway as a composer with "Can't We Be Friends?" In 1930, "Fine and Dandy," opened on Broadway, where it ran for 236 performances.         When the choreographer George Balanchine came to the United States, Miss Swift wrote the music for his ballet "Alma Mater," a 1935 spoof of the Harvard-Yale football game. She was director of light music at the 1939 World's Fair, the same year she married Faye Hubbard, a rodeo cowboy. The marriage, which ended in 1947, was celebrated in her chatty 1943 memoir, "Who Could Ask for Anything More?," which was made into the movie "Never a Dull Moment," with Irene Dunne and Fred MacMurray.         A third marriage, to Hunter Galloway, a radio announcer, also ended in divorce.         Miss Swift also contributed songs to "The Garrick Gaieties" (1930) and wrote most of the score for "Paris '90," a one-woman revue for Cornelia Otis Skinner, in 1952. A song cycle for her grandchildren, "Reaching for the Brass Ring," was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1953. She also wrote songs for Radio City Music Hall revues, pieces for three world's fair exhibitions and commemorations for several national organizations, including the Camp Fire Girls and the American Medical Association.         Miss Swift made her last public appearance in 1986 at Merkin Concert Hall in Manhattan.         She is survived by two daughters, April Gagliano of Rome and Andrea Kaufman of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.       
         Katharine Morrison McClinton, the author of more than 30 books on antiques, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Julianna A. Mortensen, of Darien, Conn.         Mrs. McClinton, a native of San Francisco, graduated from Stanford University in 1921 and received a master's degree from Columbia University. Her books on antiques, published from 1929 to 1982, covered period furniture, American glass, American silver and Victorian furnishings, among other topics. Her best-known books were on the Art Deco movement and included "Art Deco for Collectors" and "Lalique for Collectors." She lectured widely on these subjects and continued writing for magazines until her death.         Mrs. McClinton's first marriage, to Richard Kahle, a San Diego lawyer, ended in divorce in 1935. Later that year she married Harold McClinton, an advertising executive, who died in 1977.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a stepson, Rear Adm. Robert Brock McClinton, retired, of Sequim, Wash., two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Diana Brewster Clark, an educator and an authority on dyslexia, died at her home in Manhattan on Sunday. She was 56.         Her daughter, Elise S. Pettus of Manhattan, said the cause of death was uterine cancer.         Dr. Clark was recognized for her research on remedial education for dyslexia. Her book, "Dyslexia; Theory and Practice of Remedial Instruction" (York Press, 1988), is a standard text on the subject.         In the preface to this work, Dr. Clark writes that despite considerable knowledge acquired over the last 50 years about the nature of dyslexia, a perception disorder that confuses images, it may be a long time before effective treatment is widely available. Instructional Methods         Noting that remedial practice "cannot afford to wait" for research, she presents a comprehensive study of existing instructional methods and programs for dyslexic students.         At the time of her death, Dr. Clark was an adjunct professor of education at Columbia University Teachers College and an active member of the Columbia Teachers College Alumni Council, of which she was moderator in 1988 and 1989. She was also a trustee of the New York City School Volunteers and a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society, the national advocacy group.         Dr. Clark, who was born in Manhattan, attended Vassar College and graduated from Barnard College in 1959. She received a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia in 1984. Taught at Marymount         As a learning disabilities specialist, Dr. Clark taught the teaching of reading to children and young adults at the Nightingale-Bamford School and at the Communications and Learning Center of Marymount Manhattan College.         Her latest work was a chapter on early reading and instruction in the book, "Learning About Learning Disabilities" (Academic Press, 1991).         She was a board member of the Shaker Museum and the Columbia County Land Conservancy, both in Chatham, N.Y.         Two marriages, to Thomas W. Pettus and to James M. Clark, ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter Elise, Dr. Clark is survived by a daughter, Ashley S. Pettus, and a son, Brewster W. Pettus, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Whitney Armstrong and Janet York of Manhattan, and a brother, Benjamin Brewster, also of Manhattan.       
         Patricia Schepps Vaill, a jewelry designer, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         Her daughter, Amanda Vaill Stewart, said the cause was complications of a stroke.         Until she became ill in 1990, Mrs. Vaill was acting as a design consultant. She was known for her work in the Art Deco style in jewelry and the use of beach glass and rock crystal.         Mrs. Vaill was the former president of Seaman Schepps, the Park Avenue jewelry design firm founded by her father in 1921. She took over after her father's death in 1972, retiring in 1988.         In May 1986, Interview magazine published an article about her that was illustrated by Robert Mapplethorpe.         She was born in San Francisco. She attended L'Ecole Mont-Choisi in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Todhunter School in New York City, where she studied American History under Eleanor Roosevelt.         Her marriage to John Arnold Vaill ended in divorce in 1975.         Besides her daughter, Amanda, a writer in New York City, she is survived by a sister, Virginia Jane Scott of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., and two grandchildren.       
         Masha Tumarkin, who helped institute a new technique for teaching English to upwards of 50,000 recent immigrants in New York City, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 49 and was a Manhattan resident.         The cause of death was leukemia, her family said.         For several years she was the director of the English program for the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that aids in resettlement. She employed a system by which students start speaking in English within 12 weeks, when conventional methods often take many months longer. She supervised development of texts and curriculum and teacher retraining.         The concept, developed by her predecessor, Ira Goetz, features a fast-paced, question-and-answer format in which the teacher moves about the classroom from one student to another.         Born in Manhattan to Russian immigrants, Ms. Tumarkin grew up in a bilingual home with relatives and neighbors speaking in accents. After graduating from Columbia, she earned a master's at New York University in teaching English as a second language. She taught English at City College before joining the association in 1980.         Her marriage to Ethan Gologor ended in a divorce that drew publicity for a custody accord in which the children shuttled between the mother's and father's homes on alternating days.         Her survivors include her husband of a year, Richard Girard; two sons, Matthew Gologor of Oberlin, Ohio, and Benjamin Gologor of Manhattan; her mother, Suzanne Tumarkin of Manhattan, and a sister, Nina Tumarkin of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.  Plays         Bab 1920  We Moderns 1923  Caesar and Cleopatra 1925  What Every Woman Knows 1926, 1938, 1954  Coquette 1927  Mary of Scotland 1933  Victoria Regina 1935  Ladies and Gentlemen 1939  Twelfth Night 1940  Harriet 1943  Happy Birthday 1946  The Wisteria Trees 1950  Mrs. McThing 1952  The Skin of Our Teeth 1955, 1961  The Glass Menagerie 1948, 1956, 1961  Time Remembered 1957  A Touch of the Poet 1958  The School for Scandal 1966  Right You Are (If You Think You Are) 1966  We Comrades Three 1966  The Show-Off 1967  The Front Page 1969  Harvey 1970 Films         The Sin of Madelon Claudet 1931  Arrowsmith 1931  A Farewell to Arms 1932  Night Flight 1933  What Every Woman Knows 1934  Vanessa, Her Love Story 1935  My Son John 1952  Anastasia 1956  Airport 1970 Television         The Snoop Sisters 1972  Victory at Entebbe 1976  A Family Upside Down 1978  Murder Is Easy 1982  A Caribbean Mystery 1983  Murder With Mirrors 1985       
         Kate Reid, an actress whose hundreds of roles included starring onstage in "Death of a Salesman," in the film "Atlantic City" and in television episodes of "Dallas," died on Saturday at her home in Stratford, Ontario. She was 62.         The cause of death was cancer, said her agent, Richard Schmenner.         For more than 40 years she was staple of stage, movies and television in the United States, Canada and Britain. A 1984 New York Times profile said, "Kate Reid may not be a household name to the general public, but she is to the theater industry, which knows her as an actress who works constantly."         Perhaps her most widely praised performance was as the wife of Dustin Hoffman's Willy Loman in the acclaimed revival of "Death of a Salesman" on Broadway in 1984 and for television in 1985.         "In the problematic role of the mother, Kate Reid is miraculously convincing," Frank Rich wrote in The Times, adding that "she somehow melds affection with pure steel." Richard Schickel said in Time magazine that her performance was "in its way as awesome as Hoffman's." A String of Nominations         Twice she was nominated for Tony Awards, first for co-starring with Alec Guinness in "Dylan" in 1964, then for her performance in "Slapstick Tragedy" on Broadway in 1965.         She was also twice nominated for Emmy Awards, for playing Queen Victoria in "The Invincible Mr. Disraeli" in 1963, then Mary Todd Lincoln in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" in 1964. Both were "Hallmark Hall of Fame" productions.         In the 1981 film "Atlantic City," she won high marks for her portrayal of the reclusive, aging former beauty queen and sometime paramour of the small-time mobster played by Burt Lancaster.         Ms. Reid, whose voice was described as cello-toned, once said: "I'm a chameleon. There is something of everything I play in me."         Her stage work included many Shakespearean parts, especially at the Stratford Festival in Canada in the 1960's. Major Roles on Broadway         In her Broadway debut in 1962, she was praised for her performance as Martha in the matinee cast of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" In 1968, she co-starred in "The Price," by Arthur Miller. She played Big Mama in the 1974 revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" with Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea and Fred Gwynne.         Her films include "The Andromeda Strain" (1971), "A Delicate Balance" (1973) and "Equus" (1977). Her many television roles included recurring appearances in "Dallas" as Aunt Lil Trotter.         Miss Reid was born in London and grew up in Toronto. She began acting while attending Havergal College, the University of Toronto and the Toronto Conservatory of Music, then formally studied acting under Uta Hagen at the Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.         Her marriages to Michael Sadlier and Austin Willis ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Reid Willis of Edmonton, Alberta, and a daughter, Robin Willis of Manhattan.       
         Judith Rothschild, an abstract painter whose works were shown internationally and who left a multi-million-dollar estate to support contemporary American artists, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan and in Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Ms. Rothschild painted for 55 years, beginning as a teen-ager. Her works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery in Washington and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., among others.         Her works were exhibited in many group shows and in several one-woman shows, including the first devoted to an American artist by the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, in 1991. Legacy to Museums and Artists         Ms. Rothschild left a collection that included her paintings and major works by Mondrian, Matisse, Brancusi, Gris and Picasso. The estate could bring up to $40 million, said its executor, Erik Stapper, and Harvey Miller, the trustee of the Judith Rothschild Foundation.         Under her will, the proceeds are to be used to foster art by helping public galleries and museums buy works of contemporary American artists over the next 25 years.         Ms. Rothschild was a founder and president of the American Abstract Artists Association. She also served on the boards of the American Federation of Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the New York Studio School and the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center.         A longtime colleague of Robert Motherwell, she joined him and a few other artists in forming a cooperative, the Long Point Gallery, in Provincetown on Cape Cod. A Youthful Talent         Ms. Rothschild displayed a flair for art as a youngster. Because of her interests, her parents began collecting art, including some of the major pieces now part of her estate. Her father, Herbert, owned a furniture manufacturing company.         Ms. Rothschild was born in New York City and graduated from Wellesley College. She studied painting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, and with Karl Knaths and Hans Hofmann.         She worked in oils and did many collages. Her style ranged from Cubist imagery to symbolic use of astrology charts, timetables, stamps and railroad tickets.         Her 23-year marriage to Anton Myrer, a novelist, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Manhattan, and a sister, Barbara Michaels of Ossining, N.Y.       
         Barbara Stoler Miller, chairwoman of the Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures Department at Barnard College, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said Beverly Solochek, spokeswoman for the college.         A member of the Barnard faculty since 1968, she was the Samuel R. Milbank Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Culture. Professor Miller was best known for translations of Sanskrit literature, including "The Bhagavad-Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War" (Bantam Books and Columbia University Press, 1986).         She was also an adviser to Peter Brooks on "The Mahabharata," performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1987 and broadcast on public television.         Her first marriage, to Dr. James Robert Miller, ended in divorce.         Surviving are her husband, Max Greenwood; a daughter, Gwenn Miller; her mother, Sarah Stoler of Stowe, Vt.; a brother, Will Stoler, of Montpelier, Vt., and her sister, Ann Stoler of Ann Arbor, Mich.       
         Patricia Peardon, the actress who created the central role in "Junior Miss" on Broadway, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her daughter Christine Noel Cameron of Manhattan.         Miss Peardon grew up in Allendale, N.J., and first began acting at the age of 8 on such radio programs as "Cavalcade of America" and "March of Time."  A Sassy Teen-Ager         In 1941, when she was 17, she made her Broadway debut at the Lyceum Theater in the hit comedy "Junior Miss," after having been discovered in an audition by the play's director, Moss Hart. Miss Peardon originated the role of Judy Graves, a sassy but frequently muddled adolescent.         Miss Peardon "is acting the central part of the younger sister like an inspired bear cub," said Brooks Atkinson in his review in The New York Times.         While starring in the play, Miss Peardon appeared on the cover of Life on Dec. 11, 1941, the week after Pearl Harbor was bombed; it was too late for the magazine's editors to change the cover.         In the early 1950's she acted in the television series "Johnny Jupiter," and in 1955, on Broadway, she played the spitfire younger daughter in the Tony Award-winning play "The Desperate Hours," acting with Paul Newman and Karl Malden.         In the 1950's and 60's, Miss Peardon toured with Arnold Moss's Shakespeare Festival Players in "The Tempest," "Measure for Measure," "Twelfth Night," "King Lear" and "Love's Labour's Lost," and performed in the 1960's at the American Festival Theater at Stratford, Conn.  As a Sculptor         In 1966, she began exhibiting and selling cast bronze sculptures, which were displayed three times in the windows at Tiffany & Company in Manhattan. Her work was also shown at many galleries, at Tufts University, and at the Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall.         Miss Peardon was married three times: to Peter Kalischer, a broadcast journalist; to Peter Brandt Harmon, a writer, and to Richard Horner, a producer. The marriages ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Cameron, she is survived by another daughter, Anne Cameron of Albuquerque, N.M., and a grandson, Alexander Cameron Little.       
         Grace Lansing Lambert, a philanthropist and breeder of champion dogs and horses, died on Thursday at The Medical Center at Princeton, in Princeton, N.J. A resident of Princeton, she was 93.         The cause of death was pneumonia and advanced Parkinson's disease, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. Lambert was the widow of Gerard Barnes Lambert, her second husband, whose family's fortune was built on Listerine mouthwash and the manufacturing concern that became part of the Warner-Lambert Company. Mr. Lambert, an international yachtsman, died in 1967 at the age of 80.         Mrs. Lambert served on the boards of the Pierpont Morgan Library, Princeton University Library and Art Museum, and the University of Pennsylvania, among others. The Lamberts' former Princeton home, Albemarle, now houses the American Boychoir School, one of her beneficiaries.         Mrs. Lambert's Harrowby Kennels in Hopewell, N.J., bred show and field-trial dogs. She also raised Morgan horses, a breed of light horses.         A native of Canandaigua, N.Y., she married Mr. Lambert in 1936 after her first marriage, to John Mull, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Lambert is survived by two stepdaughters, Rachel Mellon of Upperville, Va., and Lily McCarthy of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Raphaelle Jeanne Semmes, a senior civil servant who became executive director of the Bush Administration's Commission on Environmental Quality, died Tuesday at the Washington Home Hospice. She was 46 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, said her sister Walden S. Morton.         Miss Semmes went into Government service in 1970 as a supervisor in the Department of Transportation. She served as executive secretary of the Peace Corps from 1982 to 1989.         In the fall of 1991 she was named executive director of the new panel set up to advise President George Bush on ways to protect the environment without excessive cost.         Miss Semmes was born in New Orleans. She graduated from George Washington University and received a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         Her marriage to Robert Taylor of Washington ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, Walden, of Center Harbor, N.H., she is survived by a son, Raphael James Taylor; her parents, Vice Adm. Benedict J. Semmes, retired, and Katherine Ainsworth Semmes of Washington; another sister, Amy Semmes Waite of Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, Dr. B. J. Semmes of Chevy Chase, Md.       
         Marka Truesdale duPont, a patron of mental-health groups and the performing arts, died Tuesday at her home in Wilmington, Del. She was 82.         She had had a prolonged illness, her family said.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Chapin School. As a young woman, she worked for the Henry Street Settlement Theater.         Moving to Vermont in 1942, she became publisher and editor of The Burlington Daily News. During her tenure it won an award from Editor and Publisher magazine for exposing squalid conditions at a reform school for boys and at the state mental hospital in Waterbury.         Later, in Delaware, she was the founding chairman of that state's Mental Health Association and an officer and fund-raiser in the National Association for Mental Health, of which she was a past president.         Mrs. duPont's first marriage, to Grover Loening, an aviation designer with Orville Wright, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, A. Felix duPont Jr., a member of the duPont family of Wilmington; two daughters by her previous marriage, Louise Truesdale Loening of Landenberg, Pa., and Priscilla Loening Hanford of Paradise, Calif.; a son, Christopher T. duPont of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepson, Michael Hoyt duPont of Union, Wash.; a stepdaughter, Katharine duPont Gahagan of Wilmington, and a sister, Anne Truesdale Broadhurst of Wilton, Conn.       
         Julia Knickerbocker, a leader in the field of book publicity, died on Sunday at the Robert Janker Clinic in Bonn. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after fighting cancer for two years, said her sister, Miranda de Kay.         A longtime public relations executive in book publishing, Ms. Knickerbocker influenced a whole generation of young public relations executives who now hold significant positions in various houses. She was known for her elegance, wit and style.         At her death, she was vice president and director of media relations at Bantam Books in New York. There she worked with authors such as Robert Pirsig, whose "Lila" (1991) became a major best seller.         "She was that rare publicist equally adept at getting attention for literary, serious kiss-and-tell and pop entertainment novels," said Stuart Applebaum, vice president of publicity and public relations at Bantam Doubleday Dell.         Much of her career was with Simon & Schuster, where she began in 1974 as a senior publicist and rose to be associate publisher. For more than a decade as director of publicity, she was the driving force behind all of Simon & Schuster's campaigns, working with such best-selling authors as Jackie Collins and Jane Fonda.         She began her career at M. Evans & Company in 1967 and later headed the publicity department at William Morrow & Company.         She was born in Paris, where her father, H. R. Knickerbocker, was a correspondent for United Press. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1958.         Her marriage to Charles La Muniere ended in divorce.         Besides her sister Mrs. de Kay, she is survived by another sister, Suzanne Colt, and two daughters, Noelle La Muniere McElroy Carter and Suzanne La Muniere, all of Manhattan.       
         Maria Tolstoy, a professor of Russian language and a granddaughter of the novelist Leo Tolstoy, died on Monday at home in Manhattan. She was 85.         She had a brief illness, said Cynthia Whittaker, a friend.         Ms. Tolstoy fled her native Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, resettled in Czechoslovakia, then left there in 1939 to escape the Nazis and World War II.         Arriving by ship in America in 1940, she said, "I believe, with my grandfather, that every person, every country, has a right to freedom." She helped Soviet and German emigres publish political material, worked on foreign broadcasts of Radio Liberty and assisted the United States Army.         Ms. Tolstoy, whose mother was Irish, was fluent in both English and Russian. Her parents met when her father visited Ireland to buy race horses. Active in Politics         She taught Russian at Cornell, Columbia and Indiana Universities, at the University of Michigan and at Hunter College. She retired from Hunter in 1980 but continued tutoring students the rest of her life.         Ms. Tolstoy was active in American politics as a Republican but also supported Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and was state co-chairwoman of Republicans for Cuomo.         She was also known for her published Russian poetry on the solitude of the emigre. With the recent fall of Communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, she expressed interest in a return visit to her native country but was too frail to make the trip.         Ms. Tolstoy left the Soviet Union in 1925 at the age of 17. She completed her studies for a doctorate in Slavic linguistics at Charles University in Prague, but the Nazis shut down the school before it granted the degree.         Her marriage to Vladimir Mansvetov ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Tatiana Benetkova of Prague, and two grandchildren.       
         Dame Freya Stark, a resourceful and scholarly travel writer who was the first Westerner to journey through many regions of the Middle East, died on Sunday at her home in Asolo in northeast Italy. She was 100..         Dame Freya, who was born in Paris and grew up in several homes in England and Italy, wrote 24 travel books and autobiographies and eight volumes of letters from the 1930's to the 1980's. Many of the books have been reprinted several times, recently by Transatlantic Arts and Overlook Press, among other houses, and were based on often hazardous journeys by vehicle, camel and donkey.         Dame Freya's books about the Middle East and nearby countries were called lucid, spontaneous and elegant and were lauded for imparting an inspired sense of both history and people. The consensus of reviewers was that she wrote with spirit, authority and humor and that she was a consummate traveler because of her fearlessness, candor, charm, idealism and streak of naivete.         In a foreword to "The Journey's Echo: Selections From Freya Stark" (1964), the writer Lawrence Durrell praised her as a "poet of travel" and "one of the most remarkable women of our age." Many Languages and Dialects         Dame Freya was essentially self-taught. In her youth, she became fluent in Arabic and Turkish, and over the years she mastered other languages and many dialects. It was a talent that served her well in the course of a venturesome life as reflected in the titles of her books: "Baghdad Sketches" (1933 and 1937), "The Valleys of the Assassins and Other Persian Travels" (1934, 1972 and 1978), "The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut" (1936 and 1972), "A Winter in Arabia" (1940, 1972 and 1987), "Letters From Syria" (1942), "The Freya Stark Story" (1953), "Alexander's Path" (1958 and 1988) and "Gateways and Caravans: A Portrait of Turkey" (1971).         Freya Madeline Stark was born in Paris on Jan. 31, 1893, to Robert Stark, a British sculptor, and Flora Stark, a painter and pianist. Her parents separated in her childhood, and her formal education was mainly at the University of London and the nearby School of Oriental and African Studies.         In World War I she was a nurse in Italy, and in World War II she worked for the British Information Ministry, earning prominence and honors for enhancing British influence and countering Axis propaganda in Aden, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and India. In Cairo, she founded the Brotherhood of Freedom, a democratic anti-Fascist movement.         Years later, she observed that Britain eventually lost India and prestige throughout the Middle East because of "a lack of clearness and faith in our own values." Honors and Godchildren         She was awarded a Cross of the British Empire in 1953 and was named a Dame of the British Empire in 1972.         In 1947, when she was 54, she married Stewart Perowne, a diplomat and historian. They separated in 1952 but did not divorce. Mr. Perowne died in 1989. They had no children, but Dame Freya had many godchildren, in many countries.         One godson, Malise Ruthven, wrote a 144-page tribute, "Traveler Through Time: A Photographic Journey With Freya Stark," which was published in 1986. In the book, he observed: "Freya never lost her passion for acquiring fresh knowledge and new skills. Writing, like travel, she saw as the pursuit of truth."         At 93, as she was planning a trip to Spain, Dame Freya was asked about death. She replied, "I feel about it as about the first ball, or the first meet of hounds, anxious as to whether one will get it right, and timid and inexperienced -- all the feelings of youth."       
         Penelope Gilliatt, a writer of fiction, journalism and screenplays, and a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 61.         She had been in poor health for some time.         Ms. Gilliatt (pronounced with a hard G) was best known for the film criticism she wrote from 1968 to 1979 for The New Yorker, where she shared reviewing duties with Pauline Kael, and for her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," a 1971 film starring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch.         Her short stories were marked by precision, compression and a gift for conveying a dramatic situation through dialogue. Anthony Burgess, reviewing her short-story collection "Nobody's Business" for The New York Times Book Review in 1971, wrote: "She is intelligent, economical, poignant, highly contemporary. She is also innovative."         Ms. Gilliatt, whose maiden name was Penelope Conner, was born in London. Her father, a barrister and later a judge, worked as a director of the BBC. After attending Queen's College, a private school, she came to the United States to enter Bennington College in Vermont on a scholarship. She dropped out during her first year. "I thought I should get on with life, and I'd run out of money," she later said in a newspaper interview. A Contest Winner         A brief period working for the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York ended when she won a short-story contest sponsored by British Vogue. She returned to London to join the magazine's staff, eventually becoming its features editor. She also contributed freelance articles to The Spectator and New Statesman.         From 1961 to 1967, Ms. Gilliatt served as film critic and, for one year, drama critic of The Observer in London. In 1968 she joined The New Yorker, where, in addition to reviewing film, she contributed many short stories and profiles.         Her first novel, "One by One" (1965), about a menage a trois, contained the seeds of her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," about a London couple, a man and a woman, in love with the same man. The screenplay, which was widely praised for its sensitive, literate treatment of a potentially exploitative subject, was nominated for an Academy Award.  The National Society of Film Critics named it the best screenplay of the year, and the New York film critics, in a tie vote, named her co-winner for best screenplay with Larry McMurtry, for "The Last Picture Show.         Ms. Gilliatt left The New Yorker in 1979 on an extended leave of absence after writing a profile on the novelist Graham Greene whose accuracy was challenged by Greene. A novelist, Michael Mewshaw, also complained to the magazine that material in the article had been taken, without credit, from an artcile he had written on Greene for The Nation. At the time, Ms. Gilliatt said that Mr. Greene's charges were a subtle form of practical joke. She continued to contribute short stories to the magazine and in recent years wrote profiles of John Cleese and Jonathan Miller. Known for Her Stories         Although Ms. Gilliatt wrote five novels, including "A State of Change" (1968) and "The Cutting Edge" (1979), she was best known for her stories, collected in "Come Back if It Doesn't Get Better" (1969), "Nobody's Business" (1972), "Splendid Lives" (1978), "Quotations From Other Lives" (1982) and "They Sleep Without Dreaming" (1985).         Ms. Gilliatt's New Yorker film criticism and profiles were collected in "Unholy Fools" (1973) and "Three-Quarter Face" (1980). Her last book was "To Wit: Skin and Bones of Comedy" (1990), a collection of essays.         Both her marriages, to Roger Gilliatt, a neurosurgeon, and the playwright John Osborne ended in divorce.         She is survived by a sister, Angela Conner of London, and a daughter, Nolan Osborne Parker of East Sussex.       
         Jean Bodfish Brown, a civic leader in New York and Chicago, died on June 18 at her home in Chicago at the age of 52. The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Brown was a founding member and chairwoman of the Friends of the Zoo, which worked with the New York Zoological Society to help renovate the Central Park Zoo and to foster environmental education in city schools.         Later she helped found the Food Animal Concerns Trust, which advocates treating farm animals humanely. She was on the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago and was co-chairwoman of its centennial celebration.         She was also the president of the Alliance Francaise de Chicago from 1990 to 1992. She helped revitalize the organization, open its new headquarters and expand its program of concerts, lectures and films.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Orinda, Calif. She was a graduate of Wellesley College. Her marriage to Joel B. Leff ended in divorce.         Surviving are her husband of 17 years, Robert A. Brown; a son, Adam B. Leff of Los Angeles; a sister, Margaret Bodfish of Orinda, and three stepsons, Samuel Brown of Iron River, Mich., Robert Brown of Cordova, Alaska, and David Brown of Alta, Utah.       
         Doris Jonas Freed, a national authority on family law who headed the American Bar Association's committee on divorce law and procedures, died on July 23 at Keswick Nursing Home in Baltimore. She was 90 and had lived in Manhattan until May.         Her daughter, Gloria Kane, said the cause was heart failure.         Dr. Freed was an expert and practitioner in matrimonial law who wrote extensively on different aspects of family law. She was co-author of the six-volume revision of "Law and the Family, New York" (Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Corporation, Rochester, 1986-90) with the late Henry H. Foster and Joel R. Brandes, and co-author of the original treatise with Mr. Foster in 1966.  Wrote Monthly Column         As head of the American Bar Association's committee on research, she was influential in drafting the 1980 reform of the New York State divorce law, which was based on the premise that marriage is an economic "partnership of co-equals."         Until her death, Dr. Freed co-authored with Mr. Brandes and Carole L. Weidman "Law and the Family," a monthly column in The New York Law Journal. Recent studies include: "Electronic Surveillance of Family Conversations," (January 1993) "Surrogate Parenting Contracts," (February 1993), and "Transfers of Pension Benefits," (June 1993)         Tracking family-law cases and legal trends for the American Bar Association, Dr. Freed was co-author of the annual study "Family Law in the 50 States," initially with Mr. Foster and subsequently with Prof. Timothy Walker. This study appears in The Family Law Quarterly and reviews developments in family law like no-fault divorce, fair distribution of property, homemaker's contribution, rights to retirement benefits, spousal support and child-support enforcement.         Dr. Freed was born in a suburb of St. Louis. She earned her law degrees from New York University School of Law, receiving her doctorate in 1958. Already active professionally, she was named first vice president of the Women's Lawyers Assocation in 1956.         Her practice was based in New York City, where in recent years she was of counsel to the firm of Brandes, Weidman & Spatz. Before that she was counsel to Winer, Neuburger & Sive, and earlier was counsel to the Harvey Sladkus firm.         Dr. Freed received the exceptional merit award from the Family Law Section of the American Bar Association every year from 1980 to 1989. Besides her work for the national association, she chaired the custody committee and the surrogate parenting committee of the New York State Bar Association's Family Law Section.         Her husband, Arthur Freed, died in 1990.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Dallas, she is survived by a granddaughter.       
         Sophia Yarnall Jacobs, a lifelong advocate of civil and human rights, died on Wednesday at her home on Mount Desert Island in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 91.         Her daughter, Charlton Yarnall Phelps, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Mrs. Jacobs was former president of the Urban League of Greater New York and the National Council of Women. She was active in the Urban League movement for more than 20 years and served as vice president and trustee of the National Urban League.         As head of the league's chapter for Greater New York from 1955 to 1960, she fought school segregation, pressed for more public housing on vacant land sites and led action for legislation barring racial discrimination in private housing.  Headed Women's Council         In 1959, Mrs. Jacobs took part in the first "woman-to-woman" exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. She became president of the National Council of Women in 1960 and was chairwoman of the 75th anniversary of the International Council of Women and the national affiliate, in Washington in 1963.         Born in Haverford, Pa., she attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. In 1921, she married Reginald Robert Jacobs, a Philadelphia banker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1937.         While in Philadelphia, she wrote many articles of interest to women, published in Good Housekeeping, Country Life, Harper's Bazaar, Parents, Reader's Digest and other magazines. From 1937 to 1945, she served as executive secretary of the Philadelphia Orchestra Club and then became promotion manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wrote Historical Novel         In 1945, she went to San Francisco as an observer at the birth of the United Nations.         Mrs. Jacobs moved to New York in 1954, where she was an officer of numerous civic and educational organizations. She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Committee on Africa, Howard University, Planned Parenthood-World Population and the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living Environment.         She was the author of a historical novel, "The Clark Inheritance," based on her family's history in the develpment of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. She is remembered by many as Sophy, the group leader, in her friend Emily Kimbrough's book, "Pleasure by the Busload."         Besides her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Denholm Muir Jacobs of Northeast Harbor; 6 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Baker Martineau, long active in the New York Heart Association and other charitable organizations, died yesterday in Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Martineau had been visiting a friend in Washington, Conn., when she entered the hospital. The cause of her death was complications from bronchial pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Martineau was a supporter of the Muscular Dystrophy Research Fund at Children's Hospital in Boston.         Born in Manhattan, she was a daughter of George F. Baker Jr., a banker, and the former Edith Brevoort Kane. She was a granddaughter of George F. Baker, a director of 43 banks and corporations. Mrs. Martineau graduated from what is now called the Hewitt School and Sarah Lawrence College.  She lived in Washington, Conn., before moving to Palm Beach nine years ago.         Her marriage in 1932 to Thomas Suffern Tailer, a sportsman, ended in divorce. In 1941 she married Stanley Martineau, a sculptor whose works included a bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Mr. Martineau died in 1977.         Mrs. Martineau is survived by 2 daughters from her first marriage, Fern de Narvaez of Palm Beach and Wendy Holt of Cool, Calif.; a son from her second marriage, Michael, of Granville, Mass.; 9 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Diana Vincent-Daviss, a professor of law and law librarian at Yale University Law School, died on Tuesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 50.         A spokeswoman for the university said she died of a cerebral aneurysm.         She was appointed law librarian at Yale in 1991 after serving in a similar capacity at New York University for eight years, during which she supervised the expansion of the law library, doubling its physical size.         She was known for her work on the preservation of library materials and was a consultant to more than a dozen law libraries, including libraries in Chile, which she assisted under a grant from the United States Agency for International Development.  Author of Handbooks         She was also involved in the promotion of international human rights and was recently named deputy director of the Orville H. Schell Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale. The center promotes research and assists lawyers and organizations concerned about preserving individual rights and freedoms and acts as a clearing house for information.         She was the author of many articles and handbooks, including a three-part research guide on human rights law that was published by New York University.         She was born in Birmingham, England. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in law at Cambridge and a master's degree in library science at Columbia University in 1972.         Her marriage to Stephen Elias ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Megan Elias of San Rafael, Calif., and two sisters, Elizabeth Christenfeld of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Lucy Vincent-Daviss of Evesham, England.       
         Jacobina Caro, a dancer, choreographer and acting coach, died on Sept. 13 at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 90.         The cause was a stroke, a family member said.         Ms. Caro coached actors and singers in the Los Angeles area until the last month of her life. She was born in Elizabeth, N.J., and worked in the 1940's as a choreographer for the Works Projects Administration. Her work included "Run, Little Chillun," which was performed nationwide. She also taught at the Actors' Laboratory in Los Angeles.         In the 50's, she was commissioned by Daytop, the drug and alcohol rehabiliation center in Manhattan, to create a theater piece called "The Concept." In 1968, a restaging of the piece, which relates the struggle of a young addict to give up drugs and renew his life, was acclaimed by critics and became an Off Broadway event.         Ms. Caro reworked the piece as the cultural director at Daytop. She said she restaged it to create a more realistic style in the performance and to inject a bit more humor. The theater profits went to assist Daytop.         She was the widow of Robert Meltzer, who died in World War II. A later marriage ended in divorce. Ms. Caro is survived by a daughter, Jo Victory Sadalla of Phoenix, and a grandson, Jed.       
         Nina Berberova, a Russian-born poet, novelist, playwright, critic and professor of literature whose biography is a classic of the Russian emigre Diaspora, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Philadelphia. She was 92.         She died of complications from a fall last March, said Dr. Murl G. Barker, a friend, who is chairman of the Russian department at Rutgers University.         Miss Berberova is best known for her 1969 autobiography, "The Italics Are Mine," written during the years 1960 to 1965. Many of the figures in the worlds of emigre arts and politics -- including Anna Akhmatova, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Nabokov, Maxim Gorky and Fyodor Sologub -- come vividly alive in her reminiscences.         "She has brilliantly evoked the atmosphere of literary Petrograd," wrote a critic in The New York Times Book Review in 1969, adding that the memoirs "have yielded some remarkable portraits and vignettes." The book was re-issued last year by Alfred A. Knopf in a revised translation.  A Film From Her Novella         Recognition for her fiction came late, but French, German and English critics have compared Miss Berberova's sharp, incisive writing to that of Turgenev's and Chekhov's. Her 1934 novella "The Accompanist," about a young woman pianist who accompanies and competes with a soprano, was made into a film this year by the French director Claude Miller.         A selection of Miss Berberova's novellas, "The Tattered Cloak and Other Novels," was published by Knopf in 1991. Michiko Kakutani, writing in The Times, said: "Long overdue in America, this collection of stories deserves a wide and appreciative audience, while Miss Berberova herself deserves recognition as one of the most captivating Russian writers alive today."         Her fiction has been on best-seller lists in France, and she was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government in 1989.         Miss Berberova (pronounced bur-BEAR-uh-vuh) was born in 1901 in St. Petersburg; her father was an Armenian civil servant; her mother was Russian. She attended Rostov University and was involved in the literary and artistic ferment in that city until she left in 1922, accompanying the poet Vladislav Khodasevich. Together they traveled about Europe as members of the household of Maxim Gorky, before settling in Paris in 1925. Reported the News         Miss Berberova then began a 15-year affiliation with the Russian-language daily Poslednye Novosti, reporting news events and writing book reviews, critical articles, short fiction and theater and movie reviews. She was also one of the founders of the emigre weekly Russkaya Mysl' in 1947.         She wrote four novels and "Tchaikovsky," a biography of the composer. Appearing in 1937, the book created a sensation because it dealt openly with the composer's homosexuality.         In 1950 Miss Berberova immigrated to the United States, working at a variety of jobs until she became the editor of the journal Mosty. In 1958 she joined the Slavic department at Yale University, and in 1963 she moved on to Princeton, where she taught until 1971.         Miss Berberova was the partner of Khodasevich until the 1930's, but they were never married. She married Nikolai Makeyev, a journalist, in 1937; and in the 1950's, George Kochevitsky, a musician who died last month. Both marriages ended in divorce.         Miss Berberova, who became a United States citizen, returned to Russia in 1989.         She received an honorary doctorate from Middlebury College in 1983, and another from Yale University last year. She moved from Princeton to Philadelphia in 1990.       
         Alice S. Morris, for many years a figure on New York's literary scene, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was sudden respiratory failure, her family said.         From 1951 to 1968, Mrs. Morris was the literary editor of Harper's Bazaar. Herself a writer and critic of modern fiction, she helped to introduce many fresh American authors to the reading public.         PEN International awarded her a Sue Kaufman Lifetime Achievement Award in 1977 for the editorial assistance she had given to new and emerging writers.         Born in Manhattan, she grew up in Morristown, N.J.         After retiring from Harper's Bazaar at the age of 65, Mrs. Morris, who had no college degree, started a new career at Columbia University teaching short-story writing. She later lectured at the New School, where she continued to hold classes until she turned 80.         She was the editor of "An Uncommon Reader" (Avon Books, 1965), a selection of 35 outstanding short stories she had steered toward publication in Harper's Bazaar. She also wrote a book of poems, "Crane on the Hackmatack." At her death she was working on a series of humorous poems.         Mrs. Morris's marriage to Harvey Breit, playwright and novelist, ended in divorce. Mr. Breit died in 1968 at 58.         She is survived by a son, Luke Breit of Mendocino, Calif.; a daughter, Miranda Breit of Piney River, Va.,and three grandchildren.       
         Zita Johann, a stage and film actress who played Boris Karloff's love interest in "The Mummy," died on Friday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 89 and lived in Orangeburg, N.Y.         The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Rosemary Franck.         Miss Johann was born near Temesvar, Hungary, now Timisoara, Romania. She moved to New York City with her family when she was 7 and appeared in high school productions. After applying to the Theater Guild for work as an understudy, she immediately won roles in touring productions of "Peer Gynt," "The Devil's Disciple" and "He Who Gets Slapped."         She made her Broadway debut in 1924 in the Theater Guild's production of "Man and the Masses." Other leading roles followed, in "Machinal" (1928), "Tomorrow and Tomorrow" (1931) and other plays. To Hollywood and Back         In 1931 she played the wife of a steelworker who succumbs to drink in "The Struggle," the last film by D. W. Griffith. Most memorably, she played Helen Grosvenor in "The Mummy" (1932), whom the Mummy takes to be the vestal priestess for whom he conceived a forbidden passion 3,700 years earlier.         After appearing in "Tiger Shark" (1932), "Luxury Liner" (1933) and "Grand Canary" (1934), she returned to New York to act in the theater. She appeared in "Panic" (1935), "Flight Into China" (1939), "The Burning Deck" (1940) and "The Broken Journey" (1942).         During World War II, she raised money for war-related charities and organized shows for American soldiers on their way overseas. In recent decades, she worked with disturbed children and gave private acting lessons.         Her three marriages, to John Houseman, the director, John McCormick, an agent, and Bernard E. Shedd, an economist and publisher, all ended in divorce. She had no children.       
         Marion Magid Hoagland, managing editor of Commentary magazine, died on Sept. 3 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoagland died of cancer, said her daughter, Molly Hoagland.         Mrs. Hoagland was a member of the Commentary staff for 30 years, becoming managing editor in 1968. She also wrote essays and reviews on cultural and literary subjects for that magazine and others.         She graduated from Barnard College, was a Fulbright Scholar in Berlin and was an actress and playwright in Manhattan as well as a journalist. Her marriage to Edward M. Hoagland ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter, of Manhattan, and a brother, Henry Magid of Oradell, N.J.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Mary Luke, a biographer who wrote about Tudor and Elizabethan figures, died yesterday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Ridgefield, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Luke wrote "Catherine, the Queen" (1967), a portrait of Henry VIII's hapless first wife, Catherine of Aragon. "A Crown for Elizabeth" (1970) limned the turbulent years between 1527, when Henry maneuvered for a divorce from Catherine for lack of a male heir, and 1558, when Elizabeth I ascended to the throne.         In a review of "A Crown for Elizabeth" for The New York Times, Lady Antonia Fraser wrote, "To the sympathetic retelling of history, Mrs. Luke has made a notable contribution and one that will give much pleasure to its readers."         "The Nine Days Queen: A Portrait of Lady Jane Grey" (1986) told the story of Jane Grey's brief hold on the scepter in July 1553 and her subsequent martyrdom. Mrs. Luke also wrote a novel, "The Nonsuch Lure" (1976), and "The Ivy Crown: A Biographical Novel of Queen Katherine Paar" (1984).         Born in Pittsfield, Mass., Mrs. Luke, whose original name was Mary Munger, graduated from Berkshire Business School and worked in advertising in New York, and later for a documentary film company and RKO Studios in Hollywood.         Mrs. Luke's marriage to the late David L. Luke Jr., a corporate executive, ended in divorce. She is survived by a daughter, Melinda C. Luke, also of Ridgefield; four brothers, John, Donald, Clifford and Raymond Munger, all of Pittsfield; two sisters, Dorothy Panzeri of Canaan, N.Y., and Ruth Durant of Pittsfield, and two granddaughters.       
         Claudia McNeil, an actress known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "A Raisin in the Sun," died on Thursday in the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 77 and had lived in the home for nine years.         The cause was complications of diabetes, said Rita Madero, a friend.         At the opening of "A Raisin in the Sun," by Lorraine Hansberry, in 1959 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Miss McNeil won praise for her heroic performance as the matriarch in a black family on the South Side of Chicago. Critics found that Miss McNeil imbued that simple character with nobility of spirit. Film and Musical Versions         Miss McNeil went on to be a member of what has been lauded by critics as the outstanding cast of the 1961 film of "A Raisin in the Sun," directed by Daniel Petrie. The introspective movie, confined largely to one room, was found to be as fine as the play.         On the screen, Miss McNeil was stolid, voluminous and serene as a mother trying to control her son and wanting to buy her family a respectable home.         She was also was praised as bringing a commanding presence to a 1981 production of the musical "Raisin," presented by Equity Library Theater.         In the 1959 production, she weighed nearly 300 pounds, as she did in a television production of "The Member of the Wedding." But by 1978, when she sang at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, she had slimmed down to 159 pounds and observed, "I lost a whole person."         Until then, she had not sung in New York since she appeared in Langston Hughes's "Simply Heavenly" in 1957. Before then, she had been a slender dancer and singer.         Miss McNeil was born in Baltimore. She became a licensed librarian and early in her carer sang in vaudeville theatres and on the radio as well as in nightclubs. She made her legitimate New York stage debut in 1953, when she began playing Tituba in "The Crucible" at the Martin Beck Theater. She also appeared in the 1959 film "The Last Angry Man."         Early in her career, before she reached Broadway in "Simply Heavenly," she sang in Harlem and Greenwich Village and on 52d Street. She also toured with the Katherine Dunham troupe.         Ms. Madero said that Miss McNeil was married when she was 18 to a man who died in World War II, and that her second marriage ended in divorce after two years.       
         Anna Sten, a melting-eyed but star-crossed Russian actress whom Samuel Goldwyn hoped to ballyhoo into another Garbo or Dietrich in the 1930's, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. Friends said she was in her late 80's.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her lawyer, Hiram G. Shields. He said she had been in poor health.         Miss Sten's case is cited by writers on film as a prime example of how, even in the golden age of the studio system, Hollywood moguls' plans to catapult promising performers to stardom sometimes went awry. As Ephraim Katz, a Hollywood historian and biographer, has written, "She somehow failed to appeal to American audiences."         Her early work in the Soviet Union included the title role in a 1927 comedy, "The Girl With the Hatbox," which has been lauded in the United States for her skillful acting. She then appeared in films in pre-Hitler Germany before Mr. Goldwyn took her to Hollywood, with much publicity. Exotic in Hollywood         Miss Sten's first acting there, the title role in "Nana" (1934), has been belittled as wooden though exotic. But she won critical praise with her sensitive portrayal of a wronged servant in her next film, "We Live Again" (1934). And her third Hollywood movie, "The Wedding Night" (1935), in which she co-starred with Gary Cooper, has been commended as entertaining. But it is also known for being, as Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 1993 calls it, "Samuel Goldwyn's third and final attempt to make Anna Sten a new Garbo."         After repeated poor box-office showings by her American movies, Mr. Goldwyn ended her contract, and she became known as "Goldwyn's folly." She went on to perform in a dozen other films.         Miss Sten was born in Kiev, now in Ukraine. Originally she was named Annel Stenskaya Sudakevich and was sometimes called Anyuschka. She got her start in acting with the Moscow Art Theater.         A friend, William Hughes, an actor, said yesterday that her first marriage, to a Russian-born film director, Fedor Ozep, ended in divorce, and that her second husband, Eugene Frenke, a film director and producer to whom she was married in the 1930's, died about five years ago.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980
