         Marie Collins McGuire Thompson, who worked to improve the design of public housing for the elderly and low-income people as the Public Housing Administrator in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died last Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mrs. Thompson was 92 and lived in Kensington, Md.         Marie McGuire, as she was known, came to public housing with an aversion to ''bare, stark shelter'' that, she said, ''has brought no happiness to us.'' Instead, she espoused programs to create homes of which their occupants could be proud. Her advocacy drew criticism from legislators and defenders of traditional approaches, but architectural organizations backed her. Housing projects begun under her leadership won unaccustomed design awards.         She came to national attention as executive director of the San Antonio Housing Authority, where she championed amenities like balconies for every apartment. Studying the special needs of the elderly with limited means, she insisted on features like weatherproof ramps, handrails in all rooms and corridors and emergency bells in the bathrooms.         Her crowning achievement was the Golden Age Center, with 185 low-rent apartments designed for the elderly, that opened in 1960 in San Antonio. The next year, President John F. Kennedy recruited her as the first woman to become Public Housing Administrator. She held the post until 1966, when her office was merged into the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. There she became special assistant to the Secretary, working on housing and problems that affect the disabled and the elderly.         She left the Government in 1972. Until 1982, she was the housing specialist at the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, now the Center for Social Gerontology in Ann Arbor, Mich.         Mrs. Thompson was born in the Georgetown area of Washington. She studied journalism at George Washington University and, years later, studied architecture and real estate management at the University of Houston.         She wrote four books, ''Housing for the Elderly'' (1957), ''Housing and the Disabled'' (1976), ''Housing for the Handicapped'' (1977) and ''Housing for Rural Elderly'' (1982).         Her first marriage, to John McGuire, a Government geologist, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Thomas B. Thompson of San Antonio, an architect, died in 1983. She is survived by a sister, Margaret C. Schweinhaut, also of Kensington.       
         Mary Bancroft, a Boston Brahmin colleen who cut a coquettish swath through 20th-century history, bewitching men of power even as she did brilliant work as an American spy in Switzerland in World War II, died on Jan. 10 at her Fifth Avenue apartment. She was 93.         If Mary Bancroft had not existed, a hack novelist would surely have invented her, or tried.         Dime store fiction could undoubtedly have accommodated her cliche origins as the daughter of a patrician, Harvard-trained lawyer and a distinctly declasse Irish girl, who died in childbirth, setting up her father's marriage to a disapproving, if not quite wicked, stepmother.         He left his daughter to be reared by a paternal grandmother with such a haughty and virulent disdain for the Irish that it was years before Miss Bancroft learned that the woman had herself been an Irish working girl before marrying into the august Bancroft family.         It would have taken a Dickens to invent Nolan, the Bancroft coachman who became Miss Bancroft's constant childhood companion, sharing her delight in the day's news, especially of war and disaster.         And a Dickens could even have contrived for her father's second wife to be the stepdaughter of Clarence Barron, the short, rotund powerhouse owner of The Wall Street Journal who encouraged his step-granddaughter to meet and study people of all walks of life, ''even gamblers and crooks,'' and who gave her what became her credo as a sometime journalist and spy: ''Facts are not the truth but only indicate where the truth may lie.''         A novelist might have foreseen that a daring, restless woman would find Smith College such a bore that she would escape after a year into what turned out to be a stultifying marriage to a teen-age chum and then divorce and seek refuge in another loveless marriage, this time to a Swiss businessman.         But it would have taken a remarkable visionary to have imagined Miss Bancroft's later life as an accomplished spy, a woman with such penetrating intelligence, infallible intuition and boundless verve -- not to mention legs that rarely failed to draw a second glance -- that her intellectual, emotional or romantic conquests included Carl Jung, Woody Allen and Henry R. Luce.         To Jung, the psychologist who became her confidant during her years in Switzerland, her appeal was textbook obvious. In his scheme of things she was an extroverted intuitive, one who had experienced such fierce inter-family battles for her affections as a child that power had become her natural element. She had such an instinctive knack for wielding it, he told her, that men seeking or holding power would cherish her advice, as indeed they did.         Her relationships were often platonic, apparently -- and surprisingly -- including even her postwar fling in New York with Luce, the Time Inc. founder and a legendary ladies' man.         But as her own 1983 book, ''Autobiography of a Spy,'' makes explicit, her wartime romance with Allen Dulles, the American spymaster who laid the groundwork for the Central Intelligence Agency with his brilliant successes in Switzerland in World War II, was as torrid as they come.         At the time, Miss Bancroft's second marriage was beginning to unravel, and Mr. Dulles, whose wife was in the United States, was looking for recruits to interview the hundreds of refugees, adventurers and spies who poured into officially neutral Switzerland from every corner of wartime Europe.         Impressed with the insightful analyses of German articles and speeches she had prepared for one of his associates, he sought her out, quickly concluding that she would be an ideal operative, and more.         ''It should work out very well,'' he blurted out on their second meeting. ''We can let the work cover the romance -- and the romance cover the work.'' The remark might have seemed startling considering that the subject of romance had not been mentioned, but Mr. Dulles was as perceptive as his recruit. The logic appealed to her, and so did he.         In what became a regular routine, she would help him prepare his legendary nightly telephone reports to Washington at his home in Bern, and then the two would engage in what she called ''a bit of dalliance.''         As a spy, she interviewed and sized up visitors from Germany and German-occupied territory, sometimes with startling results. One contact  provided the first inkling that a previously unknown figure named Joseph Broz had become the man to deal with in Yugoslavia, where he was known as Tito.         When her German maid's brother-in-law wrote from the Russian front asking for an aluminum spoon, noting that his wife had told him none was available in Germany, she picked up a critical clue about the war's effects on German production.         By far her most important work was with Hans Bernd Gisevius, a top officer of German military intelligence, who was not only a key figure in a vast plot to kill Hitler and set up a civilian democracy but who, well in advance of what turned out to be a bungled assassination attempt on July 20, 1944, had supplied a manuscript detailing the conspiracy.         Miss Bancroft was entrusted with translating the manuscript into English (Gisevius wanted it published immediately after the coup), but her real job was to make sure he was not a double agent (she concluded he was not) and then to elicit and pass on the detailed information he supplied about the day-to-day shifts of power and strategy within the German Government.         After the war, her daughter said, Miss Bancroft settled in New York, wrote a few novels, lectured on Jung, became active in local Democratic politics, became friends with Woody Allen and became Luce's confidant.         When her daughter, Mary Jane, married Horace Taft, the son of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the wedding pictures were published in Life, -- ''a present from Luce,'' Mrs. Taft said.         In addition to her daughter, of Atlanta, Miss Bancroft is survived by 6 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Ardis Krainik, who in 15 years as general director rescued the Lyric Opera of Chicago from financial peril and established it as a company renowned for its forward-looking programming, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 67.         Ms. Krainik, who had been ill in recent years, announced last June  that she would retire in April. But when her health took a turn for the worse in November, her successor, William Mason, took over as director.         Ms. Krainik was an imposing figure who knew what she wanted for her company and how to get it through inspiration rather than force, although she was not averse to making bold decisions. She made international headlines in 1989, for example, when she announced that Luciano Pavarotti was no longer welcome at the company after he dropped out of a ''Tosca'' production on three weeks' notice. Pointing out that Mr. Pavarotti had bowed out of 26 of his last 41 scheduled appearances at the Lyric, Ms. Krainik said  she was afraid Mr. Pavarotti's unreliability would offend subscribers.         In a way, Ms. Krainik was the personification of the Lyric Opera. She joined the company as a secretary to its founder, Carol Fox, during its first season, and she spent her entire career there. There was little in the company's operation with which she did not have firsthand experience.         A mezzo-soprano who had performing aspirations early on, she sang small roles during her first five years at the company but gave up the stage in 1960 when she was appointed assistant manager. In that job, and later as artistic administrator, she had a hand in everything from pitching in to solve production problems to negotiating artist fees and helping plan seasons. When Fox resigned in 1981, Ms. Krainik was her logical successor.         When she took over the company, it was on the brink of financial collapse. Its endowment had shriveled to $6,000 from nearly $3 million, and cost overruns on an adventurous production of Krzysztof Penderecki's ''Paradise Lost'' in 1978 and on the  elaborate 25th-anniversary celebration in 1979, left the Lyric Opera with a $1.2 million deficit. Ms. Krainik's first task was to restructure the company's operations, cutting $500,000 from its budget in the process.         ''One of the things I did was say no, which had not been done enough in the past,'' Ms. Krainik said in a 1982 interview. ''We gave up space in our building, allowed attrition to run its course, cut back on orchestra rehearsals and did away with all nonessentials. We began to recycle products and borrow stage sets instead of designing all our own.''         She restored the company's fortunes quickly, and by 1993 she had raised much of the money required for a $100 million project to purchase and restore the company's home, the Civic Opera House.         Artistically, too, Ms. Krainik undertook a crucial renovation project. Although the company had always presented contemporary work, she made its commitment to modern opera formal in 1989, when she announced ''Toward the 21st Century,'' a decadelong series that would include two 20th-century operas every season: 10 by American composers, 10 by Europeans, with newly commissioned works along the way.         William Bolcom's ''McTeague,'' Bright Sheng's ''Song of Majnun'' and Bruce Saylor's ''Orpheus Descending'' had their premieres in the series; Shulamit Ran's ''Between Two Worlds'' and Anthony Davis's ''Amistad'' are scheduled for 1997. Other works presented as part of the project include Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' John Corigliano's ''Ghosts of Versailles'' and Carlisle Floyd's ''Susannah.''         Ardis Joan Krainik was born in Manitowoc, Wis., in 1929. She began taking singing lessons when she was 14 and became interested in theater when she got a part in a school play. She continued her musical and theatrical studies at Northwestern University, but her degree was in speech pedagogy.         She taught briefly after her graduation in 1951, but when the Lyric was founded, originally as the Lyric Theater, she joined it as a secretary, chorister and occasional soloist. Her first role was as Rossweisse, a minor Valkyrie in ''Die Walkure,'' in 1956.  She became assistant manager in 1960 and artistic administrator in 1975.         By 1980 Ms. Krainik had grown restless at the Lyric Opera, where her further career prospects seemed limited, and where the dire financial situation had made the company itself unstable. She considered an offer to become general manager of the Australian Opera, in Sydney, and in December 1980 she informed the Lyric Opera board that she would be leaving. But at the same time, Fox resigned because of poor health, and the Lyric Opera board offered the general directorship to Ms. Krainik.         Under her leadership, the company typically presented seven productions each season, but covered a great expanse of the repertory, from Handel operas through newly commissioned works, as well as a complete Wagner ''Ring'' cycle, staged between 1993 and 1996.         She hired fashionable directors and designers, from David Hockney, who designed a production of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' to Robert Wilson, who directed Gluck's ''Alceste'' and Peter Sellars, who presented a controversial, high-tech staging of Wagner's ''Tannhauser'' in which different sets of supertitles conveyed both the actual libretto and Mr. Sellars's notions of the characters' inner motivations.         And although the company always attracted great singers -- Maria Callas sang there during its first season -- Ms. Krainik raised the level of the company's casting. Marilyn Horne, Placido Domingo, Jessye Norman, Kiri Te Kanawa, Jon Vickers, Samuel Ramey, Renee Fleming and Dmitri Hvorostovsky frequented her productions. Many of the opera world's biggest stars turned up to sing at a gala concert in her honor in October.         She is survived by her niece, Barbara Baule of Cedarburg, Wisc., a brother-in-law, J. Edward Mueller, of Dubuque, Iowa, and two nephews, Stephen Mueller of Dallas and Scott Mueller, of Dubuque.         Ms. Krainik was particularly proud of her ''Toward the 21st Century'' series, a program that proved that opera audiences were not thwarted by new works. Every season since the series began, Ms. Krainik proudly reported, was entirely sold out.         ''I want American opera to reach its zenith,'' she said in 1990. ''I think it can blossom in the next 10 years. We have to have our own unique American opera, not just a hashed-over European art form. I think now is the time, and I want to be behind making it flower.         ''I want my audience to be happy with what I do; I want them to have a good time. That's the only hope for American music -- that audiences will love it.''       
         Edith Haisman, the oldest survivor of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, died on Monday night at a nursing home in Southampton, England. She was 100.         Karen Kamuda, the vice president of the Titanic Historical Society, said  in a telephone interview today from Indian Orchard, Mass., that Mrs. Haisman's death left 7 of the 705 survivors still living, 3 in the United States and 2 each in Britain and France.         Mrs. Haisman, who was 15-year-old Edith Brown at the time of the sinking, was the last survivor who was a teen-ager in 1912. The ones who are still alive ranged in age from 9 weeks to 8 years old at the time of the disaster, which claimed more than 1,500 lives.         She was a guest of honor last August on a pilgrimage cruise to the spot 400 miles off the Newfoundland coast where the liner, on its maiden voyage, hit an iceberg on the night of  April 14-15, 1912.         In 1995 she took part in the opening of a memorial garden at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, with a granite monument commemorating the victims, and in 1993 she appeared in public in Southampton to receive a gold watch thought to be her father's from the head of the American company that had salvaged it from the wreckage.         She had last seen the watch protruding from the waistcoat pocket of her father, Thomas William Solomon Brown, 60, a hotel owner from Worcester, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. He was taking his wife, Elizabeth, and his daughter Edith to Seattle, where he intended to open a new hotel. In the hold of the cruise liner were tableware, furnishings and 1,000 rolls of bed linen for the new enterprise.         In a series of interviews in her later years and a biography, ''A Lifetime on the Titanic,'' published in 1995, Mrs. Haisman gave a vivid account of the ship's final moments, although some details have been called into question.         Mrs. Haisman said she remembered that her father was dressed in an Edwardian dinner jacket, stabbing the cold night air with his cigar and sipping from a snifter of brandy on the deck of the listing ship as she and her mother were being winched 70 feet down into a lifeboat.         Mrs. Haisman said that she never forgot the horror of that night and the loss of her father and that even in her later years she suffered nightmares in which she heard the screaming of the drowning victims in the Atlantic. It was 11:40 P.M. when she recalled being jolted in her three-berth stateroom. ''Father appeared a few minutes later,'' she recalled. ''He told us: 'You'd better put on your life jackets and something warm, it's cold on deck. It's just a precaution. We've struck an iceberg -- it's nothing much. The steward in the corridor says it's nothing to worry about.' ''         They hurried through the corridors, leaving behind in their haste her mother's jewelry case, 400 gold sovereigns and a roll of bank notes on top of a bunk. ''We waited for ages on the boat deck for someone to tell us what to do. The ship's band was playing ragtime. They played to keep our spirits up. It was so brave of them. Everybody kept saying: 'She's unsinkable. She won't go down.'         ''Father kissed us and saw us into Lifeboat 14. Up to 50 people got in as it swung perilously over the side. One man jumped into the boat dressed as a woman. As we rowed away from the ship, we could still hear the band playing, but now it was hymns.'' She watched the mighty liner go down.  ''We were almost six hours in the lifeboat and during that time we had  no water and nothing to eat. I kept wondering if my father had got off the ship -- that's all I could think of.''         She and her mother were picked up by the Cunard liner Carpathia and taken to New York, where they left on a train trip to Seattle to spend time with an aunt of Mrs. Haisman's, who lived there and had inspired the move to the West Coast. They soon returned to South Africa, where five years later Edith married Fred Haisman, a shipbuilder's engineering draftsman from London.         Married for 60 years, the couple lived in South Africa, Australia and Southampton, where Mr. Haisman worked in the boatyard. They had 10  children.         Ms. Kamuda, of the Titanic Historical Society, said Mrs. Haisman had ''elaborated'' her story over the years, adding details about what her father was wearing, for example.         ''This is not a criticism of Mrs. Haisman,'' Ms. Kamuda said. ''On the contrary it is only to point out how our memories fail us as time passes and numerous outside influences shape our lives.''         Mrs. Haisman did not share the concern of some survivors and many curators and historians over efforts to salvage mementos from the wreck and to raise parts of the ship itself. The 18-carat pocket watch that she said was her father's had been found in a purser's black leather portmanteau during a dive in 1987.         R. M. S. Titanic of Southport, Conn., the company that exhibits artifacts from the ship and that has drawn charges of exploiting the disaster from Ms. Kamuda and others, had the watch attached to a sterling silver plate inscribed with the words, ''What better use for scientific technology than to reunite a father with his child.'' The chairman of the company, George Tulloch, presented it to Mrs. Haisman in Southampton in December 1993.         By her bed in the nursing home stood a photograph of her father in a straw boater, stiff collar and bowtie.         Mrs. Haisman was born on Oct. 27, 1896. She is survived by four sons, two daughters and more than 30 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Roberts, who directed the Clark Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan, died on Jan. 17 at Bellevue Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         In her nearly three decades of presenting dance, Ms. Roberts helped shape the careers of many fledgling avant-garde and black choreographers who later became major modern dance artists, among them Kei Takei, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and Bill T. Jones. A small, rotund woman with an earthy sense of humor, Ms. Roberts also served as a patient yet eminently practical ''great mother figure,'' as Alvin Ailey put it, to several generations of modern dancers.         A central tenet of her career as a dance producer was that no one should be excluded from dance because of imperfect bodies or the color of their skin. She also believed that dance ought to be available to everyone, whether through the low-cost classes at Clark Center or affordable concerts. She wanted, she said in a 1986 interview, to ''offer people the opportunity to take chances.''         Born in Boston, Ms. Roberts attended Hunter College in Manhattan, graduating in 1931 with a degree in political science. It was during her college years that Ms. Roberts began to study dance seriously, performing  with Blanche Evan. When her husband, Paul Ziporkis, died in 1953, Ms. Roberts was left with a daughter to bring up alone. She worked as a magazine caption writer, an administrator at the Downtown Community School and as the director of the June Taylor School before moving on to Clark Center in 1970.         A friendship with Donald McKayle, a young choreographer, led to her first experience producing dance when Mr. McKayle asked her for help in putting on a concert at the 92d Street Y. Ms. Roberts continued to present dance regularly at Clark Center, where Alvin Ailey had started his company in the 1960's. The center is also where Wendy Wasserstein had the first staged reading of one of her plays.         From 1975 to 1978, Ms. Roberts produced a summer dance festival in the mall at the City College Graduate Center on West 42d Street. Her dreams of moving Clark Center from small, dingy studios on Eighth Avenue to a new theater and studio complex on the West 42d Street Theater Row in the mid-80's were dashed after the city reneged on promised support. Ms. Roberts rebounded with an ambitious eight-week series at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row in 1986, the year she resigned from Clark Center. ''We're going to be dancing on 42d Street,'' she told a reporter. ''I may cry a lot, but that's what we're going to do.'' The Clark Center closed in 1988.         Ms. Roberts was a Capezio Award honoree in 1991 and won a Bessie Award in 1986.         She is survived by a daughter, Karen deFrancis of Brooklyn, and a stepsister, Grace Herman of Manhattan.       
         Raya Garbousova, a cellist who gave the premieres of several contemporary works, including the Samuel Barber Cello Concerto, died on Tuesday at her home in De Kalb, Ill. She was 87.         Miss Garbousova, a formidable musician whose technique was equal to the challenges of such difficult works as Gunther Schuller's unaccompanied ''Fantasy,'' could produce the bittersweet, soaring lyricism that the Barber Concerto requires. Early in her performing career, Pablo Casals, with whom she had studied, declared her ''the best cellist I have ever heard.''         In her later years, Janos Starker, Mstislav Rostropovich and Yo-Yo Ma were among her admirers. Mr. Rostropovich is to give a concert in her honor at the International Cello Congress in St. Petersburg, Russia, in June.         Miss Garbousova was born in Tiflis (now Tbilisi, capital of the former Soviet republic of Georgia) in 1909 and studied at the conservatory there. She continued her studies privately with Casals, Hugo Becker and Felix Salmond. She made her formal debut in Moscow in 1923 and left the Soviet Union two years later. By the late 1920's, she had performed in Berlin, Paris and London, and she gave her first performance in New York City in 1935.         In 1939, she emigrated to the United States. She made many recordings for RCA in the 1940's and edited the published scores of several major cello works.         Composers were quick to recognize her as a champion of new styles. Barber wrote his Concerto for her in 1946; her 1966 recording of the work for the American Decca label has been reissued several times. Karol Rathaus dedicated his ''Rapsodia Notturna'' to her in 1950, and Vittorio Rieti composed a Cello Concerto for her in 1960.         Mr. Schuller wrote his ''Fantasy'' for Miss Garbousova in 1951 and a work in her honor, ''Hommage a Rayechka,'' for cello ensemble, in 1990. She gave the first American performances of works by Hindemith, Prokofiev and Martinu.         Miss Garbousova taught at the Hartt School of Music in West Hartford, Conn., and at Northern Illinois University in De Kalb and gave master classes at many other schools. She is survived by her husband, Kurt Biss; two sons, Paul and Gregory Biss, and six grandchildren.       
         Marlene D. Daniels, a noted expert on maritime law and a partner in the New York law firm of Seward & Kissel, where she headed the maritime finance department, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 55.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, Patricia M. Hynes, a friend, said.         Miss Daniels was a director of the Admiralty/Finance Forum, an organization she co-founded in 1986 to bring together maritime financiers, admiralty lawyers and ship owners to discuss issues affecting the shipping industry.         She also was a member of the Maritime Law Association of the United States and its committees on marine financing and cruise lines, a member of the European Maritime Law Association, the Liberian Shipowners Council and its legal advisory board, and on the executive committee of the board of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce.         She was part of a group of 10 lawyers who in 1992 left the New York firm of Hill, Betts & Nash to join Seward & Kissel. At the time, the group represented more than 30 percent of the lawyers specializing in maritime law at Hill, Betts.         Miss Daniels, a graduate of the Dwight School for Girls, Connecticut College for Women and Fordham Law School, joined Hill, Betts & Nash as an associate in 1967 and was made a partner in 1973.         Born in Englewood, N.J., she was a daughter of the late Joseph H. Daniels, the founder of Palisades Newspapers, a chain of weekly newspapers in Bergen County, N.J.         Miss Daniels is survived by her mother, Eleanor Daniels of Hackensack, N.J., and three sisters, Joanne Daniels Solomon of Manhattan, Bonnie Lee Daniels of Miami and Sheryl Daniels of Hackensack.       
         Herta Lande Seidman, who headed two philanthropic foundations and was a former senior trade official in the Carter Administration, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of pancreatic cancer, her family said. She was 58.         Ms. Seidman, who had lived in Manhattan since 1960, was chairwoman of two philanthropies financed by the investor George Soros: the East-West Management Institute and Soros Management Training Programs. Both organizations teach modern business practices to entrepreneurs and government officials in 21 countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.         Born in 1939 in Cermauti, Romania, Ms. Seidman was one of the very few Romanian Jews who survived the Nazi occupation, escaping confinement in the death camps after her mother bribed a Nazi official, a cousin, Rabbi Moshe Handelsman of Brooklyn, said yesterday.         ''Her mother, Pepi Lande, was a very courageous lady who went up to the colonel of the Gestapo and asked him that he should give her a paper that she and her daughter and her parents should be able to stay and not go to the camps,'' Rabbi Handelsman said.         The colonel approved the request in the summer of 1941 after being given a fur coat and the equivalent of $80,000 in cash.         After the war, the family left Romania, going to Belgium, France and Canada before reaching the United States.         Ms. Seidman got a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Miami in 1959. The following year she earned a master's degree in economics at Cornell University.         She worked on Wall Street in mergers and international trade from 1963 to 1976, when Gov. Hugh Carey appointed her deputy commissioner of the State Department of Commerce and assigned her to attract foreign investment.         In early 1979, on a trip to Russia as a state trade official, family members and friends said, she visited Jewish refuseniks in Kiev and was detained for a day by the K.G.B. in an incident that received wide attention.         In 1980, President Carter appointed Ms. Seidman Assistant Secretary for Trade in the United States Commerce Department, a post she held until 1981.         She then returned to Wall Street, working on commodity and financial transactions, mostly in Eastern Europe and Russia, for Phibro and then Salomon Brothers, until 1986. That year, she became president of the Tradenet Corporation, developing computer finance and training systems.         She became Tradenet's chairwoman in 1990, a post she held while also working as an executive with several Soros foundations.         Ms. Seidman is survived by her husband, Samuel N. Seidman.       
         Ursula Niebuhr, the founder and longtime chairwoman of the department of religion at Barnard College, died on Friday at her home in Stockbridge, Mass. She was 89 and the widow of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.         Although she was clearly upstaged by her renowned husband, who taught at the Union Theological Seminary, Mrs. Niebuhr's own scholarship was so well regarded that in the 1940's she was asked by the president of Barnard to create a department of religion there. She accepted and remained as associate professor and department chairwoman until her retirement two decades later.         A native of Southampton, England, she was sent to Oxford to study at St. Hugh's College, then regarded as little more than a glorified finishing school. She enhanced its reputation considerably when she graduated with honors in history and theology and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York.         When a friend proposed to introduce her to Mr. Niebuhr, a faculty member, she was skeptical, her daughter, Elizabeth Sifton, recalled yesterday. ''Oh, no,'' the friend said, ''you'll love him,'' and she did.         They were married in 1931, embarking on an intellectual and emotional collaboration marked by animated debates that continued until her husband's death in 1971. By then, her daughter noted, their theological differences had dwindled to liturgical quibbles between Mrs. Niebuhr's Episcopalian ideas and her husband's Congregationalist notions.         In the introduction to his last book, Mr. Niebuhr said he could no longer tell where his ideas left off and hers began. After his death, Mrs. Niebuhr returned the favor, editing two collections of his writings.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Mrs. Niebuhr is survived by a son, Richard, of Stockbridge; a sister, Barbara Moravec of Sutton, England, and three grandsons.         Correction:  January 13, 1997, Monday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Ursula Niebuhr, the founder of Barnard College's religion department, misstated the given name of her surviving son. He is Christoper, not Richard.       
         Jean D. Hewitt, a former food writer and home economist for The New York Times and an early advocate of natural foods, died on Sunday in the Bon Secours-Venice Hospital in Venice, Fla. She was 71 and made her home in Venice.         The cause was pneumonia, the family said.         Mrs. Hewitt planned The Times's test kitchen and was in charge of it from its opening in 1969. At the time, a number of newspapers employed home economics graduates as food writers and set up kitchens on the premises to test food and recipes.         In 1971, Mrs. Hewitt made headlines across the country when she tested the recipe for Tricia Nixon's wedding cake. She found the lemon-flavored cake inedible -- ''mush on the outside and soup on the inside'' -- and wrote that it left the oven in a mess. The problem, she decided, was too many egg whites and not enough yolks. She also suggested that the oven temperature be increased and the baking time lengthened.         The White House chef countered by saying that he had forgotten to mention that a collar was required for the pan. Later, however, more corrections were made.         In addition to developing and testing recipes, Mrs. Hewitt wrote a number of New York Times Cook Books, including ''Main Dish,'' ''Heritage'' and ''Weekend.'' Her ''Large Type Cook Book'' and ''New Natural Foods Cook Book'' were forerunners in their respective fields, as was her ''International Meatless Cook Book.'' Four of her books received James Beard Food and Beverage Book Awards.         She joined The Times in 1961 as an assistant to Craig Claiborne, the food editor and restaurant reviewer. In addition to those duties, she researched and wrote about food and reviewed New Jersey restaurants.         In 1975, she was named food editor of Family Circle, a Times Company publication, where she wrote more books, including the ''Family Circle Quick and Easy Menu Cook Book.'' She retired in 1993.         Born in Ipswich, England, in 1925, she moved to New York during World War II, after studying at the Westminster School for Chefs in London. She was a charter member of Les Dames d'Escoffier and a lifetime fellow of the Culinary Institute of America.         Mrs. Hewitt held degrees in food and nutrition from the University of London and Columbia University.         Her first husband, Dr. Eric J. Hewitt, whom she married in 1949, died in 1976. In 1983, she married James Blair of Venice, who survives her. She is also survived by two sons, Gordon Hewitt of Annapolis, Md., and Geoffrey Hewitt of Westfield, N.J.         Correction:  February 14, 1997, Friday         An obituary on Tuesday about Jean D. Hewitt, a former food writer and home economist for The New York Times, referred incorrectly to the opening of The Times's test kitchen. It was opened in 1944; Mrs. Hewitt planned and supervised a major renovation in 1969.       
         Dr. Chien-Shiung Wu, a physicist who performed a historic experiment overturning what had been considered a fundamental law of nature, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her husband, Dr. Luke C. L. Yuan, a retired experimental physicist.         Dr. Wu, the Michael I. Pupin Professor Emeritus of Physics at Columbia University, where she carried out research and taught for 37 years, was known throughout her career as a meticulously accurate experimental physicist who was in demand to put new theories to the test.         In her most famous experiment, announced in 1957, she and her colleagues overthrew a law of symmetry in physics called the principle of conservation of parity that had been considered incontrovertible for 30 years. It held that in nuclear reactions, nature in effect does not differentiate between left and right. At one time, physicists were so certain of the validity of the law that they tried to make all of their observations fit it.         But Dr. Tsung-Dao Lee, also of Columbia, and Dr. Chen Ning Yang of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., suggested that conservation of parity did not hold for interactions between subatomic particles involving the so-called weak force. (One of the four basic forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force plays a role in radioactive decay.)         Dr. Lee consulted with Dr. Wu, an expert in radioactive beta decay, in which an atom emits electrons. Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang suggested an experiment, but Dr. Wu had to find a way to carry it out, an extremely difficult challenge with the technology available at the time.         The experiment used cobalt 60 cooled to 0.01 degree above absolute zero (or minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). Dr. Wu joined forces with a research team at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, which had one of the few laboratories in the country that could chill materials to extremely low temperatures.         The cobalt 60, a radioactive isotope, was placed in a strong electromagnetic field, which made all the cobalt nuclei line up so they spun along the same axis.         Dr. Wu measured what happened when the cobalt nuclei broke down, giving off electrons. She used a device that counted the number of particles that shot out in the direction of the spin and those that did not.         If the law of conservation of parity was correct, the nuclei would give off equal numbers of particles in each direction. But Dr. Wu found that far more particles flew off in the direction opposite the spin of the nuclei, proving that nature differentiates between left and right.         The results were confirmed by other experiments.         Dr. Isador I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate in physics at Columbia, said at the time, ''In a certain sense, a rather complete theoretical structure has been shattered at the base, and we are not sure how the pieces will be put together.''         Dr. Lee and Dr. Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their theoretical work in this area. Dr. Wu did not share the prize, but the playwright Clare Boothe Luce said at the time, ''When Dr. Wu knocked out that principle of parity, she established the principle of parity between men and women.''         Dr. Lee said yesterday, ''C. S. Wu was one of the giants of physics.''         Dr. Wu was born on May 29, 1912, near Shanghai. She received a bachelor's degree from National Central University in Nanjing in 1936 and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1940.         She taught at Smith College and Princeton University before being asked to join the Manhattan Project, the Army's secret project to develop the atomic bomb in World War II. She helped develop a process to enrich uranium ore that produced large quantities of uranium 235, a fuel for the bomb.         As part of the project, an atomic pile was built at Hanford, Wash., in 1942, but its chain reaction stopped a few hours after it was started. The physicist Enrico Fermi suspected that a substance produced by nuclear fission was halting the reaction by capturing most of the neutrons.         He was reportedly told, ''Ask Miss Wu.'' It turned out that a rare gas that she had studied in graduate school was responsible, and the problem was cleared up.         After the war Dr. Wu joined Columbia as a research associate. She was named a full professor in 1958 and was appointed the first Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973.         In her research, she obtained the first successful measurements of low-energy electrons emitted by beta decay, providing experimental evidence for Fermi's theory of weak interactions in the nucleus. She was an author of ''Beta Decay,'' published in 1965, a standard reference for nuclear physicists.         In 1975 Dr. Wu became the first woman to be elected president of the American Physical Society, the chief organization of physicists in the United States. She was also the first woman to receive the Cyrus B. Comstock Award of the National Academy of Sciences and the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate in science from Princeton. The university's president, Robert F. Goheen, said in presenting it in 1958 that Dr. Wu had ''richly earned the right to be called the world's foremost female experimental physicist.''         She also received the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for achievement in science, and the Wolf Prize in physics. Dr. Wu was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh as an honorary fellow.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Vincent Yuan, of Albuquerque, N.M., who is a research scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Alice Huei-Zu Yang, an art historian and curator, died early Saturday morning after a hit-and-run accident at Canal and Varick Streets in Manhattan. She was 35 and lived in TriBeCa.         Ms. Yang's husband, Gerald Szeto, an architect with the firm of Calvin Tsai, was injured in the accident and was in stable condition yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital.         Ms. Yang was born in 1961 in Taipei and came to the United States when she was 15. She studied art history at Yale University, graduating cum laude in 1984. After completing internships in several Manhattan  museums, Ms. Yang worked for five years as an assistant curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, organizing several exhibitions, including a survey of the work of Alfredo Jaar in 1992 and a group show titled ''The Final Frontier'' in 1993. That year, she left the museum to work as a critic and independent curator while earning her master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University.         Ms. Yang had recently passed her oral examinations for a Ph.D. at the institute and last week began working as the Robert Lehman curator at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I. She was also organizing an exhibition of drawings by emerging Taiwanese artists at the Drawing Center in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Yang is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Yang, of Taipei, and two brothers, James, of Hong Kong, and Andrew, also of Taipei.       
         Lael Tucker Wertenbaker, a journalist and author best known for ''Death of a Man,'' her harrowing book about her husband's death, died  on Monday at her home in Keene, N.H. She was 87.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Dr. Christian Wertenbaker.         She began her career at Time magazine in 1938 and reported from Berlin on Hitler and the Nazi party in 1940 and 1941. She recounted with pride that an official of the German propaganda ministry called her ''a dangerous woman.'' After the United States entered the war, she left Germany on one of the last trains out of Berlin. In London, she reported on the activities of exiled European Governments. In 1942, she married Charles Wertenbaker, Time's foreign editor.         The couple later reported from Paris, where they became friends with Ernest Hemingway and Irwin Shaw. Mrs. Wertenbaker left Time in the early 1950's, but the couple remained in France. It was there that Mr. Wertenbaker was told he had  colon cancer, the disease he died of in 1955.         Mrs. Wertenbaker's ''Death of a Man,'' published by Random House in 1957, was described in a review in  The New York Times as a ''high-hearted and unsparing memoir.'' In it, she reported that her last words to her husband, as she pumped painkillers into his arm while he slashed his wrists, were, ''I love you: Please die.''         She said shortly before her death that the book had had the effect she had hoped, easing some of the taboos about dying that existed in the 1950's. ''Death of a Man'' was dramatized for the stage by Garson Kanin. Retitled ''A Gift of Time,'' it opened on Broadway in 1962 with Henry Fonda and Olivia de Havilland playing the Wertenbakers.         Mrs. Wertenbaker wrote 16 other books, both fiction and nonfiction, among them ''The Eye of the Lion,'' a novel based on the life of Mata Hari, published by Little, Brown in 1964, and ''To Mend the Heart,'' a book about cardiac surgery, published by Viking in 1980. She also edited books, wrote articles for Fortune, Life and U.S. News and World Report, and television scripts for the ''20th Century'' documentary series for Walter Cronkite and CBS.         Mrs. Wertenbaker, who had lived in New York City after living in Europe, moved to New Hampshire in 1966. In 1970, she married Bramwell Fletcher, a stage, film and television actor, and they settled in Keene in 1985.         Mrs. Wertenbaker was born in Bradford, Pa., in 1909. She entered the University of Louisville at 16, but never received a formal degree. She was awarded honorary degrees by Keene State College in 1975 and Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., in 1982.         Mr. Fletcher died in 1988. In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Wertenbaker is survived by a daughter, Timberlake Wertenbaker, a playwright who lives in London, and three grandchildren.       
         Marie M. Lambert, who campaigned for Manhattan Surrogate promising to ''clean up the citadel of patronage'' but who retired from the powerful judgeship 12 years later best known as a patronage queen, died on Tuesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan, where she practiced law.         The cause was kidney failure, said her son, Gregory L. Lambert. Her health had deteriorated after heart surgery last fall, he said.         As one of two elected judges of the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, which Fiorello La Guardia described  as ''the most expensive undertaking establishment in the world,'' Surrogate Lambert heard disputes pertaining to wills and estates, and formalized adoptions. She directed the flow of millions of dollars a year by appointing guardians for those too young or too feeble to handle their accounts, designating lawyers to manage wills that had no assigned executor, and awarding legal fees.         From 1977, when she was elected, to 1990, when she retired at the mandatory age of 70, Surrogate Lambert, feared for her quick temper and ability to keep lawyers working in her court till the early morning hours, drew fire.         Democratic Party leaders would not endorse her in the primary campaign, saying she lacked judicial temperament and knowledge of trust and estates law. A judicial conduct commission investigated allegations that she was the most hands-on of fund-raisers for the primary, in which she sent out 300,000 pieces of literature and saturated the city with Lambert paraphernalia. The United States Attorney's office would periodically announce that it was looking at how she gave lucrative work to a cadre of lawyers.         But while shadows remained attached to her name, Surrogate Lambert, a gregarious, street-smart personal injury lawyer who was also the first woman president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, eluded her accusers. Despite the absence of party backing and the disdain of the city's editorial pages, she ran a raw and raucous campaign -- and won. Although investigators recommended she be censured for her unabashed fund-raising, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct declined to take action. And though two lawyers would be prosecuted for activities connected to her, she never faced any charges.         In 1990, an appellate court scolded her as it overturned legal fees she awarded to two lawyers, saying the fees were excessive and that the Surrogate had failed to disclose her friendship with them.         As Surrogate, she ruled over the dying wishes of the very rich and the very famous, a role she relished. Marilyn Monroe's estate marched before her, as did those of Lotte Lenya, Yul Brynner, Lillian Hellman and Joan Crawford. ''Relax,'' she told the actor Al Pacino, when he appeared on a matter. ''Nobody is going to bite you, not if I can help it.''         She was regarded as a judge who could compel rancorous cases to settle by sheer dint of her will. ''If she wanted that result, she would get that result -- legal niceties didn't bother her,'' George DeSipio, a former chairman of the city bar's trust and estates committee, recalled. ''She could be quite nasty if you crossed her the wrong way.''         But Mr. DeSipio, who remained on friendly terms with Surrogate Lambert, said that above all, she was passionate about her job. ''She was a happy judge,'' he said.         In her capacity as Surrogate, she used her authority to help gay partners clarify their inheritance rights. Since homosexuals were not permitted to marry, Surrogate Lambert permitted one partner to adopt the other as a means of guaranteeing inheritance benefits.         But her most infamous task was settling the war over the half-billion dollar estate of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. For four months in 1986, Surrogate Lambert presided over the trial pitting Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his one-time maid and third wife, to whom he had left his estate, and his six children by two former wives.         According to David Margolick, a former reporter for The New York Times who chronicled the case in his book ''Undue Influence,'' Surrogate Lambert badgered and belittled Mrs. Johnson and her lawyers, provoking her to settle the case before it went to a jury.         In another case that raised eyebrows and grabbed headlines, Surrogate Lambert, an Italian immigrant who aggressively sought the support of Jewish voters by vowing not to direct funds to banks that joined in the Arab boycott of Israel, opened an investigation into the Palestine Liberation Organization. A journalist had left 10 percent of his $300,000 estate to the P.L.O. Surrogate Lambert said she could authorize payment to a terrorist group. After hearings in 1982, she ordered the money to be administered through the International Red Cross, to address Palestinian living conditions.         Giusippina Giovanna Maria Macri was born in a small town in the Calabria region of Italy in 1920. Her family settled in Brooklyn nine months later, where her father found work as a barber and her mother as a seamstress. She is survived by her sister, Gloria Diemer, and her brother, Charles Courtright.         She showed intellectual promise and ambition at an early age: Embedded in the family lore is the tale of how the young Marie, told by her grammar school that she could not be valedictorian although she had the academic credentials, hopped the subway, went to City Hall, and had an audience with an Italian compatriot, Mayor La Guardia, who immediately ordered the wrong rectified.         After graduating from Brooklyn College, she attended New York University Law School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1946 she married Grady Lambert, a salesman at Abercrombie & Fitch, who died in 1975.         She tried Wall Street law firms, but left because she was told to specialize in trust and estates law, which she considered ''women's work.'' Instead, she made her mark in the male-dominated world of personal injury law. Hungry and bright, she would take negligence cases that no one else would touch and turn them into winners. Her courtroom manner was disarming: She would shuffle in, legal papers spilling out of shopping bags. Juries considered her one of them.         From the outset of her legal career, she understood the importance of networking: In her later years, she would boast of her friendship with Roy Cohn, who escorted her to President Ronald Reagan's first inaugural ball.         In 1974, the New York State Trial Lawyers elected her president. ''She started her career and ended it on behalf of widows and orphans,'' said Aaron J. Broder, a personal injury lawyer.         In 1990, she reached 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges, and returned to private practice reluctantly. There is a Lambert legend  widely repeated in legal circles, which her son could not confirm but said could well be true. In an effort to extend her term on the bench, it is said, Surrogate Lambert traveled to Italy to check her village church records, to see if her birth date was perhaps incorrect.         Correction:  March 30, 1997, Sunday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Marie M. Lambert, a Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan, omitted a word and thus misstated her position in a case involving a bequest to the Palestine Liberation Organization. She ordered hearings into the purpose of the organization because she said she could not authorize estate payments to terrorists. (The obituary is reprinted today on page 25.)

         Lenore Hershey, a former editor of McCall's magazine and The Ladies' Home Journal, died Thursday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old and a resident of Riverdale, the Bronx. Her daughter, Jane Cuozzo, said the cause of death was complications from Parkinson's disease.         Mrs. Hershey, a graduate of Hunter College, began her career in the promotion department of The New York Herald Tribune and moved to McCall's in 1952. She was executive editor when she left in 1968 to become managing editor of The Ladies' Home Journal. She was appointed editor in 1973, three years after feminists had staged a daylong sit-in demanding that a woman be named editor. In 1981, Mrs. Hershey was named president and editorial director of a new multimedia subsidiary of The Journal's parent company, the Charter Publishing Company.         Mrs. Hershey's seminars on the role of women in the economy led to the creation in 1972 of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Economic Role of Women, on which she served.         Her husband, Dr. Solomon G. Hershey, a professor of anesthesiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died in 1992. She is survived by her daughter, Jane Cuozzo of Manhattan.       
         Judi Bari, an environmentalist whose passionate defense of the California redwoods earned her national prominence and who was injured in a car bombing that might have been related to her protests, died on Sunday at her cabin home in Willits, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bari emerged on the national scene in the summer of 1990. Working with the radical environmental group Earth First, she helped organize a seasonlong campaign of protests to stop the logging of Northern California's old-growth forests.         She and other Earth First members, some outfitted in spotted-owl costumes and camouflage, spent weeks chaining themselves to redwoods and pleading with loggers to spare the groves. In the process, Ms. Bari, a confident orator, helped present a coherent message for a group with a reputation as an overzealous fringe organization.         She called on college students statewide to join the protests, evoking the civil rights spirit that had been used in the summer of 1964 to draw student protesters to the South.         As tensions rose between protesters and loggers, Ms. Bari emerged as a more moderate voice on the environmentalist side. She emphasized that protests opposed the actions of corporations, not their employees, and renounced the use of sabotage methods like ''spiking'' trees with ten-inch nails to destroy saws, which had seriously injured at least one millworker.         Her outspokenness earned her the scorn of many lumber workers, and she received several anonymous death threats.         In May 1990, an explosion ripped through Ms. Bari's car as she and Darryl Cherney, a fellow Earth First member, drove through Oakland, Calif., shortly before planned anti-logging protests. The blast, later determined to have been caused by a nail bomb under the driver's seat, shattered Ms. Bari's pelvis and lower back and left her permanently disabled. Mr. Cherney's injuries were minor.         Shortly after the explosion, while Ms. Bari was still in the hospital, the F.B.I. and local law-enforcement officials put Ms. Bari and Mr. Cherney under arrest, saying they suspected the two had built the bomb. Supporters of the two contended that either the timber industry or Government officials were responsible.         Two months later, the authorities announced that Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari would not be charged with the bombing. They later filed suit against the Government claiming false arrest and civil rights violations. That suit is still in progress in Oakland, Calif.         Ms. Bari was born in Baltimore in 1949. In the late 1960's, as a student at the University of Maryland, she became involved in protests against the Vietnam War and left school.         In the next decade, Ms. Bari held a variety of jobs in the Washington area, where she was also a labor organizer. In the mid-1970's, she planned a successful wildcat strike of workers at a bulk mail office of the United States Postal Service in Washington, as well as failed effort to unionize grocery clerks.         In 1979, she relocated to Northern California, where she worked as a carpenter.         In interviews after the bombing, she recounted how she had a ''environmental epiphany'' one day while working. Admiring a piece of knot-free siding for a house, she said, she wondered aloud whether the wood was old-growth redwood. Her supervisor blithely said it was from a redwood about 1,000 years old.         ''A light bulb went on: We are cutting down old-growth forests to make yuppie houses,'' she said. ''I became obsessed with the forests.''         Ms. Bari is survived by her daughters, Lisa, 16, and Jessica, 11; her parents, Arthur and Ruth Bari, of Silver Spring, Md., and two sisters, Gina Kolata, of Princeton, N.J., a reporter at The New York Times, and Martha Bari of Silver Spring.       
         Ruth Clark, a pollster who left her mark on the newspaper industry with a landmark newspaper study that encouraged editors to offer more information that readers could use in their daily lives and who helped define changing American attitudes on issues from the political to the personal, died on Feb. 20 in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Andrew.         The newspaper study ''Changing Needs of Changing Readers,'' published in 1979, had ''an electrifying effect on the news business,'' said Lee Stinnett, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which commissioned it in an effort to assess why circulation was declining.         The concept, which came to be called ''news you can use,'' appealed to editors nationwide as they experimented with reports on family issues and other articles of a type that they began to refer to as soft news.         Mrs. Clark was also widely known for directing many of the surveys that defined American public opinion during a time of great social and political turmoil in the 1970's, and she was part of the team that introduced exit polls into American politics and journalism.         She had no formal training in marketing or polling. She learned the business on her own, starting as a door-to-door questioner and gradually rising as a survey designer for marketing companies and eventually to prominent positions in the industry. She was a vice president at Louis Harris & Associates in the 1960's, and she was a senior vice president at Yankelovich, Skelly & White until 1983, when she left to start her own firm, Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo.         Arthur H. White, vice chairman of Yankelovich Partners, said that in her surveys Mrs. Clark always made sure she included the opinions of all segments of American society, not just those of the economically comfortable or affluent, because of her  concerns for the downtrodden.         Born Ruth Fine in New York City, Mrs. Clark graduated from Hunter College in 1936. The following year, she married Joseph Clark, who later became the foreign editor of The Daily Worker.         The Clarks moved to the Soviet Union in 1950 but became disillusioned with what they saw there, returning to the United States in 1953, Andrew Clark said. Mr. Clark publicly renounced the Soviet system and left The Daily Worker in 1957.         Mrs. Clark entered the field of market research as an interviewer, going door to door and asking opinions about commercial products, often accompanied by her infant son.         But in 1960, she was ready to move up. She obtained a job with Lou Harris that kept her in the marketing survey segment of the business at first. In 1964, she was part of the Harris team that conducted an exit poll for CBS News in the tightly contested California Republican primary between Nelson A. Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater.         On the basis of the poll's results, Mr. Harris called the race for Mr. Goldwater. He said the two next weeks until the official vote tallies were complete was ''the loneliest time of my entire political career.'' But the official results proved the Harris team right.         Mrs. Clark got a chance to address political issues more broadly when she moved to Yankelovich, Skelly & White around 1970. She was in charge of the firm's public opinion research, and she proved to be adept at turning out high-quality surveys that newspapers and magazines could get into print quickly, Mr. White said.         A survey for the American Cancer Society helped persuade the organization to focus on encouraging nonsmokers to stand up for their rights, said John H. Bartolomeo, a partner in her firm, who also worked with her in the 1970's.         ''She told them that she had picked up an undercurrent of militancy among nonsmokers,'' Mr. Bartolomeo said, ''and she told them that the most important thing they could do would be to encourage that militancy.''         He said that Mrs. Clark, who did not smoke, ''told me once that she considered that the most important thing she had ever done.''         In 1983, Mrs. Clark's daughter Judith, who was in the radical Weather Underground, was convicted of helping to rob a Brink's armored car in Rockland County, N.Y. In that incident in 1981 two police officers and a guard were killed. Judith Clark was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison.         At Yankelovich and at Clark, Martire & Bartolomeo, Mrs. Clark conducted market surveys for many media companies, including The New York Times, The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune.         ''Changing Needs of Changing Readers,'' which Mrs. Clark updated in 1984, was a small study but it helped to change an industry, Mr. Stinnett said. Her influence on newspapers can be seen today in the creation of life style sections, consumer news and entertainment guides published by many newspapers as well as lists of resources for readers that often accompany feature articles.         Besides her son, of Portland, Ore., and her daughter, Mrs. Clark is survived by four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1988.       
         Evelyn Sharp, a New York businesswoman, investor and philanthropist and the head of a hotelier family that owned and managed some of the country's best-known properties, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 94 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         A native of Manhattan, she was attending the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1923 when she married Jesse Sharp, an up-and-coming developer and expert in real estate finance.         Besides keeping up with his ambitious undertakings, she made a name for herself as an interior designer. Among her clients in the 1920's were the Shubert theater chain and her husband's diverse building clients.         By the time he died in 1941, Mr. Sharp had built and owned large apartment houses and a string of fashionable Manhattan hotels, notably the Stanhope, on Fifth Avenue  opposite the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Sharp took charge of the business, selling and buying her own rich portfolio of properties by 1955.         Early on, she sold 14 hotels left by her husband, keeping only the Stanhope, because, she said, ''We built it together, and we raised it like a pet.'' She added the Gotham, the Saranac Inn in Saranac Lake, N.Y., the Beverly Wilshire in Los Angeles and other properties, which she owned and managed.         At one time or another, the Sharp family also had stakes in Delmonico's, the Ritz Tower, the Carlyle, the Beaux Arts and the Paramount Building in Manhattan, and the St. Francis in San Francisco.         Mrs. Sharp took pride in offering gracious service in the European manner. She eventually divested most of her real estate holdings, including the Stanhope, and devoted herself to charities in New York and Los Angeles and to her art collection.         A fancier of School of Paris paintings and sculpture, she exhibited her collection at the Guggenheim Museum in 1978. Later she and her son, Peter Jay Sharp, a developer and owner of the Carlyle, donated the Sharp Gallery in the Metropolitan's 20th-century wing. (He died five years ago.)         In 1952, she endowed the Evelyn Sharp Foundation, which benefits the arts. In 1994, it listed almost $6.3 million in assets as well as grants totaling nearly $300,000, supporting music, dance, the fine and performing arts, museums and art and music education, primarily in New York.         Mrs. Sharp was a 50-year supporter and former board member of Planned Parenthood of New York City, and she helped establish its adolescent services program and Central Harlem Center. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan., for which she built the Sharp House for outpatients. She gave the Evelyn Sharp Laboratory for Nuclear Medicine to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.         She served on the boards of the Lexington Center for the Deaf and of the Associates of the California Institute of Technology. She endowed a graduate fellowship in behavioral biology at the institute and was a founder of the Los Angeles Music Center.         Mrs. Sharp was co-chairman of the Martha Graham Dance Company from 1979 to 1985. She also was a past chairman of La Maison Francaise at New York University.         Mrs. Sharp is survived by a daughter, Mary Sharp Cronson of Manhattan, now the president of the foundation; four grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Thelma Carpenter, whose long roller-coaster career as a singer took her to the heights with the big bands of the 1930's and 40's, out of show business into years as a file clerk and back to the big-time on Broadway in the 60's, was found dead on Thursday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 77.         Detective Thomas A. Frey of the 24th Squad said Ms. Carpenter's death appeared to be the result of natural causes.         ''I'm a singer first, last and always,'' Ms. Carpenter once said.         And indeed she was, from the time she was 7 and asked the manager of a radio ''Kiddies Hour'' for an audition until the end of her life, when she performed at places like Michael's Pub and on ''The Cosby Show.''         At the height of her career, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Carpenter, who combined a bubbling, buoyant personality with a pliant voice and a polished sense of showmanship, sang with such jazz greats as Teddy Wilson, Coleman Hawkins and Count Basie.         On the supper club circuit, she was a soloist at Julius Monk's Ruban Bleu, the Maisonette at the St. Regis and Bon Soir in Greenwich Village.         She made her Broadway debut in 1944 in ''Memphis Bound'' with Bill Robinson, appeared in ''Ankles Away'' with Beatrice Lillie, created the role of Irene Page in ''Bubbling Brown Sugar'' and took on a starring role in ''Dolly!'' in 1968 and 1969, when she became Pearl Bailey's standby and portrayed Dolly Levi more than 100 times.         She performed in such films as ''Hellzapoppin' '' (1941), singing with the Basie orchestra, ''The Wiz'' (1978) and ''The Cotton Club,'' Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film about gangsters and Harlem nightlife.         On radio and television, Ms. Carpenter appeared with Eddie Cantor and Ed Sullivan, was a co-star of the ABC television series ''Barefoot in the Park'' and made guest appearances in everything from ''The Love boat'' to ''The Cosby Show.''         When ''Barefoot in the Park'' was canceled in 1970 after 13 weeks, as when she was out of show business for several years after her mother died in 1962, Ms. Carpenter, while disappointed, refused to turn bitter.         ''My grandaddy taught me something I've never forgotten,'' she said in a 1970 interview. ''What you need is so much more important to you than what you want. Anyway, I've never aspired to be a superstar. You talk about stardom, well, your nose bleeds up there. I got close enough to know. Suddenly there were people I'd never seen, telling me I owed them something. Listen, I've given my money away, where I thought it would help, but I don't want 'yes' people around me. Basically I'm a loner.''         Ms. Carpenter, who left no immediate family survivors, was an only child and never married. ''Yes, I've never married, though you might say,'' she said in 1970, ''that I've done lots of heavy rooming and light housekeeping in my time. Honey, I like life.''         Ms. Carpenter was still a student at Girls' Commercial High School of Brooklyn in 1939 when she was heard by John Hammond, the jazz enthusiast and recording executive who had started Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman and Count Basie on the way to stardom. Mr. Hammond put her on with Teddy Wilson's band at the Famous Door on 52d Street.         Later that year, Coleman Hawkins, the legendary jazz saxophonist, returned to the United States after five years in Europe, formed a band and looked for a singer. ''They make 'em like you in America?'' he asked when he saw Ms. Carpenter. ''You can have the job.''         Ms. Carpenter's career prospered in the United States and abroad, but when her mother died, she said, ''I just lay down in my bed for a whole year.'' Finally, when she needed money, she went looking for a job, applying at a personnel agency that found work as a file clerk at Duffy-Mott, makers of Mott's Applesauce.         When her friend Martha Raye told her there was going to be an all-black company of ''Hello, Dolly!'' Ms. Carpenter went to see the show when Ginger Rogers was playing the lead. ''Son of a gun, I could do that!'' Ms. Carpenter told herself. Pearl Bailey got the role, but when her original standby left, Ms. Carpenter took over the role.         ''I had to go out there and face an audience that had just been told that Pearl Bailey won't be there,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''I decided I was either going to be Dolly or I wasn't going to be Dolly. 'You don't have to pay me,' I felt, 'just applaud me.' And when they'd stand up and cheer, I'd won.''         Correction:  May 30, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the singer Thelma Carpenter on May 17 misidentified the Broadway show in which she appeared with Beatrice Lillie. It was ''Inside U.S.A.,'' not ''Ankles Aweigh.''       
         Anna Scarpova Youskevitch, a prominent ballet teacher and a former member of the Ballets Russes troupes of the 1930's and 40's, died on Thursday at the Broadview Health Facility in West Hartford, Conn. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her daughter, Maria Youskevitch.         Mrs. Youskevitch was the wife of Igor Youskevitch, one of this century's greatest male ballet dancers. Until his death in 1994, they often taught together. Earlier in their careers, they performed together in productions of ''Le Spectre de la Rose,'' Michel Fokine's ballet about a young woman who dreams that the spirit of a rose is dancing for her.         The daughter of a Russian mother and an Italian father, Mrs. Youskevitch, whose original name was Anna Scarpa, was born in Urbino, Italy. But following the balletic fashion of the time, she Russianized her surname. She studied ballet in Rome and Paris and toured Australia and Western Europe, from 1936 to '38, with a group directed by Leon Woizikovsky that served as the second company for the celebrated Ballets Russes directed by Col. W. de Basil.         She met Mr. Youskevitch during these tours. In 1938, the year they were married, they joined Leonide Massine's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She remained with it until 1944, danced on Broadway in the musical comedies ''Sadie Thompson'' (1944) and ''Marinka'' (1945) and then left the dance world to care for her daughter.         In later years, she taught at the Ballet Theater School, the Ballet Russe School, the New York Conservatory of Dance and other New York schools. At the time of her death, she was teaching at the Broadway Dance Center.         She is survived by her daughter, of Hartford, who is a rehearsal assistant for the Hartford Ballet.       
         Queen Mother Moore, a civil rights worker and black nationalist, died on Friday in a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 98 and a longtime resident of Harlem.         Miss Moore, whose real name was Audley Moore, was a hero to many residents of Harlem, where she worked with Marcus Garvey, the Jamaican-born black nationalist leader, and his Back-to-Africa movement. She was also an advocate of reparations for slavery, tenants' rights and education for the poor.         Howard Dodson, the head of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, in Harlem, said in 1995 that her career constituted ''a link between the best elements of the nationalist and radical left political traditions in Harlem over the past five, six decades.''         Miss Moore came to be called Queen Mother during a trip to Africa years ago, when a tribe in Ghana awarded her the honorary title. In Africa, as she once put it, ''I felt the lash on the backs of my people.''         Her outrage over the suffering of blacks in America led to years of political action. ''They not only called us Negroes, they made us Negroes,'' she once said, ''things that don't know where they came from and don't even care that they don't know. Negro is a state of mind, and they massacred our minds.''         Audley Eloise Moore was born in New Iberia, La., a town west of New Orleans. Her family's past reflected the racism she fought: one of her grandfathers was lynched, and one of her grandmothers, a slave, was raped by a white man.         Miss Moore's parents died when she was young, and she dropped out of school, becoming a hairdresser. Largely self-educated, she was inspired by the writings of Frederick Douglass and by Garvey's oratory, which she first heard in New Orleans. She was also fond of Nelson Mandela's dictum, ''The struggle is my life.''         Stirred by Garvey's pride in blacks' African heritage, Miss Moore and her two sisters went to Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. There, she married Frank Warner.         In Harlem, Miss Moore became prominent in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the organization Garvey founded in 1914.         Beginning in the 1960's, Miss Moore was among black leaders demanding reparations from the United States Government for the sufferings of blacks under slavery. In 1994, she addressed a conference in Detroit of the the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, where she declared, in a voice gone soft and husky with age: ''Reparations. Reparations. Keep on. Keep on. We've got to win.''         In 1966, Miss Moore was among parents and civil rights workers who staged a sit-in in the Board of Education's meeting hall in Brooklyn, where the protesters accused board members of neglecting the needs of schools in poor neighborhoods.         Miss Moore said of the district superintendents: ''Run them out. They're perpetuating idiot factories among us.''         In 1989, Miss Moore and more than 40 other prominent black women were honored at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, in Washington, where ''I Dream a World,'' an exhibition of photographs of them by Brian Lanker, was on display.         ''These women are bound by their grit and unquenchable spirit,'' Marion Wright Edelman, a civil rights lawyer and the executive director of the Children's Defense fund, said at the show. ''They lifted the veil of impossibility despite the barriers of race and sex.''         Miss Moore's husband died in 1967. She is survived by a son, Thomas O. Warner of Philadelphia, five grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Dionis Coffin Riggs, a poet, author, newspaper columnist and civic leader who made Martha's Vineyard her home and her passion for the better part of a century, died on April 20 at Cleaveland House, the West Tisbury, Mass., boardinghouse where she had listened to seafaring tales as a child and told them as an old woman. She was 98 and had conducted her regular living room poetry seminar there less than a week before her death.         For someone who graduated from Girls' High School in Brooklyn, spent more than 30 years as a school principal's wife in Jersey City and had a later-life fling with poetry in Turkey, Mrs. Riggs had an uncommon attachment to Martha's Vineyard.         But as a descendant of Athearns, Mayhews, Butlers, Looks and other of the island's first families, Mrs. Riggs, who was born on Martha's Vineyard, in Edgartown, had its history in her blood and its turn-of-the-century sounds in her ears.         To the end of her life, Mrs. Riggs, who could remember when Edgartown's streets were paved with scallop shells, savored the recollected sounds of horses' hooves and wagon wheels crunching down Main Street.         She also had a keen ear for her sea captain grandfather's stories of adventure at sea and calamity at home. As Mrs. Riggs recounted it in her 1940 best seller, ''From Off Island,'' when her 28-year-old grandfather James F. Cleaveland returned from a voyage in 1852 with a 16-year-old Irish Catholic bride from Australia, his mother was not amused.         Indeed, the woman was so unwelcoming to her new daughter-in-law that the young woman talked her husband into taking her along on a five-year voyage. She returned triumphant with two daughters and enough tales to keep her granddaughter, Mrs. Riggs, enthralled for the rest of her life.         It was a family tragedy that gave Mrs. Riggs the opportunity to hear these and other tales firsthand. Her father, Thomas Coffin, a tea taster, left home when she was 3 and never returned, forcing her mother first to open a boardinghouse in Edgartown and later to leave her daughter with her parents to pursue teaching jobs in Pennsylvania and Brooklyn.         By the time Mrs. Riggs joined her mother for her high school years in Brooklyn, she had a fund of stories and a yen to tell them. But it was not until well after she had obtained a teaching certificate in New Jersey and had taught there just long enough to realize she couldn't stand it, that she began to find outlets.         After her 1922 marriage to Sidney Noyes Riggs, who worked as an experimenter with Thomas Edison before becoming a school principal, Mrs. Riggs, an inveterate club woman and volunteer, began writing plays for various women's clubs and later turned out numerous articles on Martha's Vineyard history.         A childhood interest in poetry had been suppressed. Her first effort drew such a bemused reaction from her older sisters, she later recalled, that she wrote no more poems for years. But after entering a poetry contest at the urging of a New Jersey friend and winning a $1 prize, Mrs. Riggs let go with a flood of pent-up poetry.         Her clear, simple and affecting poetic observations so delighted newspaper and magazine editors that she eventually published more than 1,000 poems, many in The Christian Science Monitor and her hometown newspaper, The Vineyard Gazette.         Mrs. Riggs, who always spent summers on Martha's Vineyard, retired there with her husband in 1954, and after his death in 1975 converted the sprawling family home into a bed and breakfast catering to poets.         When she visited a daughter in Turkey, where her son-in-law had been sent by the State Department, Mrs. Riggs became so involved with the local poetry scene that she helped translate hundreds of Turkish poems into English. Her desire to return and continue the work when she was almost 90 was thwarted because she failed to win a Fulbright Fellowship.         Mrs. Riggs, who was long active in virtually every civic organization in West Tisbury, especially enjoyed her weekly readings to schoolchildren (they called her ''cool'') and at a local nursing home, where she was older than her ''elderly'' listeners.         As the West Tisbury correspondent for The Vineyard Gazette, Mrs. Riggs always began her weekly column with a haiku (she enjoyed the challenge) and never overlooked an important event. Her last column, published two days before her death, included the news that a neighbor's goat had given birth to triplets.         She is survived by three daughters, Alvida Jones, Ann Fielder and Cynthia Riggs, all of West Tisbury; 14 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren.       
         Rose Will Monroe, an employee of an aircraft factory who, through a chance meeting with a Hollywood star, became the celebrated ''Rosie the Riveter'' in World War II, died on Saturday in Clarksville, Ind. She was 77, and a resident of Clarksville.         Mrs. Monroe's remaining kidney began to fail two years ago, and that led to her death, her family said.         The Rosie character depicted in the widely distributed poster by J. Howard Miller became a patriotic depiction of working women, but the image itself was fictional. Mrs. Monroe appeared in a promotional film for war bonds after Walter Pidgeon, the actor, discovered her at an aircraft parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich., said Mrs. Monroe's daughter, Vicki Jarvis of Clarksville.         Mr. Pidgeon had gone to the Willow Run Aircraft Factory to appear in the promotional film and found out that there was a woman named Rose who was a riveter, Mrs. Jarvis said. The song ''Rosie the Riveter'' by Kay Kyser, inspired by a Long Island woman named Rosalind P. Walter, was already a hit. And the poster, with the title ''We Can Do It'' above a painting of a muscle-flexing woman in a bandanna and overalls, was becoming a worldwide symbol of women in the defense industry in World War II. A real Rosie the Riveter, Mrs. Jarvis said, proved too good for the film's producers to resist.         ''Mom happened to be in the right place at the right time,'' Mrs. Jarvis said yesterday.         Indeed, Mrs. Monroe was the quintessential wartime mother, said Mrs. Jarvis, who had not yet been born when her mother took the job at Willow Run in the early 1940's. Left with two young children after her husband was killed in a car accident, Mrs. Monroe, like millions of other women nationwide, joined the work force both to fulfill a call to arms, so to speak, and to support her family.         ''They couldn't find a better role model, to be honest,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ''Everything she does, she does well. She makes it very tough for the rest of us to follow in her footsteps.''         Even before she became a riveter, Mrs. Monroe had proven herself while growing up in Somerset, Ky., her daughter said. ''There were nine brothers and sisters,'' she said. ''She was the one who was a tomboy who could use tools. She could do everything.''         Despite her brief fame as Rosie the Riveter in the film, which was shown in theaters between features to encourage viewers to buy war bonds, Mrs. Monroe never capitalized on the role, Mrs. Jarvis said. She remained a tireless worker after the war, driving a cab, operating a beauty shop and founding Rose Builders, a construction company that specialized in luxury homes, her daughter said.         ''My mother was the type of person who never believed in government assistance,'' Mrs. Jarvis said.         During the war, Mrs. Monroe had hoped to be among the women chosen to learn to fly and transport aircraft parts around the nation, but she was passed over because she was a single mother, Mrs. Jarvis said. But Mrs. Monroe achieved her lifelong dream of becoming a pilot when she was in her 50's.         ''She was a member of the local aeronautics club -- the only female member, of course,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ''She was quite a good pilot. She taught me how to fly.''         But Mrs. Monroe's love of flying resulted in an accident in 1978 that contributed to her death 19 years later. Out for an afternoon flight with her daughter and four other people, Mrs. Monroe's small propeller plane stalled on takeoff and plunged to the ground. While the passengers were not seriously hurt, Mrs. Monroe lost a kidney and the vision in her left eye, which ended her career as a solo pilot.         In addition to Mrs. Jarvis, Mrs. Monroe is survived by another daughter, Connie Gibson, of Clarksville; six sisters, Vera Gastineau and Lelia Stiers of Lafayette, Ind., Gladys Jones of Merritt Island, Fla., Eula Stone of Jeffersontown, Ky., Flonnie Cope of Lake Worth, Fla., and Christine Witt of Port Clinton, Ohio; nine grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary D. Keyserling, an economist who made women and children the focus of her work in and out of government, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in McLean, Va. She was 87 and had been director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau during the era of feminist ferment in the 1960's.         Her brother, Dr. Thomas D. Dublin of Washington, said the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease.         By 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to head the Women's Bureau, Dr. Keyserling had established herself as a leading economist and as a champion of economic opportunities for women.         She was also something of a Washington insider: the wife of Leon H. Keyserling, a prominent economist who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Harry S. Truman, and a woman of accomplishment with a wide circle of influential friends.         She had worked closely with Eleanor Roosevelt as chief of the research and statistics division of the Office of Civilian Defense in World War II, and with W.  Averell Harriman as chief of the Commerce Department's international economics division from 1946 to 1953.         Dr. Keyserling was a onetime president of the Women's National Democratic Club.         She also ran the District of Columbia Commission on the Status of Women and advised the National Academy of Sciences on child development, working on issues that had been a major concern since she was a child.         Dr. Keyserling's mother had been a college-trained social worker, and her father was a statistician and vice president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.         As a girl growing up in Manhattan and on a farm in Westchester County, Dr. Keyserling weighed the rival parental influences, then blithely chose to follow both at once by becoming an economist specializing in social issues, like the sometimes high prices paid by consumers and the often low wages earned by women.         After graduating from Barnard College, where she was president of her senior class, she did graduate work at the Geneva School of International Studies and the London School of Economics before to New York. It was at Columbia University that she caught the eye of Mr. Keyserling, a young economics instructor. They were married in 1940, when she was 30.         As a Government economist in an era when the New Deal had attracted droves of women to high-level Federal positions, Dr. Keyserling had a lot of company in the corridors of power. But it was a tribute to her prominence that when the prestigious Cosmos Club in Washington finally deigned to admit women in 1988, she was one of the first 18 women to join.         As director of the Women's Bureau until 1969, Dr. Keyserling was in the forefront of efforts to obtain and enforce Federal legislation banning sex discrimination in employment.         It was a task that had its surreal moments, like the time she participated in a White House conference whose major concern seemed to be whether Playboy clubs would be forced to hire men as ''bunnies.''         For all her official accomplishments, Dr. Keyserling may have made her most powerful impact on social policy after she left the Government. She supervised a vast study of commercial day-care operations for the National Council of Jewish Women, producing a highly critical 1972 report, ''Window on Day Care,'' that became the national blueprint for changes in such programs.         Besides her brother, she is survived by another brother, Amos Dublin of Norwich, Vt. Her husband died in 1987.       
         Edythe Meserand, who was one of the first women to become a radio news executive, died on Monday at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.. She was 88.         Ms. Meserand began her career in 1926 in the press department of the National Broadcasting Company, which had been newly formed from WJZ and WEAF. It was a period when women were in policy-making positions at NBC, and Ms. Meserand was a protegee of Margaret Cuthbert, director of talks, and Bertha Brainard, director of programming.         In 1931 she went to work for the Hearst radio stations. She was the director of promotions for the 10 Hearst stations, and the ''Musical Clock Girl'' on WGBS, the station that was the forerunner of WINS in New York City. Her job was to announce the time of day, play music and deliver the news.         She left Hearst in 1937 and became assistant news director of WOR, making her one of the first women in radio to assign reporters and shape the news broadcast. At that time, news was part of the station's publicity department. When World War II came, WOR lacked a news department and appropriate facilities for radio transmissions. Ms. Meserand helped design what was considered the first modern radio newsroom. While at WOR, she also produced some of radio's first news documentaries using realistic background sound.         During World War II, when her boss, David Driscoll, became a war correspondent, Ms. Meserand took over the department.         She was born in 1908 in Philadelphia and grew in up in the Bronx and on Long Island.         She received a number of honors and awards for her work, and in 1951 became a founder of American Women in Radio and Television, serving as its first president.         As WOR began to move into television, Ms. Meserand produced programs in that medium for the station. She retired from WOR in 1952 and moved to a tree farm in Charleston, N.Y. There, she started an advertising agency and managed radio and television campaigns for Mary Anne Krupsak, former Lieutenant Governor of New York.         In 1976, Ms. Meserand was honored by the Northeast Area Conference of American Women in Radio and Television for her 50 years in the industry. During her years in Charleston, she also founded the Charleston Historical Society to save the town's First Baptist Church, built during the presidency of George Washington.         She is survived by her companion, Jane Barton, and a sister, Mary Miserendino of Convent Station, N.J.       
         Madelon DeVoe Talley, an investment manager who was one of Wall Street's first female executives, died Friday in a car accident near Wyndam, N.Y., her husband, Truman M. Talley, said. She was 65.         Despite a longtime interest in finance, Mrs. Talley did not begin her career until 1969, when she was in her late 30's and in the midst of raising three children.         In his book ''The Go-Go Years,'' an account of Wall Street during the 1960's, the author John Brooks said Mrs. Talley was a ''New York housewife who had tired of full-time housewifery,'' when she took a job as an assistant analyst at the Dreyfus Corporation.         A year later, she was named co-manager of the Dreyfus Leverage Fund, a promotion that made her the first female fund manager on Wall Street.         During her tenure at Dreyfus, which lasted until 1977, Mrs. Talley managed several funds, was a member of the firm's executive committee and earned a reputation as one of the sharper financial minds around.         During that period she also received a B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College.         ''She had a lot of energy, talent and ability in the field, and did very well,'' said Howard Stein, the retired chairman of Dreyfus.         Mrs. Talley left Dreyfus to develop programs for the American Women's Economic Development Corporation, a joint venture of the Small Business Administration and the Commerce Department that aids women entrepreneurs.         Mrs. Talley said she took the job to hone her interest in small business rather than further an interest in business.         ''Everybody in my family has started his own business,'' she said in a 1979 interview.         ''My father-in-law started a paperback book company; my father started two businesses on Wall Street, and my grandfather started two businesses in Hoboken.''         The call of the investment world was strong, however, and seven months after taking on her new position Mrs. Talley returned to it.         In February 1979 she was appointed New York State's director of the division of investments and cash management, a job that included the management of the state's $16 billion common retirement fund.         ''Madelon Talley set the procedures and processes for the retirement funds, so that when the markets started to rise in 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 800, we were set,'' said Edward V. Regan, the former New York State Controller who hired her. ''It was a very, very major contribution.''         Mrs. Talley kept her Albany job until June 1982, when she left to join Rothschild Inc. as president of its asset management unit. She held the post for two years, leaving to set up a hedge investment fund for private investors.         In the last decade, Mrs. Talley devoted much of her time to writing about investing and serving on various boards.         From 1993 to 1995, she served as a governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers. In 1995, she was appointed a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She wrote two books and numerous articles for a variety of publications.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Talley was vice chairman of W. P. Carey & Company, a real estate concern, a member of Alliance Capital Management's International Advisory Committee and a member of the board of the Joffrey Ballet.         ''She knew our business as a customer and a vendor, and she did a great job for New York State by getting the state heavily into stocks in the early 1980's, which was the right thing to do,'' said Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital.         A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Talley was a 10th-generation New Yorker, her forebears having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine in the mid-17th century.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Talley is survived by a son, MacDonald W. Talley of Pacific Grove, Calif.; two daughters, Melanie Talley Whately and Marina Talley, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. of Sea Girt, N.J.       
         Alexandra Danilova, an internationally popular ballet star known for her vivacity and theatrical flair, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Beloved by audiences in a performing career that extended from the Imperial Russian Ballet of St. Petersburg to Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes of the 1920's and the various Ballets Russes companies that succeeded it, Miss Danilova was also a noted teacher and for many years a faculty member of the School of American Ballet, the New York City Ballet's school.         She was known to friends by the nickname Choura, and admired for her Champagne-like sparkle and a stage presence so intense that she could command attention even when she was not moving. With her heart-shaped face and dark brown hair, she was striking to behold. She was also celebrated for possessing what were considered the most beautiful -- and photogenic -- legs in ballet. Lincoln Kirstein, the New York City Ballet's director, once called them ''legs like luminous wax.''         Yet Miss Danilova did more than personify glamour. Extraordinarily versatile, she danced roles that ranged from the passionate Swan Queen in ''Swan Lake'' to the mischievous Swanilda in ''Coppelia'' and the worldly heroines of Leonide Massine's balletic comedies, ''Le Beau Danube'' and ''Gaite Parisienne.'' Although she particularly enjoyed dramatic roles, she also danced abstract ballets. George Balanchine, her schoolmate from St. Petersburg, created ''Danses Concertantes'' in 1944 for her and for Frederic Franklin, the English-born dancer who was her partner at the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from the late 1930's through the 50's.         She appeared in many experimental productions, including, in the Soviet Union, Fyodor Lopukhov's ''Dance Symphony'' of 1923, among the first abstract symphonic ballets. Artistically inquisitive, Miss Danilova once said: ''I have been so lucky. All my life I have worked with the avant-garde. That developed me enormously as an artist, much more than if I had danced just 'Swan Lake' and 'Giselle.' ''         She was born in Peterhof, Russia, near St. Petersburg, on Nov. 20, 1903, and orphaned when she was a small child. She was brought up by relatives and foster parents. When they discovered that the little girl loved to dance, they wondered if there might be a career in ballet for her, and she was accepted by the Imperial Ballet School in 1911. In 1920, she entered the Maryinsky Ballet, the company now known as the Kirov Ballet.         As a young dancer, she was caught up in the artistic ferment after the Bolshevik Revolution. Not only did she appear in the experiments of Lopukhov, but she also became a friend of Balanchine, at that time an experimental young choreographer. Along with several other dancers, she and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924 on what was intended to be a tour of Western Europe. But that same year, she and Balanchine were accepted by Diaghilev: Miss Danilova as a dancer, Balanchine as a choreographer.         Until 1931, she and Balanchine lived together as husband and wife, although they were never married. Balanchine was still officially married to another dancer, Tamara Geva, and he told Miss Danilova that because his marriage papers had been left behind in Russia, he feared it might be difficult to arrange a legal separation.         When Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Danilova said she felt as if the ground had collapsed beneath her feet. A few years later, however, she danced with the Ballets Russes, which Col. W. de Basil organized in 1933 as a successor to the Diaghilev company. In 1938, she became prima ballerina of a rival company, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, in part because its resident choreographer was Massine, whom she admired only slightly less than Balanchine. The coming of World War II turned the Ballet Russe into an American company and, often partnered by Mr. Franklin, she toured across the country until the early 1950's, appearing in the classics, in ballets by Massine and in works by other choreographers, including Balanchine.         Miss Danilova, who became an American citizen in 1946, was twice married, to Giuseppe Massera in 1934 and to Casimir Kokitch in 1941. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Miss Danilova said in ''Choura,'' her autobiography, which was published in 1986: ''I sacrificed marriage, children and country to be a ballerina, and there was never any misunderstanding on my part: I knew the price.''         She also wrote, ''In a way I regard American audiences as my children, because I helped to educate them.''         Many dancegoers who saw her with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo would agree to that. Miss Danilova gained the reputation of being an artist who was never slack and who gave one-night appearances in tiny villages the same loving care that she bestowed upon seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.         ''I never danced for an audience that I thought was unworthy of my performance,'' she once declared. She said she believed that a ballerina should always be glamorous, onstage or off. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''Every woman has an image -- mother, princess, ballerina -- that she must uphold. I was privileged to be a ballerina and I, therefore, had a duty to my audience. They must never be disappointed in me.''         Miss Danilova was often in demand as a guest teacher around the country. She also coached works from the classical repertory, and in 1974, she and Balanchine staged ''Coppelia'' for the New York City Ballet. She appeared on Broadway in ''Song of Norway'' in 1944 and ''Oh, Captain'' in 1958 and in the movie ''The Turning Point'' in 1976. In 1958, she received the Capezio Award.         No immediate family members survive. A funeral service for Miss Danilova will be held at 5 P.M. on Thursday at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.         Although she was long reluctant to return to Russia, Lewis Ufland, her former manager, said yesterday that Miss Danilova did go back several years ago. She visited St. Petersburg as part of the trip, and was able to attend graduation performances at the Kirov School, the former Imperial Ballet School she had attended as a child. The faculty enthusiastically welcomed her as one of that institution's greatest alumnae.       
         Jeanne Calment, born a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented his telephone and 14 years before Alexandre Gustave Eiffel built his tower, died today in a nursing home in Arles. At 122, she was the oldest person whose age had been verified by official documents.         Jean-Marie Robine, a public health researcher who is one of the authors of a book about Mrs. Calment, said she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month ago.         The French, who celebrated her as the doyenne of humanity, had their own theories about why she lived so long, noting that she used to eat more than two pounds of chocolate a week and treat her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking five years ago.         Longevity ran in the family; Mrs. Calment's mother lived until she was 86 and her father until he was 93. But Mr. Robine said her great strength was her unflappability.         ''I think she was someone who, constitutionally and biologically speaking, was immune to stress,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''She once said, 'If you can't do anything about it, don't worry about it.' ''         Jeanne Louise Calment's claim to fame is the Feb. 21, 1875, listing in the birth register in Arles, the southern French city where she began her days and ended them.         She was 12 or 13 when she saw Vincent Van Gogh in Arles, and she said later that he was ''very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick -- I forgive him, they called him loco.''         She married a cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment, in 1896. As the prosperous owner of a store in Arles, he was able to support her in style, and she never had to work. She played tennis, took up roller skating, bicycling and swimming and took great pleasure in joining the hunting parties he organized. She also studied the piano and enjoyed the opera.         Her husband, 46 when World War I broke out, was too old for military service. His business survived the Depression, but a dessert of spoiled preserved cherries killed him, but not his wife, in 1942.         They had one child, a daughter, Yvonne, whose marriage to Joseph Billot produced a single child, Frederic Billot, in 1926. Eight years later, Yvonne died of pneumonia, and Mrs. Calment raised her grandson in the family home. He became a medical doctor and died before her, in an automobile accident in 1960.         Mrs. Calment rode a bicycle until she was 100 and walked all over Arles to thank those who congratulated her on her birthday that year.         At age 110 her increasing frailty forced her to move into a nursing home. ''She complained about the food in the nursing home, which was sort of like baby food,'' Mr. Robine said today. ''She said it always tasted the same.''         At the age of 115, she fell and fractured two bones, and her memory began to fail. But she retained a tart wit. ''When you're 117, you see if you remember everything!'' she rebuked an interviewer five years ago. When somebody took leave by telling her, ''Until next year, perhaps,'' she retorted: ''I don't see why not! You don't look so bad to me.''         By the time she turned 122, she was so hard of hearing that it was difficult to communicate with her.         The name of the person who has taken Mrs. Calment's place as oldest living human was a topic of considerable international confusion today. Philip Littlemore of the Guinness Book of World Records in London said the oldest known person whose date of birth was as well documented as Mrs. Calment's was Lucy Askew, a British woman who turned 104 last Sept. 8. But several others may also have claim to the title, including at least one in the United States.         Mrs. Calment left no heirs. She also outlived Andre-Francois Raffray, a lawyer who 32 years ago, when she was merely 90, bought the apartment she used to live in on a contingency contract. He would pay her 2,500 francs (now about $400) a month until she died, and then the apartment would become his.         Mr. Raffray died a year ago at 77, after paying Mrs. Calment more than $180,000, better than double the apartment's market value. His family was still paying when she died.         ''In life, one sometimes makes bad deals,'' Mrs. Calment said.         Mr. Raffray's widow, Huguette, told French radio tonight: ''She was a personality. My husband had very good relations with Mrs. Calment.''         Michel Vauzelle, the Mayor of Arles, said: ''She was Jeanne the Arlesienne, one whose picture went around the world. But above all, she was the living memory of our city.''         She may be most famous in France for her many bons mots. One of them was: ''I've never had but one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.''       
         Hallie Crawford Stillwell, who drove a covered wagon into Alpine, Tex., in 1910, worked as a teacher and then settled down and became a Big Bend legend as a sharp-shooting ranch wife on horseback, died on Monday at an Alpine hospital, two months and two days shy of her 100th birthday.         As a rough rancher, chatty newspaper columnist, justice of the peace, chili cook-off queen and mistress of a museum devoted to her life, Mrs. Stillwell, who was known as Miss Hallie far beyond the sweeping curve of the Rio Grande, became a Texas tourist attraction.         A native of Waco whose restless father kept the family on the move, including three years homesteading in the New Mexico Territory, she was 13 when she hitched up a four-horse team, gathered the reins and led a Conestoga convoy that took her family to the dusty little town of Alpine in the Big Bend region of southwestern Texas.         Six years later she received a teaching certificate, strapped on a six-shooter and set out for the town of Presidio on the Rio Grande, a major crossing point for Pancho Villa's raiders. When her father accused her of going off on a wild goose chase, she stood her ground. ''I'll gather my geese,'' she said, a retort that established her independence and provided the title for an autobiography.         After a year of dodging Mexican raiding parties and fending off drunken American soldiers, she took a safer position in Marathon, some distance from the border. Her father was relieved, until she decided to marry Roy Stillwell.         Though Mr. Stillwell owned a 22,000-acre spread 45 miles south of Marathon, he was a taciturn, hard-drinking, poker-playing widower more than twice her age. He may not have seemed a suitable husband, but the first time he drove up in his sporty Hudson Super Six, she later explained, ''He decided he liked me, and I decided I liked that car.''         Assuring her father that ''I'd rather be an old man's darlin' than a young man's slave,'' she married Mr. Stillwell in 1918. She was 20 and he was 40.         After a honeymoon in San Antonio, Mr. Stillwell, whose first wife had not been the ranching sort and had lived in town, took his bride home and proudly showed off the 12-by-16-foot one-room cabin where he had lived for years with three crusty and decidedly misogynist ranch hands.         Meager as it was, the cabin had all the comforts of a bridal home except an actual bed. The couple slept on a bedroll on the floor, and Mrs. Stillwell had to be up and dressed by dawn to avoid being trampled by the cowboys trooping in to fix breakfast.         The hands, miffed enough at being displaced to the barn, were not about to let a woman meddle in the manly work of cowboy cooking. As it happened, they did not mind her performing such ladylike chores as riding herd on the cattle, wrestling calves to the ground for branding and shooting deer and other game for the table, especially after they discovered that she was a better shot than they were.         Not that they had any choice. Because the ranch was only 23 miles from the border and well within bandito-raiding range, it was considered unsafe to leave her home alone even though her husband kept a rifle in each corner of the house.         One day, after she proved her prowess as a marksman, Mrs. Stillwell, who rode with a .45 strapped to her waist and a 30.06 rifle slung across her saddle horn, was allowed to stay behind. It proved to be a disaster. Responding to some pent-up urge, she spent the day scrubbing an accumulation of charcoal graffiti off the cabin walls and used sand to scour the coffeepot until it gleamed inside and out.         After the cowboys returned and discovered that she had erased years of ranch records, they never let her forget it. ''Washed any walls lately?'' they would ask. They were more distressed at what she had done to their lovingly seasoned coffeepot. The coffee, they reminded her for years, was not fit to drink for six months.         As the babies started coming, a couple of bedrooms were added, and while her three children were in school, Mrs. Stillwell would even spend the week in town, but on weekends and in summers she continued to ride with her husband.         After her husband died in 1948, she soldiered on alone until 1964, when she turned the ranch over to her two sons and moved to Alpine, where she became justice of the peace for the Connecticut-sized Brewster County.         The work included serving as coroner, a job, she noted, she had mastered by observation as a teen-ager after watching a sheriff and his deputy cut down a challenger in a gunfight. Soon, she said, a man in a black coat strode up, took one look at the bloody remains, said, ''He's dead,'' then whirled on his heel and left.         In recent years, Mrs. Stillwell had lived in a mobile home on the edge of the ranch where her daughter established a park for recreational vehicles with a replica of the cabin room she lived in as a bride in the 1920's.         In addition to regaling tourists, she worked on a sequel to ''I'll Gather My Geese,'' her autobiography. Now being completed by a granddaughter, it is titled, ''My Goose Is Cooked.''         Mrs. Stillwell is survived by two sons, Roy and Guy, and a daughter, Dadie, all of the Big Bend region; a sister, Glen Harris of Presidio; 9 grandchildren; 15 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Halle, a glamorous Cleveland department store heiress who cut a heady swath through the 20th century firmament, befriending and bewitching luminaries on both sides of the Atlantic and serving as a perceptive gadfly in politics, society and the arts, died on Aug. 7 at her home in Washington. She was 93.         During a remarkable life in which she formed enduring intimate relationships with George Gershwin, Randolph Churchill, W. Averell Harriman, Joseph P. Kennedy, Walter Lippmann, Buckminster Fuller and scores of other diverse figures, Miss Halle demonstrated such a flair for friendship and a knack for bringing people together that it is a wonder she found time for anything else.         She had a creditable enough career in journalism and with American intelligence in World War II. But Miss Halle, who wrote for The Cleveland Plain Dealer and other publications, conducted radio interviews with public figures and provided intermission commentary for Cleveland Orchestra broadcasts, was at her best in private settings.         A tall, slender, blonde beauty who kept her youthful good looks well beyond middle age and whose infectious enthusiasm continued long after that, Miss Halle (pronounced HAL-ee) once showed a friend a list of 64 men who had proposed to her, among them a youthful Randolph Churchill and an aging Averell Harriman.         (For all her reputation as a femme fatale, the ''Mata Halle'' nickname that William J. Donovan pinned on her during her years with his wartime Office of Strategic Services was more pun than analogy to the World War I seductress.)         Given the range and ardor of her admirers, one of Miss Halle's more notable achievements may have been avoiding marriage and thriving in an era when even independently wealthy spinsters were viewed with suspicion.         Seeking safety in numbers, she became famous for surprising wealthy suitors by showing up for dinner dates with several less well-heeled admirers in tow.         Even more notable was the fact that she remained on such good terms with her spurned suitors. Thirty years and two marriages after he was first rejected, for example, Mr. Churchill was still as devoted to her as ever.         That was partly because Miss Halle was such an attentive listener that she could repeat entire conversations verbatim, making her a reliable and entertaining gossip.         For all that, she had such a passion for discretion that long after most of her paramours were dead, including those who had not been free to propose marriage, she refused all entreaties to write her memoirs. Even intimates who are certain, for example, that she had been Joseph Kennedy's favorite mistress cannot say for sure whether her friendship with Gershwin, who wrote her gushing letters, had been a full-fledged romance.         A product of a fairy-tale union between a wealthy German-Jewish merchant and an Irish-Catholic working girl, Miss Halle, whose father was a founder of the old Halle Brothers department store in Cleveland, grew up in an ecumenical, intellectually charged atmosphere that left her without prejudice or pretension and with an eclectic range of interests, especially in people.         Her survivors include a sister, Ann Little of Chagrin Falls, Ohio.         Making the most of her family connections and even more of those she formed on her own, Miss Halle got her start in political society early. During a family visit to Washington when she was 13, President Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, a former Cleveland mayor, had a young assistant, Walter Lippmann, show her around. He got her admitted to a special session of Congress, making her perhaps the last person alive to have witnessed Wilson's request for a declaration of war in April 1917.         Later, after one boring year at Smith College, Miss Halle took New York by storm, captivating Gershwin and making her apartment a headquarters of the roaring 20's.         She broadened her scope considerably after Randolph Churchill gave a speech in Cleveland in 1931 and fell in love with her. Although Miss Halle, who was eight years older than he was, kept him at bay, she became a frequent visitor to Chartwell, the Churchill country home in England, and a favorite of his father, Sir Winston Churchill.         As a result, Miss Halle, who was an old friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt and campaigned for him in 1932, became one of the few people to be on intimate family terms with the two wartime leaders.         Miss Halle, who made Washington her base after World War II, became such a Churchill enthusiast that she published two volumes of his collected sayings and was credited with using her considerable drawing room influence to persuade Congress to confer the honorary American citizenship that he considered his most prized public tribute.       
         Myra Tanner Weiss, an unlikely Trotskyist whose radical vision of an egalitarian, collectivist society led her to organize migrant farm workers, rail against racism, make two quixotic mayoral races in Los Angeles and run for Vice President of the United States three times on the Socialist Workers Party ticket, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Indio, Calif. She was 80.         At first glance, Mrs. Weiss would hardly seem the type to be attracted to Leon Trotsky's version of Marxism, and not simply because she cut a stylish figure in leftist circles -- a small, attractive woman who was always immaculately turned out, generally in a well-cut suit of lush material run up by her husband's tailoring family.         Mrs. Weiss, who was on the Socialist Workers Party's national ticket in 1952, 1956 and 1960, was the daughter of an unabashed capitalist, Myron Tanner, who managed an investment syndicate before becoming a top insurance salesman in Los Angeles. And her roots were in Salt Lake City, a decidedly conservative city whose politics, customs and thinking tended to reflect the the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.         But by the time she joined the Socialist Workers Party while attending the University of Utah in 1935, her family had already distanced itself from the Mormon Church. Her grandfather, Joseph Marion Tanner, an educator who was president of Utah State University, became so distraught when the church discontinued its doctrine of polygamy in 1890, bowing to a Supreme Court ruling that polygamy was not a permissible exercise of religious freedom, that he abandoned his six wives and fled to Canada.         Almost from the beginning, Mrs. Weiss was in the forefront of the socialist movement. Dropping out of college to follow her family to California, she took courses at the University of California at Los Angeles, but she soon left college, first to organize agriculture and cannery workers and later to help establish the Socialist Workers Party in Los Angeles, where she and another party organizer, Murry Weiss, began a romance that led to marriage.         After running for mayor of Los Angeles in 1945 and again in 1949, Mrs. Weiss and her husband came to New York, where he served as editor and she as a staff writer for the party's newspaper, The Militant.         A fiery speaker, Mrs. Weiss was chosen in 1952 as the running mate of the party's Presidential candidate, Farrell Dobbs, a onetime truck driver who had virtually created the teamsters' union as a national force before becoming a Socialist Workers official. But in three Presidential campaigns, party records show, the Dobbs-Weiss ticket polled a total of only 10,381 votes in 7 states in 1952, 7,799 votes in 4 states in 1956 and 40,328 votes in 12 states in 1960.         Partly because they believed that the party's democratic ideals were being overriden by oppressive bureaucratic controls, the Weisses withdrew in the 1960's, but Mrs. Weiss never abandoned her radical vision -- and paid a price for it.         In 1972, after receiving a degree in political science from New York University, she found she could not get a teaching job, and worked as a proofreader as a member of the International Typographical Union. In her later years, she championed feminism along with socialism.         Mrs. Weiss, whose husband died in 1981, is survived by two sisters, Shirley Nagel of La Quinta, Calif., and Martha Stinehart of Los Angeles, and two brothers, Norman Tanner of Salt Lake City and Dee Tanner of Pasadena, Calif.       
         Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the poorest of the world's poor, died yesterday in Calcutta, India, where she had lived since her work with the destitute began five decades ago. She was 87.         Mother Teresa was hospitalized several times last year with heart, lung, kidney and other problems, and also suffered ill health in earlier years. Her physician in Rome, Vincenzo Bilotta, said she suffered cardiac arrest during the evening at her convent in Calcutta, The Associated Press reported.         As her health deteriorated over the past year, Mother Teresa stepped aside and her order, the Missionaries of Charity, chose a new leader, Sister Nirmala, in March.         Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in what is now Macedonia, was revered in India, where she worked for 68 years and became a citizen.         She also came to be honored around the world for the compassionate, effective way she set up and oversaw projects to provide care and comfort to the very poor and the very sick, orphans, lepers and the dying.         Traveling widely even in her later years, she became known to millions as a slight, brown-eyed figure -- she was only 5 feet tall -- smiling and dressed in the plain white sari with blue trim of her order.         Her work was considered by some a rebuke to widespread feelings of personal powerlessness in middle-class and wealthy societies. In 1968, Pope Paul VI praised her as an ''intrepid messenger of the love of Christ.''         The Nobel Committee said its award to her in 1979 was ''for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress in the world, which also constitute a threat to peace.'' Informed of the honor, she said simply, ''I am unworthy.''         But she came in for criticism, too. A British television documentary in 1994 contended that perceptions of her were colored by ''hyperbole and credulity.''         Mother Teresa, who had been a school administrator in a suburb of Calcutta, began working in the slums of that poverty-ridden and densely populated city in 1948. She had received what she described as a divine ''call within a call'' two years earlier while riding on a train. ''The message was quite clear,'' she recalled. ''I was to help the poor while living among them. It was an order.''         In 1950 she established the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, becoming its Superior General. She went on to organize far-flung programs for the impoverished, eventually reaching more than 90 countries.         Her chief task, as she defined it, was to provide ''free service to the poor and the unwanted, irrespective of caste, creed, nationality or race.''         In predominantly Hindu India, she made sure that the priests of her order gave last rites, the Roman Catholic sacrament for the dying, only on request, and that they dealt with the dead according to the practices of the individual's own religion. For the living, Mother Teresa set up orphanages, schools in slums and Pure Heart Homes for sick and dying homeless people.         Over the years, her work expanded. She set up mobile health clinics, centers for the malnourished, rehabilitation hospices for lepers, homes for alcoholics and drug addicts, and shelters for the homeless. Her centers in the United States included the Gift of Love Hospice for 15 men with AIDS, at 657 Washington Street, in Greenwich Village.         The number of sisters in her religious order, only 62 in 1957, grew enormously. By the time Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize, her order had attracted 1,800 nuns and 120,000 lay workers, running more than 80 centers in India and more than 100 others in other parts of the world. The order's patients included 53,000 lepers.         By 1988, her order was operating 600 mobile health clinics where almost four million people received treatment. That year Mother Teresa visited South Africa, which was still under apartheid rule, to set up a hostel in a black township. By early 1992, experts on Catholic welfare work reported, members of her order -- 4,000 nuns and novices, 400 priests and brothers and hundreds of thousands of lay volunteers -- worked at 450 sites worldwide, including in Albania and Iraq.         Aid and Tribute, But No Pity         Mother Teresa often paid tribute to the stricken people she cared for. Speaking to a gathering at the United Nations in 1975, she recalled a woman she had found dying on a Calcutta street.         ''I knew she was dying,'' she said softly. ''After I did what I could, she took my hand, gave me a beautiful smile and thanked me. She gave me more than I gave her.''         Mother Teresa put particular emphasis on giving the deprived and the sick a sensation of dignity through personal contact. ''Ours is a humble service,'' she said in an interview in 1975. ''We try to remain right down on the ground.''         But she said pity did not help the poor. They ''don't need pity, they need love and compassion,'' she once said, adding, ''If you don't know them, you don't love them and don't serve them.''         She said some people used to advise her that her order should have fans in some rooms used by its nuns. ''I do not want them to have fans,'' she continued. ''The poor whom they are to serve have no fans. Most of the girls come from village homes where they had no fans. They should not be more comfortable here than at home.''         In addition to piety, humility and warmth, she displayed strength of will, blunt practicality and organizational talent. The Nobel Committee said it meant to honor her as much for her managerial skills as for her devotion to the poor.         Mother Teresa earned her Nobel Prize despite a political climate in India that was unfavorable to foreign missionaries. In the 1970's the Government took measures to discourage such work, and by the time she won the prize the number of missionaries in India had shrunk to only a few hundred. It had formerly been 6,000. In 1979 there were about 15 million Christians in the country, 2.4 percent of the population of 630 million.         On certain social questions, Mother Teresa adhered outspokenly to the doctrine of her church. She voiced strong opposition to contraception, abortion and divorce.         In accepting the Nobel Prize, she declared: ''To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations. The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.''         Strong Adherence To Church Doctrine         In 1995, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, she helped dedicate a shelter in Washington for women and newborn infants. The center was meant to discourage abortions by providing quarters for children waiting to be adopted or put in foster homes.         And in February 1996, Senator Bob Dole, campaigning in Iowa for the Republican Presidential nomination, declared that Mother Teresa had called to praise him for helping pass a ban against certain types of late-term abortions.         In 1995, before a referendum in Ireland was narrowly passed to end a constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, opponents of the law were exasperated when a hand-written letter from Mother Teresa urging a ''no'' vote was made public.         On another occasion, she contended in effect that women's place was in the home, ''allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.''         Criticism of her came from various quarters. In an interview in 1995 in Calcutta, Debasis Bhattachariya of the Indian Science and Rationalists Association declared, ''Mother Teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen, because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society.''         Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation, voiced particularly strong criticism of her in a 1995 book, ''The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice'' (Verso). Mr.  Hitchens contended that she had ''furnished P.R.-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen.'' Her success, he said, ''depends on the exploitation of the simple and the humble by the cunning and the single-minded.''         The Philadelphia Inquirer's review of the book carried the headline, ''A Salvo of Cheap Shots Fired at a Contemporary Saint.''         The 1994 British television documentary that criticized Mother Teresa, titled ''Hell's Angel,'' was also written by Mr. Hitchens. Asked about the documentary, Mother Teresa said simply, ''Forgive them for they know not what they do.''         In the United States, her views were of such wide interest that ''The Simple Path,'' a book of her thoughts, experiences and beliefs compiled by Lucinda Vardey, was a best seller for 12 weeks in 1995 and 1996.         She was ''an incredible person,'' President Clinton said yesterday in Edgartown, Mass., where he was on vacation. The House of Representatives, observed a moment of silence.         Answering the Call To Become a Nun         Mother Teresa was born Agnes Bojaxhiu on either Aug. 26 or 27, 1910, to Albanian parents in Skopje, about 200 miles south of Belgrade. Studded with churches and mosques, the city is today the capital of Macedonia, but was then ruled by Ottoman Turks, before becoming part of Serbia in 1913.         Accounts have differed as to the profession of her father. An authorized biography of her that came out in Britain in 1992 said he was a building contractor. While a schoolgirl, she belonged to a Catholic lay women's group. At its meetings, letters were read from Balkan Jesuits who had gone as missionaries to Bengal, in eastern India.         At the age of 12 she first felt the desire to become a nun. At 18 she decided to do so and got in touch with the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish Catholic order with missions in Bengal. She joined the order in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin, in 1928. After English lessons there, she spent a more than a year in Darjeeling, north of Calcutta, where the order ran a girls' school.         She then became a teacher, mainly of geography and also of history and catechism, at St. Mary's High School, on the grounds of the Entally Convent outside Calcutta. Many of her pupils came from poor families. In time she learned Bengali and Hindi and became the school's principal.         It was while riding on a train on Sept. 10, 1946, that she received her ''call within a call,'' she said. She left her school and learned nursing skills from other nuns. Then she began her good works among Calcutta's poor, feeling uncertainties at first but also happiness as she set about meeting peoples' needs. ''I knew where I belonged,'' she recalled, ''but I did not know how to get there.''         Before long -- in 1950 -- she won canonical recognition for her new order, the Missionaries of Charity. The religious sisters who joined took vows of chastity, obedience, poverty and service.         One day in 1952, as her longtime associate Sister Agnes recalled years later, ''she found an old woman dying in the streets.''         ''We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital,'' Sister Agnes said, ''but before we could, she died. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.''         And so Mother Teresa set about establishing a home for the dying destitute. She persuaded Calcutta's municipal authorities to give her a shabby one-story building, which happened to stand next to a complex of Hindu shrines.         In that humble structure, she succeeded in creating a place where those who died would do so with dignity. The space was cleaned. The dying were cared for with compassion. The establishment was called Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart.         Mother Teresa's undertakings continued, one after another. There was a home for abandoned children, a leper colony and an old people's home. She went on to set up welfare institutions ranging from a family clinic, to mobile leprosy clinics, to nurseries for abandoned children.         A Strong Disdain For Mere Money         Her work brought in donations from admirers. She liked to say that money was ''really no problem, we depend on divine providence,'' and she said simply that her works were underwritten by ''cash and kind.''         She recalled that when her order opened a house in New York, ''Terence Cardinal Cooke was very anxious that he should give every month a maintenance for the sisters.''         ''I didn't want to hurt him,'' she said, ''but I didn't know how to explain to him that our services are purely for the love of God and that we cannot accept maintenance. I expressed it the only way I could: 'Your Eminence, I don't think God is going to become bankrupt in New York City!' ''         One longtime source of support was Catholic Relief Services, the overseas aid agency of the United States bishops, which operates in scores of countries. Its backing came largely in donations of United States Government surplus food.         In 1971 Mother Teresa's order opened its first house in the United States, in Harlem. It was soon moved to the Bronx, where, on a visit to the United States in 1980, Mother Teresa helped open a soup kitchen and declared her thanks to the poor people of New York ''for allowing themselves to be taken care of'' by her order. In 1981, she opened a mission in Newark.         Then in 1982, when she was 72, she worked for a number of days in Beirut, Lebanon, crisscrossing the Green Line that divided Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. She rescued dozens of mentally ill children from the dangers of warfare in the Muslim part of the city.         One of her biographers, Eileen Egan, reported in a 1985 book, ''Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa -- the Spirit and the Work,'' that a Red Cross official who helped her observed later: ''What stunned everyone was her energy. We didn't expect a saint to be so efficient.''         After suffering heart problems, Mother Teresa sent her resignation as head of her order to Pope John Paul II early in 1990. She said the time had come for ''younger hands.'' A new head was to be chosen that September. But when the time came she told reporters in Calcutta that God's will had kept her from stepping down. Catholic clergymen said she had been prevented from doing so when members of the order's electoral college, gathered from many countries, had been unable to agree on her successor. They re-elected her to her post.         Over the years, she received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees from universities ranging from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome to Harvard. She was awarded the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award. And she was an honorary citizen of Assisi, the hill town in central Italy where Francis of Assisi was born in 1182.         In addition to all her good works, Mother Teresa found time to compose prayers, including this one:         Make us worthy, Lord,         To serve our fellow men         Throughout the world who live and die         In poverty or hunger.         Give them, through our hands         This day their daily bread,         And by our understanding love,         Give peace and joy.         But she could also be briskly prosaic. In an interview in 1994 she said: ''I work all day. That is the best way.''       
         Connie Clausen, an actress and literary agent who began her career by riding circus elephants, died on Sept. 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Stedman Mays, an associate of Ms. Clausen's literary agency.         Ms. Clausen's career began in the 1940's when she rode atop elephants for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, providing the material for her memoir, ''I Love You Honey, but the Season's Over.'' After leaving the circus, she went to work at M-G-M studios in Hollywood, rising from messenger to director of special promotions.         In New York, she landed several roles on Broadway and television before becoming a publicity agent for Macmillan publishing in the 1970's. She helped publicize two of the company's international best-sellers, ''Watership Down'' and ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' and in 1973 was made an assistant vice president.         She left Macmillan in 1976 to start her own agency, Connie Clausen & Associates, which was a pioneer in the so-called beauty book, beginning with a series of best sellers by the photographer Francesco Scavullo. Other successful categories for Ms. Clausen were memoirs and biographies, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, and Quentin Crisp's ''Resident Alien: The New York Diaries.''         Ms. Clausen's three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Michael Andersen of San Francisco; a brother, Harold, of Orlando, Fla., and a sister, Dolores Clausen Brockmeyer of Sarasota, Fla.       
         Lotte Goslar, a dancer and mime known for her eccentric and whimsical comedy, died on Thursday at the Willowood Nursing Home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 90 and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         A short, roly-poly woman with a round, expressive face, Miss Goslar as a performer brought bugs, flowers and mushrooms vividly to life. She could portray a doting nanny and an obstreperous child with equal conviction.         In one of her most famous solos, ''Grandma Always Danced,'' she was seen, first, as a baby, then as a bride, a mother and an old woman. At any age, this character revealed her indomitability through her dancing and the sketch ended with her kicking up her heels as an angel in heaven.         As warm-hearted in person as she could be onstage, Miss Goslar was a popular teacher of mime and body movement for actors. She gave master classes at colleges and regional dance festivals across the country.  In the late 1940's, she taught in Los Angeles, where one of her pupils was Marilyn Monroe. They remained friends until the actress's death.         For all her gentle humor, Miss Goslar could castigate cruelty and indifference. The German playwright Bertolt Brecht devised the scenario for her ''Circus Scene,'' a depiction of a power struggle between a clown and a lion that can be interpreted as an allegorical attack upon authoritarianism. And Miss Goslar made her New York debut in 1937 in ''The Peppermill,'' an anti-fascist revue devised by Erika Mann, daughter of the novelist Thomas Mann.         Miss Goslar, who was born in Dresden, had first-hand knowledge of the choreographic and theatrical trends that made Germany artistically exciting during the 1920's. Influenced by many of them, she imitated none. Although she studied with Mary Wigman and Gret Palucca, the two most famous German modern dancers of the time, her primary interest became mime and she was inspired by Valeska Gert, a noted Berlin mime. But unlike Gert, who created scathing portraits of the dregs of society, Miss Goslar developed a gentle and more compassionate style.         Miss Goslar, who was not Jewish, despised Hitler and left Germany when the Nazis seized power. She remained in the United States after appearing with ''The Peppermill.'' For 10 years, beginning in 1943, she appeared in revues at the Turnabout Theater in Hollywood, sharing programs with Elsa Lanchester. She came to know Brecht, at that time living in California, and served as choreographer for the premiere in 1947 of his ''Galileo,'' which starred Charles Laughton.         Miss Goslar, who eventually settled on the East Coast, organized a company called Lotte Goslar's Pantomime Circus in 1954. It toured for decades, offering solo and group works for adults and children.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Katherine B. Oettinger, an authority on the care and upbringing of children, who was head of the Federal agency for the care of handicapped and underprivileged children, died on Monday in Carmel, Calif. She was 94.         Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957 as chief of the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Dr. Oettinger served four administrations. When the bureau was abolished in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her deputy assistant secretary for family planning and population. She retired from Government service in 1970 when the post was abolished in the Nixon Administration.         As an expert on retarded children, Dr. Oettinger expounded the view that such children could often be cared for in the home, and should be, though in an earlier time they were routinely sent to institutions. She was also intent on educating the nation about the difficult period of adjustment facing most parents of retarded children.         ''Some parents still blame themselves when they discover their child is retarded,'' she said, and then go from doctor to doctor looking for a ''cure,'' rather than counseling that will help them teach their children to learn to function with some degree of success.         Young parents, she said, particularly need help in evaluating whether the child can best be cared for at home, as 95 percent were by the 1960's, or in an institution. If the decision is the home, she said, careful parental training is needed in precise ways of giving consistent directions, for example, in using patterns of speech that the child can easily understand.         Dr. Oettinger received many awards and was called one of the nation's ''true heroines'' by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. After she left the Government, she traveled the world as a consultant on population control and family planning and wrote articles for social science journals and a well-received book, with Elizabeth C. Mooney, ''Not My Daughter: Facing Up to Adolescent Pregnancy'' (Prentice-Hall, 1979).         A native of Nyack, N.Y., she graduated from Smith College in 1925 with a degree in sociology and earned a master's degree in social work there.         Starting her career as a social worker in St. Paul, she moved to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, and then on to train nurses in the care of the handicapped in Scranton, Pa.         Her husband, Malcolm H. Oettinger, whom she married in 1930, died in 1963. She is survived by two sons, Malcolm Jr., of Chapel Hill, N.C., and John. B, of Los Angeles.         After her work in Scranton, she became director of community services in the Pennsylvania welfare department, working to improve mental health clinics and the training of welfare workers and ministers. She became the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University in 1954.         ''You'll never get rich as a social worker,'' she told her students. ''But the satisfaction comes from helping humanity -- it's a wonderful field.''       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Dr. Mina S. Rees, a mathematician who broke new ground for women as a university administrator and a leader in the sciences, died on Saturday at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Upper East Side.         At home in abstract and applied mathematics, Dr. Rees was founding president of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York. She was the first woman elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest alliance of scientists in the world.         Dr. Rees was born in Cleveland. She went to school in New York, attended Hunter College High School and graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College in 1923. She completed graduate studies at Columbia University, where she also studied law. She received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1931.         In the meantime, in 1926, she returned to Hunter as a mathematics instructor. Dr. Rees was an associate professor during World War II, when she went to work for the Government, helping to direct research in  modern mathematics for the war effort.         Dr. Rees was trained in pure algebra, but she was gifted with common sense and a knack for the practical, which stood her in good stead in dealing with the military.         ''I could sass the admirals as the men couldn't,'' she recalled later.         She was sent to the applied mathematics panel of the National Defense Research Committee in the Office of Research and Development.         By 1946, she was head of the mathematics branch of the Office of Naval Research, a position that she held until 1949, after which she was deputy director of the entire science division until 1953.         She worked on projects like fluid flow to solve antisubmarine problems, hydrofoil designs and early rocketry. She was awarded the President's Certificate of Merit and the British Medal for Service in the Defense of Freedom.         Dr. Rees also had an important role in the growth and diversification of mathematical studies. Many of her ideas left their mark on fast computer technology.         Dr. Rees returned to Hunter in 1953, as a professor and dean of students. She was responsible for academic affairs, including curriculum development, admissions standards, faculty recruitment and budgeting for teaching and research.         She became the first dean of graduate studies at CUNY in 1961, when the university drew up its doctoral programs. She was named president of the graduate division in 1969 and president of the newly consolidated Graduate School and University Center on 42d Street in 1971, before retiring the next year.         Dr. Rees was a Presidential appointee to the board of the National Science Foundation from 1964 to 1970, and she was active in the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, among other groups.         Dr. Rees enjoyed a crowning moment in 1969, when the 120,000-member American Association for the Advancement of Science elected her president. Women remained something of a rarity at that level in the scientific community, but she -- as  Marie Curie, Lisa Meitner and Dr. Margaret Mead before her -- had proved that scientific creativity was not just for men.         Dr. Rees's husband, Dr. Leopold Brahdy, died in 1977.       
         Dr. Hadassah Rosensaft, who is credited with having saved hundreds of Jewish inmates while a prisoner at Auschwitz, died on Friday in Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. She was 85 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Her son, Menachem, said Monday that the cause was liver failure  resulting from malaria and hepatitis she had contracted at Auschwitz.         Dr. Rosensaft was named by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 to the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. After she completed her second term in 1994, President Clinton appointed her son to the council. He is the founder of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and was its first chairman.         In 1945, Dr. Rosensaft was an important witness for the prosecution at a war crimes trial before a British military court in Luneburg, Germany, of former commandants and staff members of the Nazis' Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where she had spent a total of 20 months. Her tattooed concentration camp number visible on her left forearm, she stood and identified 15 of the 45 defendants, who were charged with mass murder.         Hadassah Bimko Rosensaft studied medicine at the University of Nancy in France, received her doctorate as a dental surgeon there in 1935 and practiced dentistry in her native city of Sosnowiec in southern Poland from then until August 1943, when she was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp along with her parents; her first husband, Josef Preserowicz, and their 5 1/2-year-old son, Benjamin.         All but she soon died in the gas chambers there, but, as her son recalled, ''because of her medical training, she was assigned to work in what was called the Jewish infirmary at Auschwitz, and in that capacity she saved hundreds of Jewish women'' from the gas chambers.         He recalled that since sick inmates were sent to the gas chambers, she would do things like tell camp officials that the ill inmates were actually healthy, or get the sick women dressed and send them out of the infirmary.         In testimony at a United States Senate subcommittee hearing in 1985, she described the death of one inmate under the foot of the notorious war criminal Dr. Josef Mengele. She said that late in 1943, while she was working in the Auschwitz infirmary, a young woman was late for roll-call outside her barracks. Dr. Rosensaft said Dr. Mengele ''ordered her to come forward'' and ''knocked her down with his booted foot,'' then put his foot on her chest. He hummed an ''aria from 'Madame Butterfly' and kept his foot there until the woman was dead'' from suffocation, Dr. Rosensaft testified. ''He showed the SS men a new way of killing.''         In November 1944, she was sent from Auschwitz in Poland to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, to work in the infirmary. She cared for 150 Jewish orphans there, her son recalled, before the camp was liberated in April 1945 by the British. He said that before liberation, she managed to get extra food and additional care for the orphans, and that only one of them, an infant, failed to survive.         Bergen-Belsen had been rife with infectious diseases, he said, and once she was freed, she told British officers about the conditions and became the civilian head of a hospital that took care of many former Bergen-Belsen inmates, almost all of them Jews.         She was using her maiden surname, Bimko, when she testified in 1945 before the British military court in Luneburg. She sometimes wept as she recounted Nazi crimes. She said some of the total of 45 defendants had picked out Jewish prisoners in the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen camps to be put to death or used as prostitutes.         The British prosecutor, Col. T. M. Backhouse, asked her whether she saw anyone in the courtroom who had taken part in the crimes she was recalling. ''Yes,'' she said.         The presiding judge, Maj. Gen. H. P. M. Berney-Ficklin, asked her to go to the center of the courtroom to get a better view of the accused, who were restless under the glare of floodlights. The defendants she recognized included Josef Kramer, former commandant at Bergen-Belsen, who had become known as ''the Beast of Belsen,'' and a Nazi guard at Auschwitz whom she recalled as ''accompanied always by a great dog.''         When she was asked, ''How many times were you beaten at Auschwitz?'' she answered: ''I, myself, only three times. I was beaten with the hand, and the blows were directed against my face. Twice I was beaten by Dr. Mengele and once by a supervisor named Kuch.''         In 1946, she married Josef Rosensaft, who was chairman of the Jewish Committee of Bergen-Belsen, which oversaw the day-to-day administration of the displaced-persons camp for Bergen-Belsen survivors from 1945 to 1950. Concurrently, he was the chairman of the Central Committee of Jews in the British Zone of Germany. He went on to be president of the World Federation of Bergen-Belsen Survivors Associations. He died in 1975.         Dr. Rosensaft also held high posts in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp and the Central Jewish Committee in the British Zone. At her death, she had been the honorary president of the World Federation of Bergen-Belsen Survivors Associations for two decades.         Beginning in the 1970's, she spent a decade cataloguing an extensive collection of documents and other materials she and her husband gathered about the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen camp, which she has donated to a museum in Jerusalem.         Besides her son, Menachem, of Manhattan, Dr. Rosensaft is survived by a granddaughter, Jodi.         At the end of a celebration of Dr. Rosensaft's 80th birthday, she said, speaking of her granddaughter, who was then 14, ''I pray Jodi will never be confronted by the bigotry that led to the Holocaust.''       
         Miriam Phillips, an actress on Broadway and in regional theaters for more than four decades, died on Oct. 24 at the Actors' Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 98.         Ms. Phillips, a native of Philadelphia, began her career at the Hedgerow Theater in Rose Valley, Pa., in 1924. There she performed more than 120 roles in classic and modern plays, appearing as Lady Macbeth, as Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and as Shaw's Candida.         She left the Hedgerow in 1956 and went on to act at the Alley Theater in Houston, Arena Stage in Washington and on Broadway, where she appeared in ''Waltz of the Toreadors'' and ''Filumena.'' Her television credits included the ''U.S. Steel Hour'' and ''As the World Turns.'' She also appeared in films, including ''Naked City,'' ''The Way We Live Now'' and ''Crossing Delancey.'' Her last role was in the Off Broadway play ''Daughters'' in 1986.         She is survived by her companion, Paul Modes.       
         Lillian Rogers Parks, who surprised President William Howard Taft in his bedroom in 1909 and lived to tell that and many another juicy White House tale, died on Thursday at a hospital in Washington. She was 100 and the writer of ''My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House.''         The title of Mrs. Parks's 1961 memoirs, written with Frances Spatz Leighton, was somewhat misleading. For although Mrs. Parks worked as an observant White House seamstress and maid only from the beginning of the Hoover Administration in 1929 to the end of the Eisenhower years in 1961, she had been a familiar figure at the White House since she was a little girl.         That is because her mother, Maggie Rogers, who joined the White House staff on the fourth day of the Taft Administration, would often take her daughter to work with her. And when she did not, she would come home to regale her family with stories of what she had seen or heard at the White House that day.         Mrs. Rogers, a one-time society hairdresser who had used her client connections to get the White House job, eventually became the No. 1 White House maid and stayed on into the 1930's, dusting, cleaning -- and taking notes.         It was her insistence that her daughter complete the book she had long planned that helped induce Mrs. Parks to combine her mother's recollections with her own in what became ''Backstairs,'' and two other books written with Miss Leighton: ''It was Fun Working in the White House,'' a children's book, and ''The Roosevelts: A Family in Turmoil,'' published in 1973.         Mrs. Parks had also seen ''White House Chef,'' a book Miss Leighton had written with a former chef in the Eisenhower White House. Realizing she had far more White House anecdotes to tell, Mrs. Parks got in touch with Miss Leighton.         ''Backstairs,'' which became the basis of a nine-part NBC miniseries in 1979, created an immediate sensation when it was published in 1961. The book, which was on The New York Times best-seller list for 26 weeks, so alarmed the incoming First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, that she ordered all White House domestic employees to sign a pledge not to write about their White House experiences. (The task of collecting the signatures was given to Mrs. Kennedy's secretary, Mary Gallagher, who neglected to sign one, herself, and eventually wrote her own tell-all with Miss Leighton, ''My Boss,'' in 1969.)         For all the furor it created in the White House, the Parks book was comparatively tame, providing a wealth of charming and intimate gossip about the various First Families she served but no serious scandal.         By her own account, Mrs. Parks, who contracted polio when she was 6 and used a crutch the rest of her life, had a generally privileged existence in the White House, so much so that when members of the domestic staff were barred from using the White House elevator in World War II, so the crippled President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could be evacuated quickly in an emergency, the President, himself, ordered an exception for ''Little Lillian,'' the universal nickname for a woman who never grew above 4 foot 9.         Mrs. Parks, who was divorced, leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she generally found something nice to say about every President and First Lady she or her mother worked for, Mrs. Parks, who clearly considered Bess Truman her favorite First Lady, also greatly admired Eleanor Roosevelt.         Indeed, her own White House career might have ended with the Hoover Administration had it not been for a ringing declaration of domestic independence by Mrs. Roosevelt. As recounted in ''Backstairs,'' Mrs. Roosevelt, who had long chafed at living under the thumb of her imperious mother-in-law at Hyde Park, was not cowed when the senior Mrs. Roosevelt arrived at the White House in 1933 to help get her son settled and to take charge of the household.         But when the elder Mrs. Roosevelt criticized her daughter-in-law ''for using colored help instead of white help, as was the custom at Hyde Park,'' the First Lady put her foot down.         ''Mother,'' she said, according to the maid who overheard the conversation, ''I have not told you this before, but I must tell you now. You run your house and I'll run mine.''         Although it has been almost 40 years since Mrs. Parks retired, there is reason to suspect that she may still be haunting the White House, a residence replete with ghosts.         As she described it in her book, on one of her first visits to the White House in 1909, her mother turned down the President's bed, then left her daughter in the bedroom, ordering her to stay put while she took care of some brief duties elsewhere.         While she waited, a ''very stout,'' ''jolly,'' man came into the room, took one look at the girl wearing a prim white dress and said: ''Well, what have we here? Are you the little ghost of the White House I've been hearing about?''       
         The French singer and songwriter known simply as Barbara, who earned a huge following in the French-speaking world for her melancholic lyrics and melodies, died on Monday in the American Hospital in Paris. She was 67.         Doctors gave the cause as acute pulmonary infection.         A slim woman with short hair and strikingly dark eyes who always appeared on stage dressed in black, Barbara belonged to the tradition of French-language singers like Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens and Leo Ferre for whom music was to a large measure a vehicle for poetry, sometimes humorous, more often nostalgic or even tragic.         Barbara, whose real name was Monique Serf, began her career in the 1950's performing songs by Brel and Brassens, but she made her name in the 1960's with her own songs, songs that remain popular to this day, among them ''L'Aigle Noir'' (''Black Eagle''), ''Ma plus belle histoire d'amour, c'est vous'' (''You are my most beautiful love story''), ''Il Pleut sur Nantes'' (''It's Raining in Nantes'') and ''Gottingen.''         Her death prompted an outpouring of tributes in France. ''She was talent, intensity, stage presence, passion, the passion of her words and rhythms, but also pure passion,'' President Jacques Chirac said today. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said she was ''a woman who knew suffering and understood the suffering of others,'' an apparent reference to her work for victims of AIDS. The former Culture Minister, Jack Lang, spoke of her ''unusual, mysterious and generous'' personality.         Barbara was born on June 9, 1930, in Paris. She studied the piano and voice as a teen-ager, but she dropped out of the Paris Music Conservatory to make her own career as a singer when she was only 19. Working in small theaters in Paris and Brussels, she made her first record in 1957. But it was in the early 1960's, with her own songs, that she joined Edith Piaf and Juliette Greco as a Left Bank favorite.         Her career peaked in the late 1960's and 70's, but she continued to draw large crowds to her concert series at Paris theaters, among them the Chatelet in 1987 and 1993 and the Mogador in 1990. In 1986, she directed a musical, ''Lily Passion,'' starring Gerard Depardieu. From 1987, she also became involved in the battle against AIDS, distributing condoms at her concerts and visiting the ailing in hospital.         Between 1980 and 1996, she produced no new records. She also announced her retirement from the stage in March 1994. But last year, she completed a final record, called simply ''Barbara,'' which was well received by French music critics. In her final years, her voice had lost much of its early purity, but it retained its dark passion, more than enough for her legions of fans here.         Barbara never married and left no survivors.       
         Helen Stevenson Meyner, a liberal Democrat who was elected to two terms in Congress by a heavily Republican district in New Jersey, died yesterday after a long illness at the Heartland Health Care Center, a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 69.         Mrs. Meyner was born into a prominent Democratic family in New York City in 1928. Her parents, William E. and Eleanor B. Stevenson, set up American Red Cross units in England and North Africa during World War II. Her father, who founded the law firm that became Debevoise & Plimpton, was president of Oberlin College in Ohio after the war and Ambassador to the Philippines from 1961 to 1964.         A graduate of Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Mrs. Meyner was a field worker for the Red Cross in Korea from 1950 to 1952, then a tour guide at the United Nations. There, she met an executive of Trans World Airlines, who hired her to travel the world promoting T.W.A. under the name Mary Gordon.         In 1956, she volunteered for the Presidential campaign of Adlai E. Stevenson, a distant cousin of her mother's, and met Gov. Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey, who was visiting Oberlin College. They were married the following year.         At Morven, the governor's mansion in Princeton, Mrs. Meyner welcomed visitors like Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. She also served on the boards of the Newark Museum, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and Rider College. As a member of a panel of the Kennedy Administration, Mrs. Meyner studied the problems of the United States Foreign Service corps in Eastern Europe.         Because of a two-term limit, the Meyners left Morven in 1962 and bought a home in Princeton. Mr. Meyner began a law practice, and Mrs. Meyner continued her community service.         After four years of fertility treatment in the late 1960's, Mrs. Meyner became pregnant for the first time and gave an interview to The Ladies' Home Journal for an article titled ''My Miracle Baby.'' But in February 1970, the month the article was published, her baby, a full-term boy, was born dead. Mrs. Meyner is survived by a sister, Priscilla Hunt, of Cambridge, Mass.         In 1972, Democratic Party leaders asked her to run for Congress from the Meyner family home in Phillipsburg, in the heavily Republican 13th Congressional District in Sussex and Morris Counties. She lost that election to Joseph J. Maraziti, a Republican, but defeated him in 1974, the same year that Representative Millicent Fenwick, a Republican, was elected. Only two other women had represented New Jersey on Capitol Hill before.         Overshadowed somewhat by Representative Fenwick, Mrs. Meyner, who established a solidly liberal voting record, was sometimes referred to as New Jersey's ''other Congresswoman.''         During her two terms in office, Mrs. Meyner served on the Committee on International Relations, but turned down an invitation to join the powerful Ways and Means Committee, saying she feared stretching herself too thin. As a member of International Relations, she fought to stop the nuclear arms race, but she  helped prevent the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County from closing in 1976 by having the Armament Research and Development Command transferred there.         Mrs. Meyner also pressed for women's rights while in Congress. In 1978, she was defeated by the Republican candidate, Jim Courter.         After leaving Washington, Mrs. Meyner served on the boards of directors of Allied Chemical, Girard Trust and Prudential Insurance, and through her work in these companies, she continued to advocate for women. In 1990, Governor Meyner died and Mrs. Meyner retired to Captiva Island, Fla. She and her family established the Robert B. Meyner and Helen S. Meyner Center for the Study of State and Local Government at her husband's alma mater, Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.       
         Edna Flannery Kelly, the first woman to represent Brooklyn in Congress and an expert in foreign affairs and social policy, died on Sunday at the home of her daughter in Alexandria, Va. She was 91.         A lifelong New Yorker, she had moved to Alexandria in 1982 following a stroke. Mrs. Kelly, who had cancer, experienced another stroke shortly before her death, her daughter, Maura Patricia Kelly, said.         For many of her 19 years as a Democrat in the House of Representatives, from 1949 to 1968, Mrs. Kelly was the sole woman in the New York delegation. When she left office, a departure brought about by shifting demographics in the borough, she was the third-ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.         Mrs. Kelly joined Congress after winning a special election in 1949 to fill an unexpired term in the 10th Congressional District and she was re-elected nine times in landslide victories, later representing the 12th District. But after district lines were redrawn in 1968, she decided to challenge a strong incumbent, Emanuel Celler, in a different district and lost that race. Her reconfigured district sent Shirley Chisholm to Congress as Brooklyn's first black Representative.         Edna Flannery was born in East Hampton on Long Island. Following her graduation from Hunter College in 1928, she married Edward L. Kelly, a lawyer active in Democratic politics who was a justice in the city court system. Mrs. Kelly herself had no political agenda initially, but her husband was killed in a car accident in 1942 and she later said she became active to carry on in his tradition. Her first job was to breathe life into the moribund women's auxiliary of Brooklyn's Madison Democratic Club, a hub of party activity.         She later joined the county executive committee and took on the chore of research director for the Democrats in the State Legislature. In that position, she built the network that later assured her nomination for the vacant seat in 1949.         She quickly became an expert on the Soviet bloc, led fact-finding missions throughout the world and, as head of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, championed NATO and a strong Europe as a bulwark against international Communism. She also helped to write foreign-policy legislation that, among other things, created the Peace Corps.         Serving during the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, she sponsored measures to settle displaced people after World War II and refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. She helped create the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.         She advocated women's and social issues, drawing attention to inequities in pay, credit and tax policy, including what she considered inadequate deductions for child care. She helped increase the deductions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.         Mrs. Kelly was used to easy re-election in one of the city's most densely populated districts, encompassing all or part of Flatbush, Crown Heights, Kensington, Borough Park and Bedford-Stuyvesant. During her tenure, the district's ethnic composition changed markedly, leading state legislators to reapportion the borough to acknowledge Bedford-Stuyvesant's growing black constituency.         Unwilling to run against Ms. Chisholm, who soon became a leading candidate for that Congressional seat, Mrs. Kelly took on Representative Celler, the dean of the state's Congressional delegation. The race in the reconfigured 10th district pitted two party regulars against each other, and Mrs. Kelly, her power base gone, lost to Mr. Celler in the primary.         Besides her daughter, Mrs. Kelly is survived by a son, William E. 2d, of Spring Lake, N.J.; a sister, Katherine Duryea of Amityville, N.Y.; eight grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.       
         Sally Marr, the mother of the comedian Lenny Bruce and a primary influence on her son's career, died Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91 and lived in West Hollywood.         Although Ms. Marr was mainly known for encouraging her son as a performer, she was herself a professional comic and talent spotter. Among those she helped discover were Pat Morita, Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong and Sam Kinison.         She was born Sadie Kitchenberg in Jamaica, N.Y., and was married at 17. After her husband left her, she brought up their son, Leonard, on her own, supporting the two of them by working as a waitress and maid. Subsequently she made her night club debut as a stand-up comic, doing impersonations of movie stars like James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Her son started his career by imitating his mother's act, then, urged on by her, he began creating his own routines, drawing freely from his life with his mother.         After Bruce died in 1966, Ms. Marr continued to perform, appearing in night clubs, in movies and on television. In 1994, Joan Rivers was one of the authors and the star of ''Sally Marr . . . and Her Escorts,'' a Broadway play ''suggested by the life of Sally Marr.''         In a 1989 interview, Ms. Marr said: ''People are always saying that everything in comedy stems from Lenny -- that everything touches him. What can I tell you? He took after me!''         She is survived by a granddaughter, Kitty Bruce of Pittston, Pa.       
         Dawn Steel, the first woman to head a major movie studio and who played a prominent role advancing other women to top jobs in Hollywood, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here. She was 51 and lived in Los Angeles.         Charles Roven, Ms. Steel's husband, a film producer, said Ms. Steel had been suffering from a malignant brain tumor.         ''When I got the call 21 months ago from the doctor about Dawn's condition,'' said Mr. Roven, ''I was told that 97 percent of the people who had this die within the first six months. It goes to show what spirit she had.''         Ms. Steel, who came to Hollywood in the 1970's to take a merchandising job at Paramount, rose quickly to become president of production at that studio, where she oversaw development of such films as ''Flashdance,'' ''Footloose,'' ''Top Gun,'' ''The Untouchables,'' ''Fatal Attraction'' and ''The Accused.'' She became the first woman to head a major studio when she held the top job at Columbia Studios from October 1987 until January 1991. During her reign, the studio's films included ''Awakenings,'' ''Flatliners,'' ''Ghostbusters 2'' and ''Casualties of War.''         Ms. Steel produced several movies in recent years, among them ''Cool Runnings,'' a highly successful comedy about a Jamaican bobsled team. She and Mr. Roven have produced ''Fallen,'' starring Denzel Washington, and ''City of Angels,'' with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage, both to be released next year.         Ms. Steel's career and life were marked by a powerful, even outsize, personality that helped her succeed in a business dominated by men.  ''She was highly opinionated, extremely self-confident, had a fantastic sense of humor and was someone of enormous style and taste,'' said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the partners of Dreamworks SKG, and an early mentor of Ms. Steel's at Paramount, along with Michael Eisner and Barry Diller. He added, ''Maybe under the facade she was scared and intimidated by it all, but I didn't see a scintilla of that.''         Nora Ephron, the writer, who was given her first directorial job by Ms. Steel, said: ''Dawn certainly wasn't the first woman to become powerful in Hollywood, but she was the first woman to understand that part of her responsibility was to make sure that eventually there were lots of other powerful women. She hired women as executives, women as producers and directors, women as marketing people.         ''The situation we have today, with a huge number of women in powerful positions, is largely because of Dawn Steel,'' said Ms. Ephron.         Ms. Steel was one of President Clinton's earliest supporters in Hollywood. In the last year, Mr. Clinton had phoned her several times, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Ms. Steel at her home in the Coldwater Canyon area of Los Angeles.         Characteristically, Ms. Steel often laughed with friends when recalling her first meeting with Mr. Clinton.         ''You're not as bad as I thought you'd be,'' Mr. Clinton told her.         Ms. Steel's skill as an executive was sometimes overshadowed by a reputation for an abrasive, take-no-prisoners style. She was called Steel Dawn and the Tank. ''It hurt me deeply, this reputation as tough, hard, mean,'' she said in 1993, following the publication of her autobiography ''They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You: Lessons From the Front.'' She added: ''It was very painful, it came from guys who wanted to kill me. In some ways I was curt because there's an unbelievable amount to accomplish in a day.''         ''Look, I'm not Mary Poppins,'' she said at another point, ''but I think I functioned with integrity.''         The films that Ms. Steel most enjoyed seeing and making -- such as ''Flashdance,'' about a female welder who wants to dance, and ''Cool Runnings'' -- were personal to her. These are stories of outsiders with outlandish ambitions who overcome numerous obstacles to get what they want. ''She had a formula for many of her movies that carried a simple truth: You want something, you work incredibly hard, you get it,'' said Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and a close friends.         Although Ms. Steel often said that she was just ''an ordinary middle-class girl from New York,'' the story of her life was far from ordinary and, like those of many other wealthy and successful moguls in Hollywood, self-invented.         She was born in the Bronx on Aug. 19, 1946, and grew up in Manhattan and ''in a crummy neighborhood on the wrong side of the tracks'' in Great Neck, N.Y., according to her autobiography. Her father, Nat, was a zipper salesman to the military who had a nervous breakdown when she was a child; her mother, Lillian, was a formidable businesswoman compelled to work to support the family. (The family's name was originally Spielberg, but her father changed it to Steel to reflect his prowess as a semiprofessional weight lifter).         Ms. Steel ran out of money after a year at Boston University, and attended New York University's School of Commerce for two years, studying marketing. By 1968 Ms. Steel was working as a receptionist in the garment district and soon found a low-level marketing job at Penthouse magazine devising X-rated products. (She initially told her parents she was working at Mademoiselle.)         Answering phones at Penthouse, Ms. Steel noticed that amaryllis plants took on a phallic look just before blooming. As she recalled, she hired an artist to exaggerate the effect and wrote her own copy for the ad: ''Grow your own . . . All it takes is $6.98 and a lot of love.'' The plant was so popular that Penthouse could not keep it in stock.         Ms. Steel's tenacity, and flair for theatrics, was made evident in 1975 while she was traveling through Europe looking for gimmicky gift ideas. She came up with the notion of poking fun at the Gucci label by stamping it on toilet paper. She solicited orders from boutiques and formed her own company, Oh Dawn! Inc., she said, ''because when I said I was in the toilet-paper business, people would say, 'Oh Dawn!' ''         Soon enough, the Gucci family sued her for copyright infringement. Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and former administrative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay, agreed to take her case even though, he later recalled, she ''didn't have a dime, she was living by her wits.'' Mr. Davidoff, building a First Amendment defense, made sure the New York tabloids heard about the case, which was quickly headlined ''the toilet-paper caper'' and led to an editorial cartoon showing the Gucci family as Goliath and poor Dawn Steel as David. The case was settled out of court.         By 1978, Ms. Steel had ended a 10-month marriage, sold her business to her ex-husband and asked Mr. Davidoff to place a call to his friend Mr. Katzenberg about a marketing job for her at Paramount. She was hired and quickly impressed her bosses.         Asked in 1993 why men like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Katzenberg had rapidly advanced her career, Ms. Steel replied: ''One was that I was funny. I wasn't heavy furniture. I made them laugh and entertained them. And the other thing was that I could identify a good idea. Not a lot of people can do that. That was my gift.''         She was once compared to a tank by the producer Dan Melnick. ''She would just lower her head and charge through all the red tape and bureaucracy,'' he said. ''She's the most determined woman in the business.''         Her early advocacy of ''Flashdance'' (1983), an unlikely blue-collar musical that turned into a huge hit grossing $95 million in the United States, solidified her position at Paramount. ''Flashdance'' was followed by ''Footloose,'' another hit.         By 1985, Paramount's president, Ned Tanen, appointed Ms. Steel president of production, making her one of the highest-ranking female executives in Hollywood. She had already developed a celebrity persona that made photographers take as many pictures of her at a premiere as a movie actress. She prided herself on her crown of leonine hair -- Ms. Ephron once introduced ''Dawn Steel and her hair'' at an awards luncheon for women -- and her romantic relationships with such figures as the actor Richard Gere and Martin Scorsese, the director.         Ms. Steel's dismissal from Paramount remains one of the more unusual in recent Hollywood history. Having married Mr. Roven in 1985, she was in the hospital after the birth of her only child, Rebecca, in March 1987, when she learned that Frank Mancuso, chairman of Paramount, and Mr. Tanen, chairman of the Motion Picture Group, had ousted her. Exactly why they did was unclear.         As Ms. Steel told Playboy years later, her husband walked into the hospital room with a newspaper under his arm and said, ''I don't know how to tell you this, babe, but you got fired while you were in labor.'' Ms. Steel said. ''I remember thinking, 'I will not cry, I will not let them make me cry.' ''         In addition to her husband and daughter, she is survived by a brother, Larry, of Manhattan.         Within six months of her ouster at Paramount, Ms. Steel was offered the job of running Columbia Studios, which was owned by Coca-Cola. Lynda Obst, a producer who was given her early producing jobs by Ms. Steel, said that one of the personal high points of her tenure at Columbia was the decision to restore and reissue the David Lean classic ''Lawrence of Arabia.'' ''It was something that she was extraordinarily proud of,'' said Ms. Obst.         Ms. Steel left the job in 1991, following Sony's purchase of the studio. Her settlement was reportedly in excess of $6 million.         Ms. Steel, in reviewing her career a few years ago, recalled that her commitment to helping women in Hollywood was a slow one. ''I must tell you, I did feel threatened by other women in those early years,'' she said. ''I was so busy climbing up this ladder, staying above the water. If there was only room for one woman in a room, I wanted to be her. I'm not proud of it. I certainly don't feel that way now. It was an absolute evolution for me.''       
         Kathy Acker, a child of Sutton Place who rose to prominence as a willfully abrasive novelist and performance artist in the post-punk East Village of the 1970's and 80's, died on Sunday at an alternative cancer treatment center in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 53 and lived in San Francisco.         Ms. Acker, who left New York for London in 1984 before moving to California in recent years, had battled breast cancer for 18 months and had been at the Tijuana center for three weeks, friends said.         The author of 10 novels, dozens of stories and essays, an opera libretto and a screenplay, she began as a writer by publishing her own books and peddling them from bookshop to bookshop, once working as a stripper on 42d Street to support herself.         Scenes of disturbing violence and sexuality peppered her works, as did her penchant for characters who would change gender and identities without warning and her habit of taking scenes from classic novels and injecting them with erotic scenes and raw, raging language.         One of her books, ''Blood and Guts in High School'' (1984), was banned in Germany and South Africa.         Michiko Kakutani described Ms. Acker's style in a 1987 review in The New York Times: ''Characters exchange identities with the ease of snakes shedding their skins; and bits of myths, folk tales and older novels also turn up transformed -- juxtaposed, in a sort of post-modernist collage, with political screeds, dream-like hallucinations and strange, comic exchanges. The language is nervous and skewed; the authorial stance, adversarial and abrasive; the world view, cynical verging on the nihilistic.''         In her performance pieces, done at clubs in Britain and America, Ms. Acker often read from her novels. She also collaborated on numerous musical and theatrical projects.         Ms. Acker cut a well-known figure in the East Village scene of the early 80's, favoring leather clothes, spiky hair styles, red lipstick and stiletto heels. She told interviewers that she also considered her body a work of art, and was a devotee of piercing, tattooing and bodybuilding.         Her other novels include ''Great Expectations'' (1983), ''Don Quixote'' (1986), ''Literal Madness'' (1987), ''My Mother: Demonology'' (1993) and ''Pussy, King of the Pirates'' (1995).         Her opera libretto, ''Birth of a Poet,'' on which she collaborated with the composer Peter Gordon, was performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1985. A film based on her screenplay, ''Variety,'' was released the same year.         Ms. Acker once said she drew her greatest inspiration from the novelist William Burroughs. ''He was my model,'' she said. ''For me, he was the first writer, the only one who was working politically in the field of language as power. He was questioning language. Everybody else was just thinking about it.''         She is survived by a half-sister, Wendy Bowers of Belchertown, Mass.       
         Tamara Geva, a Russian-born dancer and actress who was the first wife of the choreographer George Balanchine, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         A sophisticated woman with a wide range of cultural interests, Miss Geva's career took her from ballet to musical comedy and serious drama. As a performer with Balieff's ''Chauve-Souris,'' a touring revue featuring Russian emigres, she introduced Balanchine's choreography to New York in 1927 by dancing two brief solos by him.         In 1936, Miss Geva and Ray Bolger created a Broadway sensation in the Rodgers and Hart musical ''On Your Toes,'' for which Balanchine choreographed both the dramatic ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'' sequence and a balletic parody. Reviewing the show in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Miss Geva ''is so magnificent as the mistress of the dance that she can burlesque it with the authority of an artist on a holiday.''         Later she acted in plays by authors as diverse as Euripides, Shaw and Sartre. Her vivid autobiography ''Split Seconds'' (1972) describes her tumultuous family history and life in St. Petersburg at the time of the Russian Revolution.         Born in St. Petersburg, Miss Geva, who shortened her surname when she came to the West, was the daughter of Levko Gevergeyev, a wealthy manufacturer of church vestments and a patron of avant-garde artists. As a child, she lived in an enormous 18th-century house that included a miniature theater and a theater museum. The latter still exists, now called the State Museum of Theater and Music.         Although her father was a freethinker, his parents had been raised as Muslims, and they disapproved of the woman he loved. Miss Geva's parents were not officially married until she was 6. As a child, she studied ballet with a private teacher. After the revolution, when the illustrious Maryinsky Ballet School permitted children of non-Christian backgrounds to enroll, Miss Geva entered as a night student. There she met Balanchine, who was teaching ballroom dance classes. They were married in 1923.         Miss Geva and Balanchine left the Soviet Union in 1924 with a troupe called the Soviet State Dancers. After a stint with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, she joined Balieff's revue, which brought her to New York. By that time, she and Balanchine had separated.         Miss Geva performed on Broadway in such musicals as ''Whoopee'' (1928), ''Three's a Crowd'' (1930) and ''Flying Colors'' (1932). In 1935, she appeared with the American Ballet, Balanchine's first New York company. After that she devoted herself to films and the theater.         She appeared in such movies as ''Their Big Moment'' (1934), ''Manhattan Merry-Go-Round'' (1937) and ''Orchestra Wives'' (1942), and she choreographed the dances in ''Specter of the Rose'' (1946), Ben Hecht's film about a ballerina who falls in love with an insane dancer.         On the stage, Miss Geva and Raymond Massey starred in the London premiere of Robert E. Sherwood's antiwar play, ''Idiot's Delight,'' in 1938. She acted in Euripides' ''Trojan Women'' in New York in 1941 and in a Los Angeles production of Sartre's ''No Exit'' in 1947. She portrayed a sarcastic Polish acrobat in a New York revival of Shaw's ''Misalliance'' in 1953; the cast also included Roddy McDowall and Richard Kiley. Miss Geva and Haila Stoddard created ''Come Play With Me,'' a musical comedy with a score by Dana Suesse that had a brief Off Broadway run in 1959.         No immediate family members survive.
