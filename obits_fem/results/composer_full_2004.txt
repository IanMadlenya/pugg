         Charlotte Zwerin, a documentary filmmaker known for insightful depictions of visual and performing artists like Christo, Willem de Kooning, Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Lisa Tesone said.         Ms. Zwerin worked for many years with David and Albert Maysles, early practitioners of the documentary genre known as cinéma vérité, which uses a small camera to capture the drama of daily experience. Her editing for them was of such quality that they gave her credit as the third director of well-known films like ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), an account of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour of the United States.         It was her decision to include the band members' reactions to the killing of a fan on the stage of a concert at the Altamont Speedway in Livermore, Calif., the site of the tour's last concert.         ''The real hero of the making of the film was Charlotte Zwerin, who edited it and got a directing credit,'' Stephen Lighthill, a cameraman, said in an interview with Salon.com. ''I was stunned with what she got out of my footage. She compressed it and gave you a sense of a buildup of tragedy that you otherwise wouldn't have.''         Other films she did with the Maysleses included ''Salesman'' (1969), an account of four real-life sales representatives of the American Bible Company, and ''Running Fence'' (1978), a chronicle of the successful efforts of the artist Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, to erect a 24-mile fabric fence in the California hills.         Her own films included ''Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser'' (1989), which contained rarely seen clips of the brilliant and eccentric jazz pianist; ''Arshile Gorky'' (1982), a profile of the abstract painter; ''Sculpture of Spaces: Noguchi'' (1995); ''American Masters -- Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live For'' (1999), a biography narrated by Tony Bennett; and ''Toru Takemitsu: Music for the Movies'' (1994), an examination of the Japanese composer. The Museum of Modern Art had a retrospective of her works last year.         Charlotte Mitchell was born on Aug. 15, 1931, in Detroit and developed her affection for film and music as a child by attending an entertainment event in Detroit called ''Big Band and a Movie.'' First came a live band, then the film, she said in an interview with The New York Times last year.         She attended Wayne State University, where she established a film society before moving to New York and finding work as a librarian at CBS for its documentary series ''The 20th Century.'' She slowly worked her way up to editor, then joined Drew Associates, where Robert Drew was pioneering ''direct cinema,'' as cinéma vérité was also called. She met the Maysleses at Drew.         She told The Times she stopped working with the Maysleses because they would not let her produce. ''They cast an awful long shadow, and it came time for me to get out of it,'' she said.         On her own films she became known for a personal signature characterized by innovative editing. Leonard Feather, a critic for The Los Angeles Times, said that her film on Monk provided ''a closer glance behind the veil of this half-hidden, exotically gifted figure than could ever be observed during his sadly aborted career.''         Ms. Zwerin was divorced from Michael Zwerin, a jazz critic. She is survived by her brother, Charles Mitchell, and sister, Margaret Tesone, both of Detroit.         Correction:  January 31, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the documentary film maker Charlotte Zwerin on Tuesday misstated the location of the fatal stabbing of a fan at a 1969 Rolling Stones concert shown in ''Gimme Shelter,'' a film she edited. It occurred in front of the stage, not onstage.       
         May O'Donnell, an early Martha Graham principal dancer and a modern-dance choreographer and teacher, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 97.         Her death was reported by Marian Horosko, who is writing a book about her.         The serene Ms. O'Donnell might have served as the model for the tranquil all-seeing Pioneer Woman in Graham's 1944 ''Appalachian Spring,'' a role she created. Yet she had a robust sense of humor about the world of dance, and she was the rare dancer who stood up to the strong-willed Graham with quiet determination.         Ms. O'Donnell choreographed a modern-dance classic, the 1943 ''Suspension,'' which was inspired by her memory of seeing a plane below the hilltop on which she was standing in wartime California. That work was best explained, she felt, by T. S. Eliot's observation in ''Four Quartets'' that dance was ''at the still point of the turning world.''         In the piece dancers moved slowly amid boxes and a large turning mobile, seeming at times to float. ''Suspension'' confounded audiences accustomed to the highly charged narrative dances then popular. ''O'Donnell created a poetical cloud of movement that refused to be hurried,'' Donald McDonagh wrote in his Complete Guide to Modern Dance. ''The work didn't thunder, shout or roar its message; it whispered but eventually achieved recognition.''         Ms. O'Donnell was born in Sacramento and would later recall the heady openness and freedom of California, which had also affected the young Graham. In California, Ms. O'Donnell trained with Estelle Reed and Michio Ito before studying in New York with Graham. She performed with Graham from 1932 to 1938, then returned to California and founded the San Francisco Dance Theater with her husband, the composer Ray Green, and a Graham colleague and lifelong friend, Gertrude Shurr.         Ms. O'Donnell toured with José Limón from 1940 to 1942. She returned to Graham's company in 1944, dancing as a guest artist for nine years. During that time she created the major roles of the Attendant in Graham's ''Herodiade'' (1944), She of the Earth in ''Dark Meadow'' (1946) and the Chorus in ''Cave of the Heart'' (1946). She also danced principal roles in ''Letter to the World,'' ''Deaths and Entrances,'' ''Every Soul Is a Circus'' and ''Primitive Mysteries.'' She retired from the stage in 1961.         Ms. O'Donnell choreographed from 1937 to 1988, presenting her first program of her own work in 1939. In 1949 she founded a New York-based company that performed into the 1980's. In 2002 she received the Martha Hill Lifetime Achievement Award.         Her repertory of 50 documented dances included many collaborations with Mr. Green, who died in 1997. Ms. O'Donnell is survived by a brother, Charles Melton O'Donnell of Sacramento.         Ms. O'Donnell was also an influential teacher. Her students included Gerald Arpino, Cora Cahan, Robert Joffrey, Ben Vereen and Dudley Williams. Mr. Vereen recalled Ms. O'Donnell's mystique in a 1983 interview in The New York Times.         ''May was very gentle, even then, and her classes had such an easy flow,'' he said. ''Complete journeys in themselves. I always wanted to get closer to her. But I was very shy.'' She taught only once a week, he said, adding: ''I'd think in between, 'Where does she go?' She'd bring in this wonderful, warm love and then disappear.''       
         Naomi Shemer, an Israeli poet and a prolific composer whose popular songs include ''Jerusalem of Gold,'' which became interwoven with the culture of the Jewish state, died on Saturday at a Tel Aviv hospital after a long illness. She was 74.         Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moshe Katsav were among the thousands of mourners at her funeral on Sunday at Kibbutz Kinneret, the place of her birth.         Mr. Sharon had begun the weekly cabinet meeting earlier that day by paying tribute to Ms. Shemer, calling her a woman who ''managed, with her beautiful melodies, to connect us to our roots,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         ''Jerusalem of Gold'' was written just before the 1967 Middle East war, in which Israel seized control of the city from Jordan. The ballad made her famous as it gained the status of an informal second national anthem once Israel had ''reunited'' the ancient city.         In the song, Ms. Shemer called on the emotions evoked by thoughts of the Old City and Judaism's holiest sites. Making the city whole realized a dream almost two millennia after the destruction of its last Jewish temple.         Ms. Shemer captured the spirit of that victorious moment when Israel asserted itself by adding another verse after the war to celebrate the event. The song is often heard at public ceremonies and on the radio in Israel.         Another popular Shemer song was based on the Beatles' ''Let It Be.'' Through it she sought to restore hope in Israelis after the costly war with Egypt and Syria in 1973.         She complemented her original work with Hebrew adaptations of foreign poetry. After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, she rendered Walt Whitman's ''O Captain! My Captain!'' into Hebrew, set it to music and dedicated it to the slain prime minister.         Ms. Shemer, whose parents helped found Kibbutz Kinneret, grew up with singalongs. She studied at the Rubin Academy of Music in Jerusalem, and served with an entertainment unit in the Israeli Army. Returning to the kibbutz, she taught rhythm in school and began to write children's songs. Her career broadened after she moved to Tel Aviv in the mid-1950's. Her songs often recalled the landscapes of her childhood, but she could just as easily relate to contemporary Israeli city scenes.         Teddy Kollek, who was elected mayor of Jerusalem in 1965, commissioned her to write a hymn to the city. It was first heard at the Israel Song Festival in Jerusalem. Then, after the war of 1967, she added a verse that included the lyrics, ''Back to the wells and to the fountains, within the ancient walls.''         In 1983 she was given the Israel Prize for her contributions to Israeli music. She also held several honorary doctorates, served as head of the Israeli entertainers' union, and was a member of the Hebrew Language Academy.         Ms. Shemer's first marriage, to Gideon Shemer, ended in divorce. According to the daily newspaper Haaretz, she is survived by her second husband, Mordechai Horowitz; their son, Daniel; a daughter, Lali, from her first marriage; four grandchildren; a brother; and a sister.       
         Sylvia Herscher, whose 50-year career in theater included stints as an agent, a general manager and a producer, died on Wednesday at her home in New York, her son David said. She was 91.         When Ms. Herscher received a special Tony Award in 2000, she modestly credited her long career to forces beyond the control of someone like her, a would-be actress born to Eastern European immigrants of no great means. ''A confluence of everything coming together and a lot of luck,'' she told Barry Singer for a profile in The New York Times. ''That's all.''         It was not luck but the quiet backstage efforts of Ms. Herscher that allowed everything to come together for some of Broadway's greatest musicals. As the longtime aide-de-camp of the composer and producer Jule Styne, she assisted in the fabled 1952 rebirth of ''Pal Joey,'' easing the tension between the composer, Richard Rodgers, and the book writer, John O'Hara. Decades later, she played matchmaker between the lyricist Ed Kleban and the director-choreographer Michael Bennett. The result: ''A Chorus Line.'' When Ms. Herscher became an agent, she was a favorite sounding board for Jerry Herman.         ''She had a remarkable ability to put together the pieces that make great theater,'' Mr. Herman said in a telephone interview. ''She was at one time my publisher and at another my agent, but above all a supportive friend. There was no one in my life that I depended upon more than Sylvia for her instincts and her wisdom about what works onstage.''         Born Sylvia Kossovsky in New York in 1913, Ms. Herscher effectively began her theatrical career when Alexander Cohen, a producing partner of her husband, Seymour Herscher, helped her obtain a job as Styne's secretary. She could not type but soon became his general manager.         Ms. Herscher oversaw the shows ''Hazel Flagg'' (1953), ''Mr. Wonderful'' (1956), ''A Visit to a Small Planet'' (1957), ''Say, Darling'' (1958) and ''First Impressions'' (1959). She was also associate producer of the 1955 comedy ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?''         In 1960 Ms. Herscher became an agent at William Morris, working on shows like Sidney Michaels's ''Tchin-Tchin'' (1962) and ''Dylan'' (1964); ''Any Wednesday'' (1964) by Muriel Resnik; and Athol Fugard's ''Blood Knot'' (1964).         In 1966, Ms. Herscher moved to the music publisher Edwin H. Morris. Music publishers remained a vital force in the Broadway economy at that time, providing financial support to both established and struggling composers. There she worked with Harold Arlen, Charles Strouse and Lee Adams and, most rewardingly, with Mr. Herman, who became a close friend. Among the scores published under her auspices were Mr. Herman's ''Mame'' (1966) and ''Mack and Mabel'' (1974), ''Applause'' (1970), ''Grease'' (1972), ''Shenandoah'' (1975) and ''A Chorus Line'' (1975).         ''A Chorus Line'' was in effect her swan song at the company. Ms. Herscher moved over to head the theater department for another publisher, G. Schirmer. But the Broadway musical was by then in decline, and Ms. Herscher retired in 1982.         Ms. Herscher's husband died in 1994. She is survived by two sons, David and Leonard; two daughters, Miriam and Elaine; and two grandchildren.
