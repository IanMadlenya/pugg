         Jarmila Novotna, a Czech-born lyric soprano who sang major roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1956, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She died of natural causes, said her daughter, Jarmila Packard.         Miss Novotna was widely considered one of the finest singing actresses of her time. Her interpretations of such roles as Donna Elvira, Euridice, Manon, Melisande, Antonia and Marenka were praised for their intelligence and lyrical grace. She also excelled in trouser roles, particularly Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus," Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier." On hearing her American debut in San Francisco in "Madama Butterfly" in 1939, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: "There is grace, warmth, communicative feeling in all that she does."  'Charming Simplicity'         She made her Metropolitan debut in "La Boheme" in 1940, singing with Jussi Bjoerling. The Times review noted her "charming simplicity, feeling and high artistic intelligence." That year Downes also praised her "great" Violetta at the Met: "She conceived the music, from first note to last, dramatically, and portrayed the character with an aristocratic sensibility and simplicity.         "The word and the tone were indissoluble; the phrasing was that of the finest musician."         In her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Miss Novotna sang 193 performances -- 142 in the opera house, the rest on tour -- and won consistent praise for her expressiveness and musicianship.         Her acting abilities and regal appearance also led to other offers: the director Max Reinhardt urged her to devote herself to the theater; the studio head Louis B. Mayer asked her to become a film star. During the course of her career, she appeared in Hollywood films ("The Great Caruso," "The Search"), on Broadway (as an unscrupulous concert singer in the 1953 drama "Sherlock Holmes") and on television (as Kim Stanley's mother in a postwar drama set in France). But she resisted all attempts to steer her away from singing, which was her first love.  Art as Beauty         "Of course there are many important things in life besides music," she said in a 1989 interview in Opera News, "but that doesn't make music unimportant. If you love music, what would life be without it -- can you imagine? Art is what brings beauty into life."         Miss Novotna studied with Emmy Destinn and made her debut at the age of 17 with the Prague National Opera. She continued her studies in Milan and became a member of the Vienna State Opera from 1933 to 1938, eventually singing opera and concerts in most of the major houses of Europe. The Met invited her to sing in 1928, but she did not want to be separated from her future husband, the Baron George Daubek, whom she married in 1931.         Toscanini brought her to the attention of the Met again after she sang Pamina under his direction in Salzburg in 1937. She came to New York in 1940, arriving, she noted years later, the day Hitler marched into Prague.  A Recording Re-released         During the war years she recorded "Songs of Lidice," in memory of the victims of the Nazi massacre. The recording, recently rereleased on CD by Supraphon, presents folk songs of her native land; the piano accompaniments are by Jan Masaryk, the son of the former president of Czechoslovakia.         Masaryk died in 1948, and the loss of his protection led to the nationalization of the Daubeks' 3,700-acre estate and castle. That same year, Miss Novotna appeared in Fred Zinnemann's film "The Search," as a mother seeking her lost son at the end of World War II.         Miss Novotna moved from Vienna to New York after her husband's death in 1981. She was frequently seen at opera performances and at events celebrating the art of singing.         In addition to her daughter, of New York City, she is survived by a son, George Daubek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Andrea Heinemann Simon, a community leader in Riverdale, the Bronx, died yesterday at her home there. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Joanna Walker.         Mrs. Simon served for more than 30 years on the board of directors of the Riverdale Mental Health Association. She also worked for the association as a fund-raiser. In addition, she was a director of the Riverdale Chapter of the United Nations Association.         Her husband, Richard L. Simon, was a co-founder of Simon & Schuster, the publishers. He died in 1960.         Mrs. Simon is survived by three daughters, Carly Simon, the singer and composer, Lucy Levine and Joanna Walker, all of Manhattan, and a son, Peter Simon of Chilmark, Mass.       
         Willie Mae Ford Smith, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Wednesday at the Tower Village Nursing Home in St. Louis. She was 89.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Anthony Heilbut, a friend and her recording producer.         Mother Smith, as she was widely known, was one of the first singers to perform in the blues-influenced gospel style created by Thomas A. Dorsey in the 1920's and 30's. Her deep contralto and flamboyant vocal flights made her a leading performer of the 1930's and 40's, and she was a major influence on singers like Mahalia Jackson.         Willie Mae Ford was born in Rolling Fork, Miss., 1 of 14 children in a musical family. She moved to St. Louis at the age of 12, and sang with family members in the Ford Sisters. In 1927, she married James Peter Smith and began a career as a soloist.         She started working with Dorsey's National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses in the early 1930's, and she became the director of the convention's Soloist's Bureau, evaluating and training gospel singers until the late 1980's. During the 1930's and 40's, she constantly toured the Midwest with her adopted daughter, Bertha, as accompanist. But while her style and showmanship were widely imitated, she did not make her first recording until 1950. She later recorded albums for the Nashboro, Savoy and Spirit Feel labels.         In 1972 she began to receive national recognition after an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival. She appeared in the 1981 gospel documentary film "Say Amen, Somebody," and received a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. She continued to perform regularly at the Lively Stone Apostolic Church in St. Louis until the early 1990's.         She is survived by her sisters Emma, Geneva and Georgie; a daughter, Jacqueline; a son, William; four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren, all of St. Louis.       
         Natalie Hall Rowe, a musical-comedy star and opera singer in New York and London in the 1920's and 30's, died last Friday at her home in Edgecomb, Me. She was 89.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Betty Gruendel of Edgecomb.         As Natalie Hall, she made her Broadway debut in the chorus of "Iolanthe" in 1926. A lyric soprano, she then played a variety of roles with the American Opera Company from 1928 to 1930, including Marguerite in "Faust" and the leads in "Carmen" and "Yolanda in Cyprus."         She appeared with her sister, Bettina, in "Three Little Girls" in 1931. The next year, she had roles in "Through the Years" and "Music in the Air."         Miss Hall won critical acclaim for her performance as the lead in "The Merry Widow" in Central City, Colo., in 1933. Later that year, she went to London to star in the West End production of "Ball at the Savoy." Returning to New York, she played in "Music Hath Charms," "Otello" and "Nights of Song" and in a production of "Showboat" on Randalls Island in 1938.         In the 1940's she lived in Hamilton, N.Y., where her husband, Edward C. Rowe, was a lawyer at Colgate University. In 1964 the couple moved to Maine, where Miss Hall appeared in many productions at the Brunswick Music Theater. Mr. Rowe died in 1974.         Miss Hall was born in Warwick, R.I.         She is survived by her daughter and a sister, Bettina Rubicam of Scottsdale, Ariz.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Herva Nelli, an Italian-born soprano who became a professional cook when her singing career ended, died yesterday at the Sharon Country Manor in Sharon, Conn. She was 85.         Her sister, Delfa, said the cause was leukemia.         Miss Nelli, a solid, able singer who was often called "the Toscanini soprano" because of her seven-year association with the conductor, was reared in Pittsburgh and made her debut in 1937 with the Salmaggi Opera in New York City. In 1947, after she sang in a concert version of "Otello" with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times that the timbre and quality of her voice "most touchingly communicated Desdemona's gentleness and purity of soul."         Over the next seven years she sang with the orchestra in several Verdi operas and went to Italy with Toscanini for the postwar reopening of La Scala opera house.         She made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1953 in "Aida" and sang many leading roles there. Her final performance was in 1962, in "Norma" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         Miss Nelli and her husband opened a restaurant near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1955. In 1970, after their divorce, she started to cater meals for a country club, then became a cook for Stephen and Jean Kennedy Smith.  She is survived by her sister, of Wingdale, N.Y.       
         Nadia Gray, an actress best known for her performance in Federico Fellini's 1961 film "La Dolce Vita," in which she did a striptease to entertain a roomful of bored party guests, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Henry R. Silverman, her stepson.         Ms. Gray, who often played elegant, aristocratic women, had her first big break in the theater when Noel Coward made her his co-star in the Paris production of his play "Present Laughter." Her success in that role brought her offers from British film makers. She subsequently appeared in "The Spider and the Fly" (1952) with Eric Portman, "Night Without Stars" (1953) with David Farrar and "Mr. Topaze" (1961) with Peter Sellers.         She went on to make films in France, Italy and the United States. Among her other screen credits are "La Parisienne" (1958) with Charles Boyer, "Candide" (1962) with Jean-Pierre Cassel, "The Crooked Road" (1965) with Robert Ryan, "The Naked Runner" (1967) with Frank Sinatra and "Two for the Road" (1967) with Audrey Hepburn.         Ms. Gray also had a career as a singer, appearing in clubs and on television and radio shows in the United States and abroad.         In addition to her stepson, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Herbert R. Silverman, and a stepdaughter, Karen Mayers of Washington.       
         Marion Williams, a pioneering gospel singer, died on Saturday at the Albert Einstein Medical Institute in Philadelphia. She was 66 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was vascular disease, said her record producer, Anthony Heilbut.         Miss Williams was a flamboyant singer who put her songs across with pure sustained tones, swooping phrases and deep growls. Her influence was heard throughout gospel music and in secular music as well. Little Richard has said her octave-leaping high whoops were the source for his vocals in "Tutti Frutti" and other songs, and Aretha Franklin recorded Miss Williams's two biggest hits, "Packin' Up" and "Surely God Is Able." Miss Williams performed in churches, at concerts and in nightclubs, and in 1993 she received a MacArthur Foundation grant and was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.         "When I'm singing, I get inspired by God," she said in a 1980 interview with The New York Times. "I call it 'the anointing.' It's an extra-special thing. When the inspiration of God is missing, I just rely on talent." In Church and on Broadway         Miss Williams was born in Miami in 1927 and grew up singing in sanctified churches, although she was also exposed to blues and jazz. In 1947 she joined the Clara Ward Singers, the preeminent gospel group of the 1950's, and soon became the lead singer. In 1958 she and other members of the Ward Singers started their own group, the Stars of Faith, and in 1961 they appeared on Broadway in "Black Nativity," a gospel musical by Langston Hughes.         Miss Williams began performing as a soloist in the mid-1960's, appearing at churches and colleges and touring the world. In 1966 the State Department sponsored her tour of Africa. She recorded for Savoy, Vee Jay, Columbia and Atlantic Records from the 1950's through the 1970's. In 1976, her album "Prayer Changes Things" won a Grand Prix du Disque in France.         In 1980, she made her first appearance in a club serving alcohol, singing a celebrated long engagement at the Cookery in Greenwich Village. From the mid-1980's onward, she made albums for Spirit Feel Records. She was active at the B. M. Oakley Memorial Church of God in Christ, in Philadelphia, as both a church mother and an occasional performer.         Miss Williams began to undergo dialysis regularly in 1988, but she continued to perform. In December 1991 she sang "Amazing Grace" in a Public Broadcasting Service program about the song. She appeared in the 1992 film "Fried Green Tomatoes," which was dedicated to her, and was the guest soloist in 1992 for the premiere of Wynton Marsalis's gospel-influenced jazz suite "In This House/On This Morning." On April 28 this year, she was inducted into the Philadelphia Walk of Fame.         Miss Williams is survived by her son, Robin, of Philadelphia; a brother, Isaac, of Miami, and three grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Collins, a singing star of the popular 1950's television show "Your Hit Parade" and a Tony nominee for the Broadway show "Follies" in 1971, died on Thursday at her home in Watervliet, N.Y. She was 67.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Melissa Holgate.         As a featured singer on "Your Hit Parade" from 1950 to 1957, Miss Collins was America's singing sweetheart, noted for her trademark high-necked blouses and such standard songs as "Too Young," "Shrimp Boats" and "Harbor Lights." The show was the television version of the long-running radio program "Lucky Strike Hit Parade" and featured the top tunes of the week performed by the show's cast in a variety of costumes and settings. Other members of the cast during Miss Collins's time included Snooky Lanson, Gisele MacKenzie, June Valli and Russell Arms.         Miss Collins, whose original name was Marjorie Chandler, was born on Nov. 18, 1926 in Windsor, Ontario. Her first career thoughts were for secretarial work, but when her parents entered her in a talent show in 1938, she won a wristwatch and a chance to sing on a children's radio program in nearby Detroit. She was such a hit that she stayed with the show for some time. Met Her Mentor at 16         In 1942, she was introduced to the band leader Raymond Scott, who advised her to take voice lessons for a year and then to sing for him again. She subsequently sang with his quintet and performed in jazz spots across the country. In 1949, Mr. Scott left his group to become director of the orchestra for the radio show "Your Hit Parade," and Miss Collins stayed on the road and ran the quintet. That meant doing the introductions as well as singing. Speaking Mr. Scott's lines, she was actually doing her first announcing.         "It was quite a terrifying experience," she said in a 1953 interview, but it took her closer to the earnest commercials that were to contribute to her fame.         She and Mr. Scott were married in 1952.         Early in 1950, the American Tobacco Company, sponsor of "Your Hit Parade" for Lucky Strike cigarettes, was looking for a new type of advertising commercial. Mr. Scott was commissioned to write some jingles, which eventually gained nationwide popularity, and he had Miss Collins sing them. The sponsor liked her voice and personal appearance and when televising "Your Hit Parade" was broached, she was selected for four trial telecasts. Impressed by this cheerful woman who told people to get happy by smoking a particular cigarette, the sponsor signed her to do the commercials and to be a featured singer when the show began its official run in October 1950. Letters From the Clergy         In a 1979 interview, Miss Collins was asked if she liked her girl-next-door image.         "Yes, because that's me, and you can't be what you aren't," she replied. "I was very protected when I was growing up, and there's a lot that I don't know. When I was on 'Hit Parade,' the bulk of my mail was from priests and nuns. They used to do sermons on all the good I was doing for American womanhood."         After "Your Hit Parade" went off the air, she did a stint on "'Candid Camera," from 1961 to 1963. In 1971 she was given a starring role in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies," singing one of the show's big songs, "Losing My Mind" and receiving a Tony nomination for her performance. She also had leading roles in stock companies and dinner-theater productions and gave concerts across the country. Plagued with asthma for years, she retired from performing in 1980.         She was also active for many years in the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and became a vice president of the organization in 1988.         Her two marriages, to Mr. Scott and to the singer Ron Holgate, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Holgate, who lives in Watervliet, she is survived by two other daughters, Elizabeth Adams, also of Watervliet, and Deborah Studebaker of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Janis Carter, an actress in film and theater, and the co-host of the television quiz show "Feather Your Nest," died on Saturday in Durham, N.C. She was 80 and had homes in Longboat Key, Fla., Durham and Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Julius Stulman.         Ms. Carter was born in Cleveland. She earned bachelor's degrees in English and music at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) and moved to New York to become an opera singer. For a time, she worked as a saleswoman at Bloomingdale's, wrote radio scripts for "Gangbusters" and sang in church choirs.         She first gained critical notice in the Broadway musical "DuBarry Was a Lady," with Ethel Merman and Bert Lahr. Two years later, Darryl F. Zanuck spotted her in "Panama Hattie" and signed her to a contract at 20th Century-Fox, changing her last name from Dremann.         In the 1940's and early 50's, she made a series of B films for Fox, Columbia and RKO, including "Cadet Girl" (1941) "The Girl in the Case" (1944), "Framed" (1947), "My Forbidden Past" (1951) and "Flying Leathernecks" (1952).         In the mid-50's she appeared with Bud Collyer as a host on the television show "Feather Your Nest."         She is survived by her husband.       
         Nancy Lancaster, an American-born socialite who had been an international influence on interior and garden design since the 1920's, died on Friday at her home near Little Haseley, Oxfordshire, England. She was 96.         She died in her sleep after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Lady Anne Tree.         A native of Virginia who moved to England in 1926, Nancy Lancaster was instrumental in creating what is popularly known as the English-country look. This school of interior decoration is characterized by sun-bleached chintz, vibrant wall colors, a casual mix of furniture from various historical periods and an atmosphere of disheveled coziness. John Fowler, Mrs. Lancaster's partner in the London design firm of Colefax & Fowler, called it "pleasing decay."         According to Robert Becker, whose biography of Mrs. Lancaster is to be published by Alfred A. Knopf next year, it was an esthetic fueled by memories of Southern plantation houses that had fallen into romantic disrepair after the Civil War. Among these was her grandfather's estate, Mirador, near Charlottesville. 'An Abstract Nostalgia'         "It was an abstract nostalgia that was particularly appealing to the British upper classes," Mr. Becker said. "Thanks to two world wars, they were losing their way of life, too, just as the Virginians had."         Born in 1897, Nancy Keene Perkins was a daughter of Lizzie Langhorne and T. Moncure Perkins, a meatpacking executive. Orphaned at the age of 15, she was raised by her aunt, Irene Langhorne Gibson, a celebrated beauty who was the original Gibson Girl, a symbol of American womanhood at the turn of the century. Another Langhorne aunt was Nancy, Viscountess Astor, the first woman elected to the House of Commons.         Though Mrs. Lancaster was co-owner of Colefax & Fowler from 1944 to the mid-1980's, she was not a professional decorator. "I'm agin decoratin'," she once said in a Tidewater drawl that remained undimmed after more than 65 years away from home. "I'm a percolator of ideas." The appearance of her own homes -- notably her London apartment's butter-yellow drawing room, completed in 1958 -- inspired generations of designers in Europe and the United States. Her followers include Sister Parish, Mark Hampton and Mario Buatta.         "She brought American vitality to stuffy British houses, which often looked like museums," Mr. Buatta said. "After Nancy blew into town, England loosened up and started looking more personal and lived-in." Cultivator of Roses         Mrs. Lancaster also revived interest in old-fashioned roses, which she cultivated at Ditchley Park, a 3,000-acre estate in Oxfordshire that was her home from 1933 to 1947. One of her last homes, Haseley Court, was the subject of a 1993 BBC television documentary, "An Englishwoman's Garden." She also advised on the restoration of Stratford Hall, a Virginia home of a relative, Robert E. Lee.         Nancy Lancaster's first husband was Henry Field, a grandson of Marshall Field, the department-store magnate. He died in 1918, six months after their wedding. Two years later, she married another Field grandson, Ronald Lambert Tree, who later became a Conservative member of Parliament. They divorced in 1947. She later wed another British politician, Col. Claud G. Lancaster. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Sought after by leading artists and photographers -- John Singer Sargent, Cecil Beaton, Baron De Meyer and Horst P. Horst all paid homage -- Mrs. Lancaster was a popular hostess for guests from American diplomats to the King and Queen of England.         Between 1940 and 1942, Winston Churchill spent many weekends at Ditchley Park, which was considered safer from Axis bombers than the Prime Minister's official country residence, Chequers.         In addition to her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lancaster is survived by a son, Michael Tree; a sister, Alice Winn; and two granddaughters, all of London.       
         Lillian Hayman, a Tony Award-winning actress and singer, died on Oct. 25 at her home in Hollis, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was a heart attack, said her sister, Coreania Carter.         Miss Hayman won a Tony in 1968 as best supporting actress for her performance in the musical "Hallelujah Baby." She appeared in many other Broadway productions, including "Kiss Me Kate," "Show Boat," "Kwamina," "70, Girls, 70," "No, No, Nanette" and "Porgy and Bess," with which she traveled for its entire three-and-a-half-year world tour. She also appeared in several Off Broadway plays, including "Dream About Tomorrow" and "Along Came a Spider."         Miss Hayman had a role in the soap opera "One Life to Live" for 17 years, as the character Sadie Gray, and was a regular on the short-lived "Leslie Uggams Show" in 1969. She also recorded a gospel album, "My Prayer," and appeared in the film "Purlie Victorious."         Lillian Irene Hayman was born in Maryland and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Wilberforce University in Ohio. She then studied music privately in New York where she became the director of several church choirs.         She is survived by her sister, of St. Albans, Queens.       
         Evelyn Anderson, believed to be the last surviving member of the troupe that danced with Josephine Baker in "La Revue Negre" in Paris in the 1920's, died on Oct. 29 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, her family said.         Miss Anderson was 18 and had worked as a dancer in several shows produced by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake when she was recruited to join a revue, as yet unnamed, going to Paris.         The troupe was formed by a wealthy Chicago woman, Caroline Dudley, who had backed other shows featuring black artists. The star of the revue was to have been a singer and dancer named Maude de Forest. Miss Baker came to the fore when an artist named Paul Colin featured her in a now-famous poster for the show, which the French producers decided to call "La Revue Negre." The show became an instant success and made Miss Baker an international star.         The revue was scheduled to go to Berlin and Moscow after the Paris engagement, but when Miss Baker broke her contract and went to the Folies Bergere, the company broke up. Miss Anderson was among those who chose to remain in Europe, and for the next 15 years she performed in revues and night clubs on the Continent.         When World War II broke out, she was working in the Netherlands, dancing in a cabaret in The Hague, according to Jean-Claude Baker's book about his adoptive mother, "Josephine: The Hungry Heart." When the Germans conquered the Netherlands, they deported her, her partner Harry Watkins and several of her friends.         They were interned first in the Netherlands and later moved to a camp in Germany. In 1943, they were released in a prisoner exchange and made their way back to the United States. In 1944, Miss Anderson married Robert Robbins, an orchestra leader in the Philadelphia area.         She is survived by two brothers, John and Thomas Anderson.       
         Norma Donaldson, whose sensuality and throaty voice entertained Broadway audiences, moviegoers and television viewers, died on Tuesday at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Hollywood Hills.         The cause was cancer, said her cousin, Lovely Hill Billups of Washington.         Ms. Donaldson, born in Harlem, became a nightclub singer, touring with Harry Belafonte early in her career. On the concert stage she appeared with performers including Lena Horne, Billy Daniels and Lionel Hampton.         Her most acclaimed appearance on Broadway came in 1976, when she took the girlishly nasal comedy lead of Miss Adelaide, the forever-unmarried show girl, in an all-black revival of Frank Loesser's "Guys and Dolls." Robert Guillaume played Nathan Detroit.         On Broadway she also starred as Missy in "Purlie" and as Evie in "No Place to Be Somebody," both opposite Mr. Guillaume. She was Clara in "The Great White Hope" in Washington and, as a replacement, on Broadway with Yaphet Kotto. She also performed in "The Sunshine Boys," "Bubbling Brown Sugar" and "Kiss Me Kate," among others.         In the movies, she was seen most recently in John Singleton's "Poetic Justice." Other appearances included roles in Robert Townsend's "Five Heart Beats," Sylvester Stallone's "Staying Alive" and Colin Higgins's "Nine to Five."         At her death Ms. Donaldson had the recurring role of Lilliebelle Barber on the CBS daytime series "The Young and the Restless." She appeared in prime-time dramas, as well as in guest roles in the series "All in the Family," "Archie Bunker's Place," "The Jeffersons," "General Hospital" and "Farrell for the People."         In addition to Ms. Billups, Ms. Donaldson is survived by her godmother, Longines Lewis of Mobile, Ala.; and two nieces, Jill B. Beltrans of Yorktown, N.Y., and Jina Billups of Manhattan.       
         Sally A. Knapp, a singer and actress who appeared in numerous productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, died on Tuesday at Gwinett County Hospital in Georgia. She was 68 and lived in Atlanta.         The cause was an aneurism, said Tedi Dreiser Godard, a friend.         Miss Knapp was a leading actress with Dorothy Raedler's Masque and Lyre Light Opera Company, which later became the American Savoyards. She starred in many of its productions, as well as in television commercials.         In 1980 Miss Knapp was a co-founder of the Southeastern Savoyards in Atlanta, and served as its artistic director through 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Holly Crumpton; a brother, Rue Knapp; a sister, Mary Lou DiNardo, and a granddaughter, Crystal, all of Atlanta.       
         Carmen McRae, the jazz singer known for her probing interpretations of lyrics and her bruised but unbowed point of view, died on Thursday evening at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         She had fallen into a semi-coma four days earlier, a month after being hospitalized for a stroke, said her secretary, Jan March. She withdrew from public performance in May 1991 after an episode of respiratory failure only hours after she completed an engagement at the Blue Note jazz club in New York.         Although Ms. McRae never reached the heights of popularity attained by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday, she was widely regarded as their artistic equal. In a prolific recording career that spanned nearly five decades, she had only two minor hits, both in the mid-1950's. But the scores of songs on she which stamped her bittersweet, gently mocking signature included "Alfie," "The Music That Makes Me Dance," "Guess Who I Saw Today?," "Blame It on My Youth," "Yesterdays" and "Mean to Me." In January, she received a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Fellowship award for lifetime achievement.         Ms. McRae was born in Harlem on April 8, 1920, one of four children of immigrants from the West Indies. Growing up in Brooklyn, she attended Julia Richman High School in Manhattan and received her musical grounding in five years of formal piano lessons.         Like many other jazz giants of her generation, she had her first break when she won an amateur talent contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It was there that she was discovered in 1939 by Irene Kitchings, who was then married to the jazz pianist Teddy Wilson. Through Wilson, who worked with Billie Holiday, Ms. McRae met the woman who became her biggest influence and who recorded Ms. McRae's song "Dream of Life."         "If Billie Holiday had never existed," Ms. McRae later recalled, "I probably wouldn't have, either."         Ms. McRae's parents, who opposed a show-business career, persuaded their daughter to take a secretarial course, and she spent two years in Washington doing clerical work for the Government. Returning to Brooklyn in 1943, she did office work by day while performing in clubs at night. Gradually music took over, and she began substituting for other singers in bands led by Benny Carter, Count Basie and Earl (Fatha) Hines. She eventually landed an 18-month engagement with a band led by Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, and in 1946 she made her recording debut with the band, singing under the name Carmen Clarke.         In Chicago, when the Ellington band broke up, Ms. McRae remained there and embarked on a solo career. A two-week engagement in a club as a singing pianist expanded to 17 weeks, and she ended up staying in Chicago three and a half years.         Her career took off when she returned to New York and developed an act as a stand-up singer at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, receiving enough notice to be named best new female singer by Down Beatmagazine.         Ms. McRae released her first solo album for Bethlehem in 1955, the same year she made her first recordings for Decca, where she remained until 1958. From there she moved to Kapp (1958-60) and Columbia (1960-62), then jumped to several smaller labels before ending up on Atlantic for five years (1967-71). Her longest record company affiliation was with Concord Jazz (1980-88). Her last two albums, for RCA, were tributes to Thelonious Monk and Sarah Vaughan.         In these four decades as a jazz star, Ms. McRae toured constantly. Although she left New York for Southern California in the late 1960's, she appeared in New York regularly, usually at the Blue Note, where she did two engagements a year through most of the 1980's.         From the moment she made her mark, Ms. McRae was recognized as a supremely insightful interpreter of lyrics.         "Every word is very important to me," she said. "Lyrics come first, then the melody. The lyric of a song I might decide to sing must have something that I can convince you with. It's like an actress who selects a role that contains something she wants to portray."         The singer's two marriages, to the be-bop drummer Kenny Clarke and the pianist Ike Isaacs, both ended in divorce. There was no immediate word on survivors.
