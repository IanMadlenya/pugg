         Mary Virginia Gaver, who championed the cause of school libraries in America, died Tuesday at the Roman Eagle Memorial Home in Danville, Va. She was 85 years old and died of Parkinson's disease, her family said.         Miss Gaver helped develop national school library standards in 1960 and headed a $1.1 million campaign promoting their adoption nationwide and creating eight model libraries.         She served as president of the American Library Association in 1966-67, the American Association of School Librarians in 1959-60 and the New Jersey School Library Association in 1954-55. Taught Librarians         She was also an educator of librarians at several universities. Her longest tenure was at Rutgers University, where she taught from 1954 to 1971.         Growing up in the cotton mill town of Schoolfield, Va., she accompanied her mother, a teacher, as she went door-to-door collecting $100 to start a school library. Mill company executives matched the donations.         Decades later Miss Gaver summarized what she saw as her mission in the title of a pamphlet she wrote: "Every Child Needs a School Library."         She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Randolph-Macon Women's College and bachelor of science and master's degrees from Columbia University, where she studied under a Carnegie fellowship. High School English Teacher         In the 1920's and 1930's she worked as a high school English teacher and librarian in Danville and served as technical director of a Federal Works Project Administration library program for Virginia.         She moved to New York to be a school librarian in Scarsdale from 1939 to 1942. She was a librarian and professor of library service at New Jersey State Teachers College in Trenton from 1942-54, with a two-year leave as a visiting professor at the University of Teheran and library adviser to Iran. She also taught at the University of Virginia and Emory University.         After her retirement from Rutgers, she served as a library consultant and later vice president of Bro-Dart Inc., a wholesale book supplier. She wrote and edited numerous articles and books on libraries.         Her survivors include a sister, Lydia Harvey, also of Danville.       
         Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, retired, a mathematician and pioneer in data processing who was a legendary figure among both computer scientists and industry executives, died New Year's Day at her home in Arlington, Va.         Admiral Hopper, who was 85 years old, had been in ill health recently, family members said, and died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes.         She had been in the Navy, as an active-duty officer or a reservist, since World War II, and received a special Presidential appointment to the rank of rear admiral in 1983. In 1982, with the retirement of Adm. Hyman J. Rickover, Admiral Hopper became the oldest officer on active duty in the armed service, which she remained until retiring herself in 1986.         Admiral Hopper made several vital contributions to the development of modern computing systems, including helping invent the Cobol programming language, which is still in widespread use in business.  Award from President         In September, President George Bush awarded her the National Medal of Technology "for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users." She was the first woman to receive the award individually.         At the time of her death she was a senior consultant to the Digital Equipment Corporation. She joined Digital in 1986, shortly after her retirement from the Navy.         "Grace took every opportunity to challenge people young and old to consider the infinite possibilities of technology," said Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital Equipment's president.         Admiral Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray on Dec. 9, 1906, in New York City. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale, she taught math at Vassar College, her alma mater, where she later became an associate professor. She was divorced in 1945 but kept her married name.         In 1949 she worked as a mathematician at the Eckert-Mauchly Corporation. The company was formed by Dr. John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in 1946 had developed one of the world's first electronic computers, ENIAC, at the University of Pennsylvania. Eckert-Mauchly was then building the Univac I, the first commercial electronic computer. The company was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation.         Earlier, in 1943, Dr. Hopper had joined the Navy. As a lieutenant assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University, she worked as a programmer on a calculating device called the Mark I, a precursor electronic computers.  Recalled by the Navy         Leaving the Navy in 1946, she remained at Harvard as a faculty member in the computation laboratory. She continued to work on early Navy computers and maintained her Naval career as a reservist. Although retired from the Navy reserve in 1966, then-Commander Hopper was recalled within a year to active duty to oversee a program to standardize the Navy's computer programs and languages.         In 1962, she was elected a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. In 1969, the Data Processing Management Association selected her as its first computer sciences "Man of the Year."         Her work led to the first practical compiler for modern computers. A compiler is a program that translates instructions written by a human programmer into more specific codes that can be directly read by a computer.         Among her many contributions, Admiral Hopper is known for coining the term "bug," which is widely used to refer to mysterious computer failures.         The first bug actually was -- a moth, as Admiral Hopper told the story. It was discovered one August night at Harvard in 1945 inside the Mark I.         "Things were going badly, there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long, glass-enclosed computer," she is quoted as saying. "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth. From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."         Like another Navy figure, Admiral Rickover, Admiral Hopper was known for her combative personality and her unorthodox approach.         A self-described "boat rocker," she once said in a speech that she hoped to live until the year 2000. "I have two reasons," she said. "The first is that the party on Dec. 31, 1999, will be a New Year's Eve party to end all New Year's Eve parties. The second is that I want to point back to the early days of computers and say to all the doubters, 'See? We told you the computer could do all that.' "         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Roger F. Murray II of New Hampshire, and a sister, Mary Murray Westcote of New Jersey.       
         Shirley Jenkins, a noted social work researcher, author and educator, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Jenkins wrote 10 books and was the founding director of the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice. The center is co-sponsored by Columbia University's School of Social Work and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. It seeks to integrate academic theory and clinical practice.         She taught at Columbia for 25 years until her retirement two years ago. She was chairwoman of Columbia's Advisory Committee for Ethnic Studies and served on its Commission on the Future of the University, the University Senate and the Faculty Executive Committee. Served on Several Panels         She was director of research training in social work and mental health for the National Institutes of Health from 1977 to 1988. She was also a member of the United States Department of Health and Human Services's expert panel, the New York State Advisory Committee on Refugee Mental Health and the New York City Task Force on Minorities in Child Care.         Among the issues she studied for government and private agencies were cultural factors in providing social services to new immigrants, family welfare programs, foster care, Social Security and the shortchanging of minorities and the poor in the allocation of park and recreation services.         Born Shirley Presberg in New York City, she earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College, a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from New York University.         Early in her career she focused on international affairs. From 1944 to 1948 she was the associate editor of Far Eastern Survey, a journal. From 1948 to 1950 she was a political officer for the United Nations Department of Security Council Affairs. She also wrote "American Economic Policy Toward the Philippines" (Stanford University, 1954).         Her husband, David, died in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Peter, of Queens and Ian of Manahttan, and three grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Shurr, who performed in the 1920's and 30's with such pioneering American modern dance companies as Denishawn, the Humphrey-Weidman Concert Company and the early Martha Graham company, died on Thursday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 88 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Dr. Rachael Yocom, a friend.         Born in Riga, Latvia, Miss Shurr came to the United States as a child. Her first professional fee, as she later described it, was a penny she earned dancing in the streets with an organ grinder whose music she liked. She began her formal dance training at the Denishawn school of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn and also studied with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Martha Graham. Taught Notable Figures         She danced with the Denishawn company from 1925 to 1927, leaving to join the earliest Humphrey-Weidman company, with which she danced from 1927 to 1929. She left to teach at the Graham school, corralling students at other studios for Miss Graham's first classes for adults. Miss Shurr joined the Graham company in 1930, dancing in many Graham classics in her eight years there. Among them was "Primitive Mysteries," which she helped Miss Graham revive in 1982.         Miss Shurr left the Graham troupe to perform with May O'Donnell, another company member, with whom she opened a dance studio in New York City; students there included Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino, who later founded the Joffrey Ballet. In the early 1940's she received bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education, specializing in dance, from San Francisco State College and the University of Oregon, respectively.         Miss Shurr taught at the High School of Performing Arts in New York for more than two decades, serving as chairman of the dance department for three years. A tiny woman with a robust sense of humor, she established a reputation as a tough but loyal and influential teacher. Her students included the entertainers Ben Vereen and Liza Minnelli. She also was assistant choreographer for the Broadway musicals "Sadie Thompson" (1944) and "Top Banana" (1951).         Miss Shurr retired in 1971 but continued to work sporadically as a rehearsal coach. She was a dance adviser for the Arizona Commission on the Arts and directed the University of Utah's Opportunity Theater and Dance Workshop, a summer program. Last year she was named an Arizona Dance Treasure by the Arizona Dance Arts Alliance.         She is survived by her brother, George, of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Uris, a Broadway and Hollywood actress and voice teacher known professionally as Dorothy Tree, died yesterday at the Actor's Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 85 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Joseph Uris of Manhattan.         Mrs. Uris, who was born in Brooklyn, started her acting career in the late 1920's by playing a succession of parlor maids on Broadway. Her best-known film roles were the mother of Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien) in "Knute Rockne: All American" (1940), and Louis Calhern's invalid wife in "The Asphalt Jungle" (1950). Mrs. Uris was also a founding member of the Screen Actor's Guild.         Educated at Cornell and Teachers College of Columbia University, she taught voice and English diction at the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music.         She published four books, including "Everybody's Book of Better Speaking" and "To Sing in English."         In addition to her son, she is survived by a sister, Mimi Shapiro of Manhattan.       
         Ronnie Paris, a playwright, novelist and teacher, died on Feb. 4 at Kingston Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. She was 67 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Bearsville, N.Y.         She died of an aneurysm, said her son Peter Stein of New Haven.         Ms. Paris's plays have been produced in New York and regional theaters. They include "Yes, Yes, No, No," "Love Gotta Come by Saturday Night" and "The Killing Time."         Ms. Paris, who was born in Manhattan, earned degrees in drama from the University of California at Los Angeles and Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt. She was playwright in residence at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and taught at the School of Visual Arts and the New School in Manhattan.         In addition to her son Peter, she is survived by another son, Alexander Stein of Manhattan; a brother, William Paris of Nashville, and two granddaughters.       
         Paula Ruth Oboler Schwartz, a psychotherapist, social worker and civil rights advocate, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. Her family would not give her age.         She died of cancer, her family said.         In the 1960's she was a caseworker for the Suffolk County Social Services Department, worked for the National Council on Aging and was the community relations director for the Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality.         In the 1970's she was the social-services coordinator for the Community Affairs Department in Islip, L.I., for two years and taught at Adelphi's School of Social Work for six years. Her psychotherapy practice began in 1975 and continued until her death.         Over the years she also worked as a consultant for the American Foundation for the Blind and Mount Sinai Medical Center. She also organized conferences on bereavement for Yeshiva University.         She was born in Chicago and grew up in Queens. After graduating from the University of New Mexico, she earned a master's degree in social work at Adelphi University.         Her husband, Gerald Schwartz, a chemist and industrial hygienist, is dead. Her companion for the last several years was Paul Secchia.         Surviving are two sons, Steven, of Huntington Station, L.I., and Roy, of Kentfield, Calif., and one grandchild.       
         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.         Then she returned to the university's law school, becoming its third female graduate. She worked in her father's firm, then married Reuben Oscar Everett and worked with him. Later she was a partner in the firm of Everett and Hancock. Her practice was mostly probate, real estate and family law.         She served 20 years on the Durham City Council after being elected in nonpartisan balloting. She was active in the real estate business and was a founder of WRDC-TV in Raleigh, N.C. She was also an elder in the First Presbyterian Church.         Surviving are her son, Robinson O. Everett of Durham, retired chief judge of the United States Court of Military Appeals, and three grandsons.       
         Angela Carter, a novelist and short-story writer, died at her home in London on Sunday. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for Farrar, Straus & Giroux, her publisher in New York.         Ms. Carter's work was widely praised in Britain, although less widely known in the United States. She was the author of more than a half-dozen macabre novels and a polemical study of the Marquis de Sade, "The Sadeian Woman."         Her novels included "The Magic Toyshop," "Several Perceptions" and "Nights of the Circus." A number of her works were regarded as fairy tales with modern morals. Wrote for Radio and Films         British critics often described Ms. Carter's writing style as "magic realism," but she believed the label was not quite accurate. In a 1986 interview with The New York Times, she said: "It's more realism than not. I can't define it until after it's done except that it is definitely fiction. It's more in the genre of Latin American writers like Garcia Marquez and Borges."         Whatever the label, Ms. Carter's interest in fantasies, fairy tales and dreams was lifelong. She wrote radio scripts, short stories, children's books and screenplays, one of which became the 1984 film "The Company of Wolves." Her 1991 novel, "Wise Children," was about the illegitimate twin daughters of a celebrated Shakespearean actor.         Ms. Carter was born in 1940 in Eastbourne. She began her writing career as a journalist on a South London weekly, The Croydon Advertiser. Later, she studied English literature at the University of Bristol, then began to write cultural criticism for New Society, The New Statesman and other publications.         From 1976 to 1978, Ms. Carter was a fellow in creative writing at Sheffield University in England, and in 1980 and 1981 she was a visiting professor in the writing program at Brown University in Providence, R.I. She also taught at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.         She is survived by her husband, Mark Pearce, and a son, Alexander.       
         Jane Pickens Hoving, a popular singer on Broadway, radio and television for 20 years and later an organizer in numerous philanthropies and society events, died on Friday at her home in Newport, R.I.         She was 83 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Hoving was the musical leader of the Pickens Sisters, a trio born on a Georgia plantation that reached national stardom in the 1930's with its own radio show, concert tours and records.         The group earned $1 million in five years but dissolved when two sisters dropped out to get married and a fourth, who was the group's manager, also departed.         Mrs. Hoving pursued her music career alone and had wide-ranging success, from musical comedy to opera and nightclub engagements as well as her own shows on NBC radio and ABC television. The World-Telegram said in 1940: "She's probably the most beautiful woman on Broadway with a voice."         She frequently performed benefits for charitable causes, including events for orphans, hospitals, youths, veterans and the disabled. When her career tapered off in the late 1950's, she turned to running hundreds of fund-raising affairs. Among her favorite causes were the Salvation Army and research on heart disease and cerebral palsy, a condition that afflicted her daughter.         She became a noted figure at balls and other society events in New York City, Long Island and Newport. After her career peaked she was married twice to prominent businessmen. First was William C. Langley, a Wall Street broker. After he died, she married Walter Hoving, who had owned Tiffany & Company and Bonwit Teller. He died three years ago.         In 1972 she ran as the Republican-Conservative challenger to United States Representative Edward I. Koch in the Silk Stocking district on the East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Hoving also painted. Flowers were her favorite subject, roses in particular. She exhibited in galleries and sold dozens of paintings for charity.         The Pickens sisters were born in Macon, Ga., and grew up there and in Atlanta. Their parents taught them to harmonize. Their father, a cotton broker, played the piano and their mother sang.         At first the sisters sang for friends, then at churches and schools. The family moved to Park Avenue in Manhattan in 1932, and a test recording for Victor made such an impression with radio executives that they hired the sisters unseen. Promoted as Three Little Maids From Dixie, they appeared in "Thumbs Up" on Broadway and in a movie, "Sitting Pretty." Serious About Her Music         Mrs. Hoving, who arranged the group's numbers, was the most serious about music. She studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and the Fontainbleau in France and won fellowships at the Juilliard School. Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.

Several times she dropped out of public appearances to resume formal training.         She sang in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 in a cast that included Fanny Brice and Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1940 she played opposite Ed Wynn in "Boys and Girls Together" on Broadway. Brooks Atkinson's review said she had "a most attractive voice."         A turning point came in the 1940's when, unsatisfied with her career, she consulted Robert Alton, a music arranger. He told her that she came across as aloof, which he attributed to her feeling defensive. His analysis was a revelation. "I woke up the next morning absolutely healed," she said. "That wall was just gone."         In 1949 she won raves for starring in the lead of "Regina," the musical version of "The Little Foxes." One review said her performance was "in every way admirable." Jack Gould wrote that she "sings and acts with the ferocity of a poisonous snake."         An early marriage to Russell Clark ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Marcella Clark McCormack of Newport and Manhattan, and a sister, Patti Shreve of Bethlehem, Pa.       
         Marguerite Ross Barnett, who as president of the University of Houston was the first black woman to lead a major American university, died yesterday at Maui Memorial Hospital in Wailuku, Hawaii. She was 49 years old.         She had a blood disorder involving hypoglycemia and metastatic cancer, said Timothy Maloney, the hospital administrator. Dr. Barnett was on medical leave from the University of Houston, where she had been president since 1990. She was visiting Hawaii with her husband, Walter E. King, on a trip to where they had spent their honeymoon.         Before becoming president at Houston, Dr. Barnett had been an administrator at other major universities, including the City University of New York. She had a reputation as a successful fund-raiser and a pragmatic academic who urged that urban universities play a dominant role in spurring economic growth and solving social problems in the same way that land-grant colleges of a century ago did in developing America's agricultural economy.  Seeking Stronger Links         "What will characterize the superb 21st century university," she said at her inaugural in 1990, "will be its ability to manifest and focus areas of unquestioned institutional excellence on the challenging issues of the day."         Her views were representative of a substantial shift in higher education as universities, once isolated from their locales, sought stronger connections to their surroundings. And in many ways, Dr. Barnett was seen as representing a new generation of educational leader. While she had access to politicians and business leaders, she also worked to reach out to the public schools where she worked.         As vice-chancellor for academic affairs at the City University of New York from 1983 to 1986, she was instrumental in establishing a program to help poor high school students make the transition to college and good jobs. She instituted a similar program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, where she was chancellor from 1986 to 1990, and did the same in Houston.         Houston is a public university with 33,000 students that performs $45 million a year in scientific research. It has become especially well known for its work in superconductivity. Recording Firsts         In 1989, Dr. Barnett was considered a leading candidate to replace Chancellor Richard R. Green of the New York City schools after Dr. Green died. The position went to Joseph A. Fernandez.         When she was named the first black and the first woman to be president of the University of Houston, there were few other women in charge of colleges that were neither historically black nor all female, a situation that still exists. The only woman to lead a campus larger than the University of Houston is Donna Shalala, who is chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which has 38,000 students.         But Dr. Barnett constantly tried to play down the racial distinction of her position. When interviewers persisted in asking her how it felt to be the first black woman to head the University of Houston, she would turn to her assistant, Wendy H. Adair, and ask "Well, how does it feel to be the first red-haired associate vice president of the university?" That usually ended the conversation.         During her brief tenure in Houston, Dr. Barnett became a leading spokeswoman for urban universities and university-driven economic development. She also played a key role in raising more than $150 million for her institution, including a donation of more than $50 million from an alumnus, John Moores, one of the largest gifts ever made to a publicly financed university.         Dr. Barnett was born in Charlottesville, Va., on May 21, 1942. She graduated from Antioch College in 1964 and received her master of science and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Chicago. She taught at the University of Chicago and at Princeton, Howard and Columbia universities before turning to university administration.         She was a member of the boards of the Student Loan Association and the Educational Testing Service. Last July she was the only university representative named to the President's Commission on Environmental Quality, a group that will recommend ways to slow the destruction of the environment without restricting business excessively.         Dr. Barnett is survived by Mr. King; her daughter by a previous marriage, Amy Barnett, of New York City, and her mother, Mary Eubanks, of Houston.       
         Shirley R. Levittan, an Acting State Supreme Court judge from 1974 until she retired last year, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pemphigus vulgaris, a rare skin disease, a court spokeswoman said.         Before her service on the State Supreme Court, Justice Levittan sat on New York City's Criminal Court and Civil Court, where she was first appointed in 1969. Before her appointment, she was a law clerk to Justice Samuel H. Hofstadler of State Supreme Court.         Judge Levittan, who was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 8, 1918, graduated from Barnard College in 1939 and received a master's degree in French literature a year later at Syracuse University. During World War II, she was attached to the Office of Strategic Services in Paris, London and Germany. She also worked as the executive assistant to the Principal of the Ramaz School, a Jewish day school on Manhattan's East Side. Taught French and English         After traveling and teaching English and French, she entered New York Law School, where she got a law degree in 1956. She worked for several years in private practice and was appointed to several state and city commissions, including the Temporary Commission on the Courts, where she drafted reports on the Family Court and adoption as well as drafted proposed legislation.         Justice Levittan served as an officer of the New York Women's Bar Association and was a member of the New York city and state bar associations and the National Association of Women Lawyers.         During her judicial career, she wrote and lectured often on the Constitution, adoption, pornography, alimony and divorce and the rights of children.         The judge, who was not married, is survived by a sister-in-law, Olive Levittan of Halifax, Nova Scotia.       
         Anne Pappenheimer Forbes, a noted endocrinology researcher and clinician, died on Tuesday at her home in Milton, Mass. She was 80 years old.         She died of Hodgkin's disease, her family said.         Dr. Forbes was chosen in 1939 as the associate of Dr. Fuller Albright, the chief of endocrinology at the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.         They and their colleagues helped develop endocrinology. She participated in the identification of many diseases, including Forbes-Albright Syndrome, a pituitary gland ailment.         She became a professor at the medical school and a doctor at the hospital, where she helped create the Ovarian Dysfunction Clinic.         She worked with several hospitals in Paris in 1954 and 1955 and taught at the Pahlevi University in Shiraz, Iran, from 1967 to 1969.         After retiring in 1980, she took up gardening and raising ponies and sheep, shearing the wool herself and spinning and dyeing it by hand.         Dr. Forbes was born in New York City. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1932 and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1936 and interned at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1936 to 1938.         Surviving are her husband, William H.; three daughters, Beatrice F. Manz of Milton and Andrea F. Schoenfeld and Elise F. Pachter, both of Washington; two sons, Peter M. of Milton and Anthony W. of Belmont, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two brothers, Alwin M. Pappenheimer of Watertown, Mass., and John R. Pappenheimer of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Shirley Ullman Wedeen, a Brooklyn College educator and past chairwoman of the City University's Faculty Senate, died on Thursday at home in Brooklyn.         She was 65 years old and died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Wedeen taught education courses at Brooklyn College since 1948 and was also assistant dean of students from 1966 to 1968.         Her academic specialty was reading skills. She created the first remedial reading program in the City University system and ran it from 1961 to 1964. She also wrote two books, "College Remedial Reader" (Putnam, 1958) and "Advanced College Reader (Putnam, 1963).         She was elected chairwoman of the Faculty Senate for the entire City University from 1986 to 1990, and in that post sat as an ex-officio member on the university's Board of Trustees. She had also served as the Senate's vice chairwoman for four years and its Governance Committee chairwoman for two years.         Dr. Wedeen graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946. At New York University she earned a master's degree in guidance counseling in 1947 and a doctorate in psychology in 1951.         Surviving are her husband, Dr. Peter Wedeen; two sons, Dr. Van Wedeen of Boston, and Dr. Glenn Wedeen of Manhattan, and her father, Hugo Ullman of Brooklyn.       
         Elinor White Montgomery, until recently the board chairwoman of the New York City School Volunteer Program, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Montgomery's volunteer work also included her serving as a trustee of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and the Thacher School in Ojai, Calif. She also served on committees of the Environmental Defense Fund.         The school volunteer program includes a reading project in which hundreds of New Yorkers, including celebrities like Mike Wallace and Christopher Reeve, read aloud to third graders to help spur their interest in reading.         She was born in Oyster Bay, L.I. She graduated from Smith College and for several years taught at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, George C., an investment banker; a daughter, Diana, of Manhattan; two sons, George, of Riverside, Conn., and Jonathan, of Manhattan; a sister, Sheila English of New Haven; a brother, Alexander White of Manhattan and Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Ellen H. Johnson, an influential art historian and curator who taught at Oberlin College in Ohio for 38 years, died yesterday at her home in Oberlin. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said Elizabeth A. Brown, the curator of modern art at the museum.         At the time of her death, Miss Johnson was emerita professor of art at the college and honorary curator of modern art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin.         On a national level, Miss Johnson was a powerful force in the promotion of contemporary art. She gave the work of several prominent New York artists early exposure through her curatorship of the Allen Art Museum's well-known Young Americans series. She was the first to show the black-striped paintings that established Frank Stella's reputation, and she also exhibited works by Claes Oldenburg, Larry Poons and Bruce Nauman before the artists were widely known. Mr. Oldenburg's first site-specific sculpture, "Three Way Plug," was commissioned by Miss Johnson in 1970 for the Oberlin campus.         Miss Johnson's persistence in seeking out young artists and urging acquisition of their work helped make the Allen Museum one of the country's leading institutions in the contemporary art field. And generations of students, among them Agnes Gund, now the president of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, were influenced by the popular course in modern art that she initiated at Oberlin.         Miss Johnson left her eclectic art collection, ranging from Cezanne to the American contemporary artist Judy Pfaff, to the Allen Art Museum, where it is currently on view. In her honor, the main portion of an addition to the museum, designed by Robert Venturi and opened in 1977, was named the Ellen Johnson Gallery of Modern Art.         Ellen Hulda Elizabeth Johnson was born on Nov. 25, 1910, in Warren, Pa. Her affiliation with Oberlin began early. She earned both her undergraduate and master's degrees there, and went on to postgraduate study at Uppsala university in Stockholm and the Sorbonne in Paris.         After a short stint as a lecturer and cataloguer at the Toledo Museum of Art, she returned to Oberlin in 1938 as a part-time instructor, and soon became a member of the regular teaching faculty. Her interest in Scandinavian art also led her to serve as visiting professor in the field at the University of Wisconsin in 1950-51, and to teach American art at Uppsala University in 1960.         In Oberlin, Miss Johnson lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright house, built for another owner between 1948 and 1950. Over a period of years, she painstakingly restored it and it became a showcase for her collection. She bequeathed the Wright house to Oberlin.         She is survived by a sister, Evelina Johnson McAvoy, of Erie, Pa., and a brother, Harry Johnson, of Warren.       
         Catherine Wolkonsky, a French and Russian teacher for 50 years and founding chairman of the Slavic Department at the State University of New York at Albany, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 96 years old and lived in Spring Valley, N.Y.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Born into a landowning family in St. Petersburg, she came to the United States in 1924. She taught French in Cooperstown, N.Y., until World War II, when Cornell University started training Army officers in Russian. She became the only woman on the faculty then. She was chairman and professor of Russian at Vassar College from 1946 to 1961, after which she led the Slavic Department at SUNY, Albany, until 1972.         Mrs. Wolkonsky continued to teach at the Russian Summer School at Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., until 1985, when she was 90 years old.         She is survived by her daughter, Maria Marr, of Spring Valley, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Mary Ann Herman, a leading folk-dance teacher and an authority on folk-dance traditions, died on Monday at her home in North Babylon, L.I. She was 79 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her husband, Michael Herman.         With the idea that dancing was for everyone, Mr. and Mrs. Herman helped to introduce several generations of American students to the richness of folk dances.         "If you can walk, you can learn to dance," Mrs. Herman said in an interview in 1979.         The Hermans seemed never to tire of learning about dances from many cultures and, in their teaching, they emphasized not only the spatial patterns of dances, but also their underlying emotional significance.         Mrs. Herman, who was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, married Mr. Herman in 1930. They supervised folk dancing at the American Commons of the New York World's Fair in 1939. They taught 46 dances from 16 nations when they toured Japan for six weeks under the auspices of the State Department in 1956.         The Hermans directed their own school and dance center, Folk Dance House, from 1950 to 1970. In recent years, Mrs. Herman remained active as a teacher, using her home as headquarters, and she taught every summer at Folk Dance Camp, in Bridgton, Me.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Alexander Bodnar of Floral Park, L.I.       
         Eve Merriam, an award-winning poet, playwright and author of more than 50 books for adults and children, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Merriam's work ranged from light-hearted verse, to an Obie-winning musical about sexism, to a theater piece on pioneer women presented at the White House, to poems on inner-city poverty that spurred calls to ban the book from schools and libraries. Honors From Teachers         Most of her books were poetry, fiction and nonfiction for children, and her work was honored by the National Council of Teachers of English. Her work included "It Doesn't Always Have to Rhyme" (Atheneum, 1964), "Blackberry Ink" (Morrow, 1985) and "Halloween ABC" (Macmillian, 1986).         Her musical "The Club," was staged by Tom O'Horgan in 1976. It portrayed men in a private club making derogatory remarks about women -- with the men played by actresses.         "Out of Our Fathers' House," her portrayal of prominent American women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was presented at the White House in 1978 and shown on public television's "Great Performances" series.         Her book of urban poems, "The Inner City Mother Goose" (Simon & Schuster, 1969), drew attacks from a judge, police officials and others who said it glamorized crime and denigrated people with lines like "Run, run father, go away; Welfare worker is due today." She defended the book as misunderstood; others praised its realism. Feminism Was a Theme         Feminism was an early and recurring theme in her works, including "After Nora Slammed the Door: the Women's Unfinished Revolution" (World, 1964) and a children's book, "Mommies At Work" (Knopf, 1960). For CBS television she wrote "We the Women" the first network documentary on women's rights. She worked on programs to eliminate sexism in schools in Minneapolis and Connecticut.         Her word play and social commentary often displayed incisive wit. Her book "Figleaf" (Lippincott, 1960) punctured the fashion industry with a glossary of garment gab that defined exclusive as "a product offered to the broadest possible mass market" and timeless as "a style that remains fashionable for more than one season."         Born in Philadelphia with the given name Eva Moskovitz, she grew up enjoying Gilbert and Sullivan, reciting poetry and writing her own verses. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937.         Under the pen name of Eve Merriam, she held a variety of jobs in the 1940's, including that of an advertising writer, a CBS radio script writer, and a poetry program host on WQXR. Her first published book of poems, "Family Circle" (Yale University, 1946) won Yale's Younger Poets Prize, and in 1949 she won a Collier's prize for fiction. Taught Short-Story Writing         She taught short-story and critical writing at City College for four years in the 1960's and dramatic writing at New York University for several years in the 1980's.         She served on the Tony nominating committee and was an officer of the Dramatists Guild and Authors League.         Two of her books will be published this fall, and she recently finished a series of poems with musical background.         Her fourth husband, Oscar-winning screenwriter Waldo Salt, died in 1987. Her prior marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are two sons, Dee Michel of Los Angeles and Guy Michel of Brooklyn; a brother, Lou Martin of Wyncote, Pa., and a sister, Helen Abramson of North Miami Beach.       
         Louise Speers Croix, a chemist who worked on anesthetics, died on Monday at the King James Care Center in Chatham Township, N.J. She was 72 years old and lived in Summit, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said a friend, Walter Mac Williams of Bernardsville.         Dr. Croix was born in Nanking, China, where her Presbyterian-missionary parents taught at the university. She graduated from Vassar College in 1940 with a chemistry major and earned her Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University in 1949.         She started a 35-year-career in 1949 with the Ohio Chemical and Surgical Division of the Air Reduction Company. Working in its laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., she specialized in anesthetics and related products. She retired in 1984. The company now is the Airco Gases Division of Britain's BOC Group.         She is survived by her brother, James Speers of Pensacola, Fla., and a sister, Elizabeth Bagley of Rock Hill, S.C.       
         Edna Simon Levine, a psychologist who founded many programs to help deaf people, died on April 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart ailment, a friend said.         Dr. Levine devoted her career to the problems of people with impaired hearing as an advocate, author, teacher, researcher, clinician and trainer of other professionals.         She organized the first comprehensive dictionary of sign language in 1964, which standardized the signs. She formed the Deaf Repertory Theater, helped create the Foundation for the Deaf and worked on adapting telephones for the deaf, including experiments with video telephones.         As a psychologist, Dr. Levine focused on helping deaf people cope with feelings of social isolation from hearing people. Directed U.N. Program         She directed a 1972 United Nations Task Force on Deafness and a 1974 national conference on training psychological workers for the deaf. She initiated the New York State Psychiatric Institute's mental health program for the deaf and founded New York University's research and training center for deafness rehabilitation, a forerunner of centers elsewhere.         Among her books were "Youth in a Soundless World" (New York University, 1956), "Psychology of Deafness" (Columbia University, 1960) and "Lisa and Her Soundless World" (Human Sciences, 1974), which was chosen as the children's book of the year by the Child Study Association of America. Her other honors included an honorary doctorate from Gallaudet University, which educates deaf students.         She was a past president of the Psychology Commission of the World Federation for the Deaf and a former board member of the American Psychological Association, the American Hearing Society, the Inter-Branch Library Association of New York and the New York League for the Hard of Hearing.         Dr. Levine, who was not deaf, was born in New York City and got started in the field after she trained as a teacher at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate in psychology at New York University, where she later taught educational psychology for 15 years. She also earned a master's in special education at Columbia.         Her husband, Dr. Matthew Levine, a psychiatrist, is deceased. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Han Schroeder, an architect, interior designer and educator, died on March 20 in the Boerhaave Clinic in Amsterdam. She was 73 years old and lived in Richmond.         She died after a short illness, said Janet De Cecilia, the coordinator of the interior design program at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I., where Ms. Schroeder had taught.         Ms. Schroeder was born in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Her family lived in Schroeder House, a landmark De Stilj house designed in 1924 by the architect Gerrit Rietveld, with whom Ms. Schroeder later worked, in collaboration with her mother, Truss Schroeder-Schraeder, an interior designer. From 1972 to 1987, Ms. Schroeder was the consulting architect for the restoration of the house, now a museum. Two of her drawings for the restoration are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Before immigrating to the United States in the early 1960's, she had her own architecture and interior design office in Amsterdam. In 1964 she settled on Long Island to teach interior design at Adelphi University and the Parsons School of Design, and three years later she was appointed professor at the New York Institute of Technology. In 1981 she moved to Richmond, where she taught at Virginia Commonwealth University until retiring as professor emerita in 1988. She was one of the first women to have their work represented in the archives of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Va.         She is survived by a brother, Binnert, of the Hague.       
         Stowe Whitman Hausner, a prominent authority on social work, died on Saturday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Hausner, a 1944 graduate of Hunter College, was a founding director of the social services division at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, and chief social worker for the Westchester County Community Health Board.         In the late 1960's she became a program manager in the alcohol, mental health, and drug division of the National Institute of Mental Health, supervising the Federal agency's programs in the New York metropolitan area, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Later, she taught social work at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and maintained an active practice in cognitive therapy.         She is survived by her husband, Gabriel; a son, Jeffrey, of Arlington, Mass.; a daughter, Jan Doughery of Sedona, Ariz; a brother, Martin Whitman of New York City; a sister, Judge Phyllis Beck of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.       
         Phyllis Q. Blundell, a British sculptor and ceramist, died on March 24 at the A. O. Fox Hospital Nursing Home in Oneonta, N.Y. She was 102 years old and had lived at the nursing home for six years.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Jeanine Peterson, a friend.         Miss Blundell came to the United States in 1928 and worked in New York City until 1970. In the 1930's she was commissioned to do busts of Anna Roosevelt, the daughter of Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt; Lily Pons, the opera singer, and Rubin Goldmark, a composer who taught in the 1930's at the Juilliard School. In the 1950's she was president of the New York Society of Ceramic Arts and her work was exhibited widely in New York galleries and at the Cooper Union Museum.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Thelma Saks Bradford Ingersoll, an artist and the widow of the editor and publisher Ralph A. Ingersoll, died on Saturday at her home in West Cornwall, Conn. She was 81 years old and died of kidney failure, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Ingersoll, who was born in Manhattan, taught crafts at the Henry Street Settlement House and the City and Country School in Manhattan. In her own work, she specialized in ceramic pots, vases, bowls and plates in an Art Deco style.         She was married for 32 years to Francis Scott Bradford, a noted painter, until his death in 1961. In 1964 she married Mr. Ingersoll, an author and the former managing editor of The New Yorker and publisher of Time and a founder of Fortune and Life magazines, the newspaper PM and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. He died in 1985.         She is survived by a sister, Ethel Montague of Mill Valley, Calif.       
         Lydia Joel, the former editor in chief of Dance Magazine and head of the dance department at the School of Performing Arts, died on Sunday at New York Hospital She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, said her husband, Edwin Miller.         As teacher and journalist, Miss Joel helped to increase appreciation of dance as an art and to raise standards of dance writing and training. Appointed editor in chief of Dance Magazine in 1952, she began to emphasize serious criticism, essays, photographic features and foreign reports. As a result, a publication that had previously been read largely by performers and teachers came to appeal to the general dance audience.         Through her early teaching activities in Texas, she acknowledged the importance of fostering dance across America. And at the School of Performing Arts in New York, she supervised a program that prepared young people for professional careers.  Studied Two Methods         Miss Joel, whose maiden name was Tarnower, was born in New York City. She received a bachelor's degree in English from New York University and did additional graduate work at Cornell University. She studied ballet at the School of American Ballet and modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and Hanya Holm, two leaders of the German modern dance that flourished before World War II. She also attended summer sessions of the Bennington (Vt.) School of Dance, the forerunner of today's American Dance Festival.         At Bennington in 1937, Miss Joel danced in the premiere of "Trend," Miss Holm's monumentally scaled depiction of social conflicts. In New York that same year, Miss Joel appeared in Max Reinhardt's production of "The Eternal Road."         She taught in 1938 at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and from 1938 to 1944 at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she headed her own company.         Her first husband was the conductor Gerhard Joel; he died in 1946 but she retained Joel as her professional name. She married Mr. Miller, the entertainment editor of Seventeen magazine, in 1953.         Miss Joel joined the staff of Dance Magazine in 1947, working in the editorial and advertising departments. When she left the publication in 1969, the staff, under her guidance, had grown from 4 to 15 people.         Miss Joel directed the dance department of the School of Performing Arts from 1973 until her retirement in 1984, producing the high school's annual concerts and arranging a performance by 12 of its students at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982.         She served on the board of directors of the American College Dance Festival, the Association of American Dance Companies and the National Association for Regional Ballet, and contributed articles to Vogue, Parents Magazine and other publications. In recent years, she lectured and wrote about Catherine de' Medici, the Renaissance monarch who influenced the development of ballet in European courts.         In addition to her husband, Miss Joel is survived by a son, Eric Miller of Manhattan, and three brothers, Irving Tarnower of Teaneck, N.J., Dr. William Tarnower of Topeka, Kans., and Gerald Tarnower of Dallas.       
         Theodora Wiesner, the former director of the American Dance Festival and of the dance division of Brooklyn College, died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 83 years old.         She died of cancer, said her brother, Alwin, of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.         Dr. Wiesner, who was born in Rice Lake, Wis., was a physical-education major at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when she discovered the university's dance program. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 1930, she did graduate work in dance and physical education at New York University.         Dr. Wiesner taught dance before World War II at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago. She served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy Women's Reserve during the war and was director of emplacement for the Waves in San Diego.         In 1949, she became an administrative assistant at the Connecticut College School of Dance in New London, which presented the American Dance Festival, this country's leading summer festival of modern dance.         Dr. Wiesner was also director of the dance program at Brooklyn College from 1950 to 1975, when she retired.         Her brother is her only survivor.       
         Dr. Mary Ann Spencer Pulaski, a retired children's psychologist, lecturer and author, died on Saturday at Glen Cove Hospital on Long Island. She was 75 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         Her family said she died after a long illness.         Dr. Pulaski graduated from Wellesley College in 1938 and earned a Ph.D. in child psychology at City University of New York three decades later. In between, she worked in merchandising and advertising and as an editorial assistant at Glamour magazine.         While her children were in school, she earned master's degrees in education and school psychology and taught at the Buckley Country Day School in Roslyn, L.I. From 1967 until her retirement in 1979, she served as a psychologist in the Herricks public school system in New Hyde Park, L.I.         Dr. Pulaski was the author of many articles, including "Understanding Piaget." A revised edition of it was published by Harper & Row Publishers Inc. in 1980. She lectured widely and taught at Hofstra University, Adelphi University and Queens College of the City University of New York.         Dr. Pulaski is survived by her husband of 52 years, Charles A. Pulaski; a son, Charles A. Jr., of Tempe, Ariz.; a daughter, Elizabeth Mertens of Glen Head, L.I., and three grandchildren.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.       
         Dr. June Louin-Tapp, a professor at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development, died last Thursday in Osnabruck, Germany, while there for a two-month stay as a visiting professor at the University of Osnabruck. Dr. Louin-Tapp, a resident of Minneapolis, was 62 years old.         She died suddenly after a brief illness, said Richard Weinberg, director of the institute.         She taught and did research at the University of Chicago from 1964 to 1972, when she joined the Minnesota faculty. Her principal work concerned children's and adults' understanding of rules and laws.         She is survived by two daughters, Mara Tapp of Chicago and Kami Olsson-Tapp of San Diego, and four grandchildren.

         Grace T. Hamilton, a pioneer in racial integration who worked to give blacks a political voice in Atlanta, died on Wednesday at the Briarcliff Haven Nursing Home in Atlanta. She was 85 years old and lived in Atlanta.         Mrs. Hamilton was in the forefront of efforts to improve the lives of blacks and the poor through jobs, education, housing, health care and child care.         She was known for her diplomacy. Julian Bond, the former State Senator in Georgia, called her "a real pathfinder."         She was the first black woman elected to the Georgia Legislature, where she served in the General Assembly from 1966 to 1984.         As a legislator, Mrs. Hamilton was instrumental in expanding black representation in Atlanta's City Council. She drafted a law that authorized a revision of the city charter, then served as the charter commission's vice chairwoman. In 1973 the charter amended the citywide Council elections by adding 12 district seats, enabling heavily black areas to elect black candidates.         Earlier, Mrs. Hamilton headed the local Urban League for 18 years, starting in 1943, when blacks were largely excluded from power. Democratic candidates were virtually guaranteed of winning general elections, but only whites were allowed to vote in the party's primaries.         Mrs. Hamilton also promoted voter registration and fought for more aid to black schools, and she worked to end segregation across the South as the associate director of the Southern Regional Council and as a leader in the Highlander Folk School, a training institute.         She was a trustee of Clark Atlanta University and Meharry Medical College and served on the boards of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority and the National Young Women's Christian Association.         Mrs. Hamilton was born in Atlanta. Her father, George Towns, was a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She graduated there in 1927 and received a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University in 1929.         In 1930 she married Henry C. Hamilton, a dean at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis. She taught there and also worked on a Federal survey of black workers and on a college integration program. She returned to Atlanta in 1943 when her husband joined Morehouse College. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Payne of Atlanta; a sister, Harriet Jenkins of Shaker Heights, Ohio; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Sister Margaret Carthy, former president of the College of New Rochelle and dean of its graduate school, died on Sunday at the Marian Residence in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She was known as Mother Mary Peter during her long career as a Roman Catholic college administrator.         She had Alzheimer's disease and died of pneumonia, said Sister Eileen Fane, prioress of the Convent of St. Teresa, an Ursuline community in New Rochelle.         Sister Margaret was born and raised in Manhattan and graduated from the College of New Rochelle in 1933. She worked for several years in the business office at Teachers College at Columbia University but, after taking her vows in the Order of St. Ursuline in 1939, she returned to New Rochelle to teach at the Ursuline School. A Former Dean         Sister Margaret began her years in the administration at the College of New Rochelle as assistant registrar in 1941 and served as dean of the college from 1950 to 1957 and then as president until 1961. She earned a master's and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in American church history at Catholic University in Washington.         She added a master's degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and worked for four years as staff editor of The New Catholic Encyclopedia while also lecturing at Catholic University. She then taught at the University of Maryland, becoming assistant director of the general ecducation program and then assistant dean of graduate studies.         In 1975, she returned to her alma mater to accept the post of dean of the graduate school, which she held until her retirement in 1979.         Both before and after her retirement, Sister Margaret wrote articles and books about American church history, including "Catholicism in English-Speaking Lands" (Hawthorn Books, 1964). Much of her writing focused on the Archdiocese of New York, including "A Cathedral of Suitable Magnificence" (St. Patrick's, 1984). In addition, she served as archivist for the Eastern Province of the Ursulines.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Connolly of Jericho, L.I., and many nieces and nephews.       
         Helen Olheim, a mezzo-soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera, died on Friday at the Beneva Nursing Pavilion in Sarasota, Fla. She was 87 years old.         She died of natural causes, said her sister, Dorothy Dry of Berwick, Pa.         Miss Olheim, whose name was Oelheim off the stage, was a member of the Metropolitan Opera from 1935 to 1944. Among her roles were Mercedes in "Carmen" and Siebel in "Faust."         Miss Olheim was born in Buffalo and studied at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She sang with the American Opera Company and was a member of the Community Concert Series, which presented concerts around New York City. She also appeared in recital around the United States and in Europe, and was a guest on many radio programs.         After retiring from the Met, she taught for 10 years at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts before moving to Sarasota.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by a brother, Bennett C. Oelheim of Pacific Grove, Calif.       
         Rebecca C. Simonson, a New York City schoolteacher active in school affairs in the 1940's and 1950's, died on Sunday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Peekskill, N.Y.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her son, David C. Simonson.         Mrs. Simonson, a native of Brooklyn and a graduate of the Columbia University teacher training program, taught sixth grade at Public School 61 in the Bronx for most of her 35-year teaching career. From 1940 to 1952, she was president of the Teachers Guild, which preceded the United Federation of Teachers.         Her husband, Simon, died in 1943.         She is survived by her son, David, of Arlington, Va.; a brother, Sidney, of Norwalk, Conn.; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Carole Mills Weinberg, a modeling agent and executive, died on Thursday in Little Rock, Ark. She was 49 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.         She was in Little Rock for treatment for cancer at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences Center, her husband said.         Mrs. Weinberg was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and moved to the United States with her family. After attending Northwestern University, she began modeling in Chicago and then taught modeling there.         Moving to New York City in the 1960's, she worked as an agent for the Sanford Leigh modeling agency, then became director of the television division of the Ford modeling agency and later director of the casting department at the Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn advertising company. She specialized in television commercials.         She and her husband, William P. Weinberg, became half-owners of Wilhelmina International Limited, the parent company of the Wilhelmina Artists and Wilhelmina Models. He was president of the Wilhelmina organizations, and she was on the board of directors. They sold their share in the company two years ago but remained as consultants for special projects.         Her survivors include her husband and her parents, Adam and Greta Boyce of Mount Prospect, Ill.       
         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Lillian Vorhaus Oppenheimer, who made origami, the intricate Japanese art of paper-folding, popular in the United States, died on Friday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a heart operation, her family said.         Mrs. Oppenheimer started doing origami in 1930 to entertain her daughter Molly, who was suffering from meningitis, and quietly continued it as a hobby.         That suddenly changed when a burst of publicity starting in 1958 featured her in newspapers and on national radio and television. Mail and calls poured in from experts and novices alike.         So she founded the Origami Center of America in her Gramercy Park penthouse and spawned other branches, saying, "Why should the Japanese have all the fun?" Today, about 30 countries have origami societies -- her daughter Rosaly co-founded those in England and Israel -- with annual conventions. The Magic of Paper         Mrs. Oppenheimer taught origami to kindergartners, scout troops, Yale students, corporate executives and nursing home residents.         "She saw magic in a piece of paper," the Friends of the Origami Center said. Meyer Berger wrote in The New York Times in 1958: "Jewels form under her fingers."         As the art's popularity spread, the American Museum of Natural History began decorating its Christmas tree with origami in 1972, starting a collection that grew to 5,000 adornments. Origami even proved useful to therapists. One handicapped teen-ager's first words -- "I made it" -- were uttered upon completing an origami object.         Origami, with ancient roots in China, entails folding paper into two- or three-dimensional objects in varied geometric, abstract, fantasy and real-life forms, from geodesic balls to umbrellas to dragons to ducks. Experts can do a simple piece in less than a minute; elaborate ones take hours.         Mrs. Oppenheimer was also a noted puppeteer, giving presentations into her late 80's, and was also active in the Storytelling Center of New York. Sometimes she combined all three interests, using origami puppets to tell stories. She wrote books on origami and puppets, including three with the puppeteer Shari Lewis.         Mrs. Oppenheimer was married to Joseph B. Kruskal and later to Harry C. Oppenheimer, both now deceased.         She is survived by three sons by Mr. Kruskal, William H. of Chicago, Martin David of Princeton, N.J., and Joseph Jr. of Maplewood, N.J., and a daughter, Rosaly Evnine of Jerusalem; four stepsons by Mr. Oppenheimer, Peter, of Walnut Creek, Calif., Jack, of Sonoma, Calif., Philip, of South Norwalk, Conn., and Herbert, of Manhattan; 26 grandchildren, and 30 great-grandchildren.       
         Alberta Smith Jacoby, a film maker and lecturer on mental health, died on Wednesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Guilford, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Jacoby, a specialist in mental-health education, had been a member of the faculty of Yale University for the last 25 years and remained a lecturer on public health at the time of her death. She taught and produced documentaries at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, a part of the Yale School of Medicine.         She was born in Worthington, Minn., was an alternate on the 1928 Olympic diving team and became a champion golfer. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota and received a master's degree in public health from Yale in 1967, the year she joined the faculty.         She began to show films on health during World War II as a program director for the Office of War Information, an information officer at the Public Health Service and, finally, chief of information for the National Institute of Mental Health.         She went into film making herself in 1949, when she and her director-husband, the late Irving A. Jacoby, formed the Mental Health Film Board. A production company, it made more than 100 documentaries, some of which won awards, on subjects such as psychiatric illnesses, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and hospice care.         At Yale, she taught a course entitled Health Communications. With her assistance, student crews made films about local health agencies to educate the public about what the agencies did.         Mr. Jacoby died in 1985. She is survived by six children, Clair Haycraft Johnson of Maui, Hawaii, Sara Haycraft Sparrow of North Branford, Conn., Peter Altman of Boston, Leslie Altman Rescoria of Havertown, Pa., Tamar Jacoby of Manhattan, and Oren Jacoby, also of Manhattan; three brothers, Paul Smith of St. David's Island, Bermuda, and Robert and Sidney Smith, both of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Barbara Miller Solomon, a Harvard educator and leader in women's studies, died Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 73 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Dr. Solomon, a historian, taught Harvard's first course on the history of American women, the forerunner of what evolved into a broader women's studies program.         She also directed a major collection of historical material on women, served as Harvard's first female assistant dean and was a mentor to other female scholars.         Her book "In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America" (Yale University Press, 1985) won the Frederick W. Ness book award. The text traced the struggle of American women to gain access to college and assessed the importance of their education to them and to society in opening up new careers and roles. Family and Studies         Dr. Solomon, a native of Boston, graduated from Radcliffe in 1940, continued her studies there part time while starting a family and earned a doctorate in American civilization in 1953.         She first gained attention by turning her doctoral thesis on immigration into a book, "Ancestors & Immigrants: A Changing New England Tradition" (Harvard University Press, 1956). It is widely used as a college text and was honored by the National Conference of Christians and Jews.         Dr. Solomon started her teaching career at Wheelock College in Boston in 1957 and joined Harvard's faculty in 1959.         That year she became the director of the Women's Archives at Radcliffe, now known as the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America. Her work won national recognition when Lady Bird Johnson invited her to be guest of honor at the White House.         She also served as a college administrator, first as an associate dean at Harvard's affiliated Radcliffe College from 1963 to 1970, then as an assistant dean at Harvard from 1970 to 1974. After retiring from teaching in 1985, she was a scholar in residence at the Schlesinger Library.         Her husband of 48 years, Peter H. Solomon, a shoe company executive, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Peter Solomon of Toronto and Daniel Solomon of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Maida Solomon of Cambridge, and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, the director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, died on Sept. 3 at the institute, where she lived. She was 63 years old.         She died in her sleep, apparently of natural causes, the institute said.         Sister Scaglione had worked as an educator since joining the Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order, in 1947.         The order operates Grace Institute, which was founded by William Russell Grace and is now headed by his grandson, J. Peter Grace, the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company.         The institute provides free occupational training, mostly for secretarial work, and other adult education, including nutrition, cooking and clothing classes, for women. It enrolls about 1,000 students a year.         As the director, Sister Scaglione helped adapt the institute's program to the changing needs of the city's minority and immigrant women. She introduced new courses, including English as second language, and added night sessions and classes in the Bronx.         Before working at Grace, Sister Joseph taught at St. Raymond's Academy and Spellman High School in the Bronx and was the director of St. Joseph's Academy in Greenwich Village.         A native of New Jersey, she grew up in Manhattan and Queens. After graduating from the College of Mount St. Vincent, she earned a master's degree in business education from the College of St. Rose.         Surviving are a brother and sister, Jack and Rosalie Scaglione, both of Queens.         Correction:  September 26, 1992, Saturday         An obituary on Sept. 12 on Sister Joseph Maria Scaglione, director of the Grace Institute in Manhattan, misidentified her Roman Catholic order. The order, which runs the institute, is the Sisters of Charity, not the Sisters of Mercy.       
         Judith N. Shklar, a professor of government at Harvard University, died Wednesday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 63 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of a heart attack, said Ariadne Valsamis, a Harvard University spokeswoman.         Professor Shklar specialized in 18th, 19th, and 20th century political and intellectual theory. From 1989 to 1990 she was president of the American Political Science Association, the first woman to head the nation's largest professional organization of political scientists.         In 1984 she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for exceptionally talented individuals.         In 1985 she was awarded the teaching prize of the Harvard University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Its citation described her as "demanding, rewarding, forthright, fair, and reasonable, a model of intellectual and human qualities rarely combined."         Born in Riga, Latvia, Professor Shklar emigrated with her family first to Sweden and then in 1941 to Canada. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from McGill University and a doctorate in 1955 from Radcliffe College. She taught at Harvard since 1956.         Professor Shklar is survived by her husband, Gerald Shklar, a professor at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine; two sons, David, of Cambridge, and Michael, of Leminister, N.H., and a daughter, Ruth, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Saundra D. Shepherd, a pediatrician and educator who campaigned for medical care for needy children in New York City and in Africa, died on Thursday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of chronic pulmonary disease, a family spokesman said.         For the last eight years Dr. Shepherd was the director of social pediatric training at the Montefiore Medical Center. Since the early 1980's she taught there and at City College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She also had a private practice.         The harm to children's health from poverty, discrimination and the lack of housing was a major theme of her work. She was a frequent speaker in public and professional forums and testified before government bodies.         She was a consulting physician to the Legal Services Corporation and the Legal Aid Society for the last 16 years and worked with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Prisoners' Legal Services, the Newark Public Defender and the Rutgers Law School Homeless Rights Project.         Dr. Shepherd also served with the New York City Mayor's Advisory Council on Child Health, Physicians for Reproductive Health, the Teen-Age Adolescent Pregnancy Care and Prevention Program and the New York State Advisory Panel on Primary Physicians.         Her service in Africa included work on the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, a physicians' evaluation team in Liberia, the medical college planning committee for Africa University in Zimbabwe and the United Methodist Church medical aid program for Mozambique.         Dr. Shepherd was born in Manhattan. After graduating from City College in 1968, she earned a master's degree from Hunter College in 1971 and a medical degree from Yale in 1975. Early in her career she studied and did laboratory work in hematology.         Surviving are her husband of 19 years, Dr. Peter Finch; her parents, Sylvia Shepherd of Manhattan and Archibald Shepherd Jr. of Florida; a daughter, Abi Shepherd-Finch of Manhattan; a brother, Lawrence of Manhattan, and her grandmother, Doris Allman of Barbados.       
         Abigail Adams Eliot, a social worker who became a nationally known authority on early childhood education, died Thursday at the New England Deaconess Home, a nursing home in Concord, Mass. She had celebrated her 100th birthday on Oct. 9.         She died of a heart attack, said Jay Chrepta, a spokesman for Tufts University.         Dr. Eliot became active in the field after World War I, when the first few nursery schools with child study centers were set up in the United States.         After enrolling in the early 1920's at the Rachel MacMillan School and Training Center in London, one of the few schools that then trained nursery school teachers, Dr. Eliot returned to the United States, and she and Elizabeth W. Pearson, a Boston philanthropist, founded the Ruggles Street Nursery School in the Roxbury section of Boston. It taught children and also provided teacher-training in early childhood education.         In later years Dr. Eliot's institution evolved, becoming successively the Ruggles Street Nursery School and Training Center and the Nursery Training School of Boston. She was its director from 1922 until she retired in 1952.         That year, the institution was incorporated into Tufts, was moved to Medford, Mass., and was renamed the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University.         During the Depression, the Roosevelt Administration's Federal Emergency Relief Administration, with the cooperation of the United States Office of Education, organized what it called emergency nursery schools for needy children. Dr. Eliot, who was then secretary-treasurer of the National Association for Nursery Education, became a member of the National Advisory Committee for the program.         She was born in Boston, graduated from Radcliffe College in 1914 and was a social worker for several years. She received her doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1930.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Janice Gilbert Fulton, a bridge expert and game-show personality in the early days of television, was presumed dead after a boating accident last week near her home about 150 miles north of Haiti, her lawyer said yesterday.         The lawyer, Ian Miller, said that Mrs. Fulton's husband, David Fulton, 70 years old, a mining engineer, was also presumed dead, as was Dan Cooper, 45, a Canadian real estate developer who was a passenger when the Fultons' 22-foot fishing boat capsized in choppy waters on Thursday morning.         Mr. Miller said he notified the authorities when the Fultons failed to return to their home, on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.         He said rescuers found two survivors, Douglas Colledi of London, Ontario, and Lucien Vixama of Providenciales, in the Fultons' righted boat on Friday. A search of the Caribbean by private planes and the Coast Guard was called off on Sunday.         Family members said Mrs. Fulton was born in New York City about 1920. She played Little Orphan Annie on radio soap operas. Later she played the Paying Teller on the television give-away show "Break the Bank" in the 1950's.         In 1955 she married Tobias Stone of Las Vegas, Nev., a champion bridge player who taught her to play the game. They won the Goldman Pairs in 1957, making them the only married couple to win in the 64-year history of the event; they also won the Master Mixed Team Championship in 1965. She won three other national titles: the Women's Teams in 1956 and 1969 and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1965.         Mr. Stone and Mrs. Fulton divorced in 1975, and in 1980 she married Mr. Fulton, who had been the chief mining engineer in the Stone family gold and silver mining business, where she worked from 1974 to 1978.         Mrs. Fulton's first husband, William Miles, lives in Los Angeles. Her second husband, William Dunlop, is deceased. She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Miles of Los Angeles, and by a daughter, Leslie Coren of Hallandale, Fla.       
         Hadassah, a pioneer of Israeli and Indian dancing in America, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Milton Epstein.         Hadassah, who was born in Jerusalem and whose original name was Hadassah Spira, became interested in Indian dancing at an early age. She studied dance in the United States and abroad, learning a wide range of Indian styles along with Javanese court dance, Japanese dance and modern dance. Her teachers included Ram Gopal and Jack Cole.         Hadassah, a performer of special eloquence, made her professional debut in 1945 and continued to perform Indian, Israeli, Javanese and Balinese dance through the mid-1970's. She appeared at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., four times in the 1950's and 60's and toured India in 1959-60.         Among Hadassah's best-known works was "Shuvi Nafshi" ("Return, Oh My Soul"), based on Psalm 116. Her "Tagore Suite," commissioned by the Tagore Centenary Committee, was performed for the first time in 1961.         Hadassah was also a popular teacher, known for her great warmth, who taught Israeli and Indian dance across the United States and abroad. She was a faculty member, board member and chairwoman of the ethnic division at the New Dance Group Studio in Manhattan and continued teaching through the mid-1980's.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Harriet Silverstein of San Diego, and three brothers, Simon, also of San Diego, Israel, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Abraham, of Yardley, Pa.       
         Alice I. Bryan, a psychologist who fostered the advancement of women in her profession and who led a major study on the role of libraries, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of leukemia, her relatives said. Her death was reported yesterday by Columbia University, where she had taught for 35 years.         Dr. Bryan was a founder and president of the National Council of Women Psychologists. Its first meeting was held in her apartment. She was also an officer of the American Association for Applied Psychology and the American Psychology Association.         This year she addressed the American Library Association, which honored her on the 40th anniversary of her book "The Public Librarian." Based on interviews with more than 3,000 librarians, it explored the role of libraries as centers of mass communication.         Dr. Bryan started teaching part time at Sarah Lawrence College and Pratt Institute in the 1930's, and joined Columbia's Library School in 1939 as a psychologist and teacher. She became its first female full professor and helped organize its doctoral program. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Bryan, whose family name was Bever, was born in Kearny, N.J. Her marriages to Chester Bryan and Frank Blasingame ended in divorce. Her third husband, George V. Fuller, died in 1960.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Ilse Sass, a pianist and voice teacher, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old and lived in New York City         She died of a pulmonary embolism, said her sister, Leine Seligmann.         Miss Sass was born in Cologne, Germany, and studied at the music conservatory there. She taught piano for many years at the Henry Street Settlement and taught voice for 20 years at Juilliard and at the Manhattan School of Music.         She gave concerts for the blind and worked with blind singers. She also appeared as a piano teacher in the movie "Fame."         Her sister is her only survivor.       
         Hanya Holm, a major choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 99 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said Heidi Holm, her daughter-in-law.         To theatergoers, Miss Holm was known as the choreographer of musicals including Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Out of This World" and Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot." To modern-dance aficionados, Miss Holm was the most significant choreographer and dancer to have come out of the Central European Expressionist dance tradition in Germany. Its most noted figure was Mary Wigman, and Miss Holm was her student. Her 1937 "Trend," a dance of social protest, is considered a masterwork of American modern dance. Miss Holm has been considered a member of a pantheon of American modern-dance choreographers that included Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman.         A funny, humane and uncompromising woman, Miss Holm encouraged her pupils to find their own individual ways of artistic expression. Her students included leading choreographers as diverse as Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, Glen Tetley, Don Redlich and Lucinda Childs. Sound and Movement         Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes. She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915. The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman. Miss Holm was dancing with Wigman's troupe by 1921 and taught in her school in Dresden. She remained a leading Wigman teacher and dancer for 10 years, creating roles in "Feier" and "Totenmal," which she helped Wigman choreograph. It was during this time that she changed her name.         In 1930-31, Sol Hurok brought the Wigman company to the United States for a transcontinental tour. Hurok had urged Wigman to found an American school, and she agreed, sending Miss Holm to America to direct it. Miss Holm arrived in New York City in September 1931, and for the next five years she devoted herself to teaching. She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance. The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective." The distinction, she added, was "one of 'being' as contrasted with 'doing.' "         Miss Holm took on other teaching positions in important dance institutions, among them, in 1934, the Bennington College Summer School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival, where the "Trend" was first performed. In 1941, she developed the influential summer dance program at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, where she continued to teach until 1983. Part of the success of her teaching lay in her pithy instructions to students. "Keep the beat," she told them, "but undermine it." Another instruction was to "use the feet as if you would pick up a flower with your toes." Her students were familiar with the command to "feel it, children, don't schlep it." 'Living Essence'         She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching. "If I see one more leg extension, I've had it," Miss Holm said in 1984. "There is security in a major leg extension. But it means nothing. The simplest thing is to shun the emotions and emphasize technique. But you become like a nice stove that doesn't give any heat." One had to be careful, she noted, of trying to instill that "little bit of living essence." "You can't take something away without         giving         something," she said.         She had begun choreographing in 1928, but her American concert career began in 1937 with a tour of Midwestern colleges. She made her New York debut that year in a program that included "Trend," her first major work in America, which had a cast of 33 dancers, some of them from her own company and the rest students at Bennington. A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp. Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.         John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering." He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen."         One of the best descriptions of Miss Holm's dances and of "Trend" came, however, in an observation made by the choreographer about Wigman's work. "In her dances she alternately grapples with space as an opponent and caresses it as though it were a living, sentient thing," Miss Holm said. "In her gestures and movement she carves boldly and delicately visible and fluid forms, shaping, surrounding and sinking in the space which presses close about her." Early TV, Then Broadway         Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary. In 1939, she also became the first concert dancer to present her work on television in the United States, showing a shortened version of "Metropolitan Daily," a humorous depiction of a daily newspaper.         Miss Holm had abandoned modern dance for the Broadway stage by 1947, although she continued to create dances for her summer students and choreographed four well-received dances for the Don Redlich Dance Company in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's. Her first success was with the 1948 "Ballet Ballads," a suite of dances she created with Katherine Litz and Paul Godkin to music composed by Jerome Moross, with lyrics by John Latouche.         As a result of the success of her dance, "The Eccentricities of Davy Crockett," Miss Holm was invited to choreograph "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948 and won a New York Drama Critics Award. Over the next 18 years, she created dances for 13 musicals becoming known for her ability to meet the stylistic needs of each show. In 1952, she became the first choreographer to copyright a dance: her choreography for "Kiss Me, Kate," submitted as a written Labanotation score on microfilm.         Among Miss Holm's other Broadway musicals were "Out of This World," "My Darlin' Aida" and "The Golden Apple." She also created the dances for the London and Tel Aviv productions of "My Fair Lady." She choreographed and directed the opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe" in 1956 in Central City, Colo., and Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" for the second annual Vancouver International Festival in 1959. Among her film and television assignments were the dances for the 1955 film version of "The Vagabond King." Miss Holm was also known for her essays, published in periodicals and books, on dance teaching and technique.         Her honors included an award from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for her contributions to modern dance in 1958, the Capezio Award, the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award in 1984 and the Astaire Award in 1987. "It just happened," Miss Holm said of her career in accepting the Scripps Award, "and whatever has happened was with love, dedication, good will, gladly and well. I keep on doing it as good as I can and as long as I can."         Miss Holm's marriage to Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a painter and sculptor, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Klaus, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and three granddaughters, Karen Trautlein of Wilkes-Barre, Angela Holm of San Diego and Jessica Werbin of New Haven, Conn.       
         Allene Z. Roach, a journalist and teacher whose struggle with Alzheimer's disease was described in a 1985 book by one of her daughters, died on Friday at the Fairfield Division of the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 65 years old.         She died of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Marion Roach Smith. Mrs. Smith wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine and a book, both titled "Another Name for Madness" (Houghton Mifflin, 1985), about her mother's ordeal.         Mrs. Roach attended Northwestern University and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1950. She began her career as a reporter and society editor of The Long Island Star-Journal, a daily newspaper in Long Island City, Queens, that is defunct.         After earning a master's degree in education from the New School for Social Research in 1970, she taught at Escuela Hispana in Manhattan until her retirement in 1980.         She grew up in Douglaston Manor, Queens, and lived there until she moved into a nursing home eight years ago. Her husband, James P. Roach, who died in 1978, was the sports editor of The New York Times from 1958 to 1973.         In addition to Mrs. Smith, an author and freelance writer who lives in Petersburgh, N.Y., Mrs. Roach is survived by her daughter Margaret, the gardening editor of Newsday, who lives in Manhattan and Copake Falls, N.Y.       
         Norma K. Regan, a high school teacher and sculptor, died on Tuesday in a convalescent home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 95 years old and had been a longtime resident of Hartford.         She died of pneumonia, said a spokesman for the DellaVeccia Funeral Home in Southington, Conn.         A member of the Hartford public school system for many years, Miss Regan taught English at Weaver and Bulkeley high schools. She also coached students for college entrance examinations.         Inspired by Alexander Caldor, she studied sculpture while teaching. Her works were exhibited in group shows at the New Britain Museum of American Art, the New Haven Paint and Clay Club, the Yale Art Gallery, the Springfield Museum in Massachusetts and other galleries.         Miss Regan graduated from Cornell University in 1919. She was a member of the Cornell Club of Greater Hartford from 1959 to 1979, actively involved in regional programming, student recruitment and fund raising. She also belonged to the Advisory Council in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell and the University Council. She was honored by the university in 1981 as a "foremost benefactor."         Miss Regan sponsored a film, "Cornell Plantations" in 1974-75 and was special consultant for a film, "Mr. President," in 1977-78, on the university's president, Frank H. T. Rhodes.  Both films were shown on public television in Connecticut and elsewhere.         She is survived by a cousin, Normadiene W. England of Southington.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Rebecca Grand, a former teacher and assistant principal in New York City public schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Miss Grand fell last winter and grew progressively weaker afterward, said her lawyer, Hazel Schizer.         During a 35-year career from 1937 to 1972, Miss Grand was a history teacher, guidance department chairman and an assistant principal of Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn. Before that, she taught history and economics at Hunter College High School from 1929 to 1937. She retired in 1972.         Miss Grand, a native of Brooklyn, received a bachelor's degree at Hunter College in 1929 and a master's degree at Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1931.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Rebecca Ann Donovan, a sociologist and an associate professor at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 46 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said Robert Bazell, a friend.         Professor Donovan was the head of research at the Hunter College School of Social Work. She specialized in the study of the social consequences of economic change, such as the impact of job loss on individuals.         She was born in Peoria, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in 1968 and a doctorate from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1983. Before joining the Hunter faculty, she taught at New York University and Columbia, where she was research director of the school's Industrial Social Welfare Center.         She is survived by her companion, Susan Hajjar; her mother, Sarah Donovan of Winter Park, Fla., and a sister, Janette Harriott of Edmond, Okla.       
         Vivienne Segal, a musical-comedy star who appeared on Broadway in "The Desert Song," "No, No, Nanette," and "Pal Joey," died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 95 years old and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died of heart failure, said Robert Sidney, a friend.         Miss Segal was born in Philadelphia, where she studied voice. She made her operatic debut in 1915 singing the title role of "Carmen" at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. The next year she took the leading role in "The Blue Paradise" at the Casino Theater in New York City, a show with which she toured for two years. On returning to New York, she appeared in many reviews, musicals and operettas, including "The Little Whopper" and "The Yankee Princess." In 1924, she was featured in the "Ziegfeld Follies." As the 'Fair Young Girl'         The roles capitalized on her fresh-faced beauty and sweet voice. "Just because I was little and could sing and wasn't too bad to look at, I was called a prima donna and was cast repeatedly in operettas and musical comedies as the fair young girl who was good and noble and got what she deserved," Miss Segal complained to an interviewer in 1940.         If Miss Segal found her roles limiting, audiences in the 1920's and 30's doted on her in musical confections like "Florida Girl," "The Desert Song," "The Chocolate Soldier," "Music in the Air," "The Three Musketeers" and "No, No, Nanette."         Miss Segal made her film debut in 1927 in an early sound short, singing excerpts from "Sweethearts" and "Maytime." She also appeared in "Song of the West," "Golden Dawn," "Bride of the Regiment" and "Viennese Nights," all made in 1930, and in "The Cat and the Fiddle" (1934). She later told an interviewer that she went on strike to protest the saccharine roles she was given. A Change in Style         In 1938, the lyricist Lorenz Hart came to the rescue, offering her the role of a cynical countess in "I Married an Angel" on Broadway. "He was the only one who really got me out of a rut of playing sweet-faced ingenues and taught me how to play comedy," she told an interviewer in the early 1950's.         Two years later came her breakthrough role, as the hard-boiled Vera Simpson in "Pal Joey." Describing her show-stopping number, "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, "In a singularly sweet voice she sings some scabrous lyrics by Lorenz Hart to one of Richard Rodgers' most haunting tunes."         After appearing in the Richard Rodgers revival of "A Connecticut Yankee" (1943) and in "Great to Be Alive!" (1950), she did a reprise of her role in "Pal Joey" in 1952, for which she was named best actress in a musical by the New York Drama Critics.         On television she appeared in "Studio One" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         Her first marriage, to Robert D. Ames, an actor, ended in divorce. In 1950, she married Hubbell Robinson Jr., a vice president of CBS. He died in 1974.         She is survived by a sister, Louise Paget Kowalski of Los Angeles.
