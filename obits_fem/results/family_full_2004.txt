         Vestal Goodman, a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience, died on Saturday in Celebration, Fla. She was 74.         The Associated Press reported her death based on information from funeral home officials and her own Web site. The cause was not given.         Mrs. Goodman and her husband, Howard Goodman, known as Happy, who died last year at 81, were cofounders of the Happy Goodman Family act. Friends said Mrs. Goodman never really recovered from her husband's death.         The Happy Goodman Family, whose enthusiastic and inspirational live performances recalled early camp-meeting evangelism, formed in 1949 and was on the road constantly for 50 years. They often appeared as part of Billy Graham Crusades.         The Happy Goodman Family recorded 15 No. 1 gospel hits and played more than 3,500 concerts. The family was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998.         Mrs. Goodman, who dreamed of being an opera star as a girl, brought operatic flourishes to gospel. She never forsook her signature beehive hairstyle, her floor-length beaded gowns or the white handkerchief she carried in her right hand. Fans often waved their own handkerchiefs back.         The family's music revived in popularity in the 1990's, taking its place beside the younger contemporary Christian musicians and groups.         In the 1980's, the Goodmans were featured on the ''PTL Club'' television show of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. They left the program in 1988, and were not linked to scandals involving the Bakkers.         The Happy Goodman Family also often featured Happy's brothers Rusty and Sam.         They were an inspiration to the current gospel great Bill Gaither, who included the Goodmans in more than 60 of his Gaither Homecoming videos, a popular series that was a precursor of music videos. Mrs. Goodman was featured on the current Gaither Homecoming tour and had been booked to continue with the tour into 2004. Her autobiography, ''Vestal!,'' was published in 1998.         The troubled country star George Jones told The Tennessean newspaper in 2002 that after he was nearly killed a few years ago in a drunk-driving accident north of Nashville, he sent for Mrs. Goodman, who came to pray with him in the hospital and became a spiritual mentor.         Mrs. Goodman is survived by a son, Rick; a daughter, Vicki; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Kiharu Nakamura, a geisha in Tokyo in the 1930's who wrote a popular memoir and taught sopranos how to portray the most famous geisha in fiction, Madama Butterfly, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Jackson Heights, Queens. She was 90.         The report of her death came from Artemis Willis, who is making a documentary film about her.         Miss Nakamura, whose original name was Kazuko Yamamoto, was born on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Her family moved to Tokyo when she was a child, and at age 15 she joined the Shimbashi Geisha Association. She learned to play the three-stringed lute called the shamisen, to sing ballads in the traditional quavering voice, to dance and otherwise entertain. She adopted the name Kiharu, which means happy spring.         She also learned English, an accomplishment that led to the end of her career as a geisha. Pressed by the military police to report on her foreign clients, she instead married a young diplomat, Shintaro Ota, and moved with him to his post in Calcutta.         They returned to Japan during the war and later divorced, and she eventually married a photographer, Masaya Nakamura. After a second divorce, she moved to New York, where she became a sought-after expert on geisha traditions.         Ms. Nakamura helped the soprano Anna Moffo and many other singers prepare for the role of Cio-Cio-San in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' teaching them how to walk with their feet together, hold a fan and stand up gracefully from kneeling.         She was also a consultant on the Broadway show ''M. Butterfly,'' and was cited in the acknowledgments of Arthur Golden's 1997 novel ''Memoirs of a Geisha.''         Her own memoir, ''An Edokko Geisha'' (1983), was a best seller in Japan and became a mini-series on Japanese television. She also wrote two other memoirs, as well as autobiographical novels. Her books have not been translated into English.         Miss Nakamura is survived by her companion, Robert E. Lee of Jackson Heights; a son, Masakatsu Ota of Niigata, Japan; and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist and self-help author whose books touched on identity, resolving stress and the grief occasioned by the World Trade Center attacks, died on Jan. 10 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. She was 55.         The cause was respiratory failure after pneumonia, said her husband, Steven Fink.         One of her books, ''The Type E Woman,'' published in 1986, described the stresses of balancing a career and family. Dr. Braiker's literary agent, Alice Martel, said the ''E'' represented the woman who tried to be ''everything to everybody.'' The book was a response to research into the Type A personality so often associated with hard-driving men. It was Dr. Braiker's favorite through the years, Mr. Fink said.         In another book, ''The Disease to Please,'' she described a destructive propensity that drives people, usually women, to serve others to the detriment of their own well-being.         In the introduction to ''The September 11 Syndrome,'' published four months after the 2001 attacks, she described the premise of the book as helping readers turn ''our collective emotional adversity'' into their own psychological victories. The book prescribed steps to control feelings of helplessness and anxiety awakened by terrorism.         Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who met Dr. Braiker in graduate school, said she ''brought an extremely strong theoretical background to popular writing.''         ''Her books took problems that were common and subliminal and put them out in the open,'' Dr. Jamison said.         Harriet Beryl Braiker was born in Los Angeles. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and won a National Science Foundation research scholarship. In 1975, she received a doctorate in clinical and social psychology from U.C.L.A.         Before establishing a private practice in 1980, Dr. Braiker worked at the RAND Corporation, analyzing health policies for the federal government. She later became a contributing editor for Working Woman and a columnist for Lear's magazine. She also appeared on television and radio talk shows and was an expert witness in legal cases on sexual harassment.         Although her earliest works examined alcoholism, depression and destructive relationships, her most recent book, ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?'' (2003), was a study of manipulation.         In addition to her husband, surviving are their daughter, Amanda Fink, also of Pasadena; a stepson, Stuart, of New York; and a brother, Dr. Barry Braiker of Beverly Hills, Calif.       
         Beatrice Winde, a character actress of stage, film and television, died on Jan. 3 at her home on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, two days short of her 80th birthday.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Winde received a Tony nomination for her Broadway debut in 1972, and won an Audelco Award for Excellence in Black Theater three years ago.         Her nomination for best supporting actress in a musical, in Melvin Van Peebles's ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' was the first of seven she received.         The Audelco Award for best supporting actress was given for her portrayal of the godmother in ''A Lesson Before Dying,'' staged by the Signature Theater Company.         In 1997, she received a Living Legend Award from the National Black Theater.         Ms. Winde's film career also dated to the 1970's, when she appeared in ''The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman'' on television and in the film ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,'' both in 1974.         She later had roles in more than two dozen films and made guest appearances in popular television series like ''Law and Order,'' ''The Sopranos,'' and ''N.Y.P.D. Blue.''         Ms. Winde acted in plays by Toni Morrison and Horton Foote and in productions by the Negro Ensemble Company, the Manhattan Theater Club, the Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater and Playwrights Horizons, among others.         Ms. Winde, whose original name was Beatrice Lucille Williams, was born in Chicago on Jan. 25, 1924. She was a voice student at the Chicago Music Conservatory, from which she graduated, and continued her voice studies briefly at the Yale University School of Music and at Juilliard.         She sang in Chicago with a group, and as a soloist in a church choir before settling on a career as an actor. She took the name Beatrice Winde because Actors Equity already had a Beatrice Williams on its rolls.         Ms. Winde's marriage to Raymond Stough, a fellow actor, ended in divorce. She is survived by two brothers, George C. Williams of Tucson, Ariz., and John W. Williams of Chicago.         Correction:  January 27, 2004, Tuesday  Because of editing errors, an obituary of the Broadway and film actress Beatrice Winde on Sunday misstated the dates of her birth and death and her Tony nomination record. She was born on Jan. 5, 1924, and died on Jan. 3. She was nominated once, in 1972, as best supporting actress in a musical, for her role in ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death.'' (It was the show itself that received seven nominations.)       
         Fanny Blankers-Koen, a Dutch housewife who emulated her hero, Jesse Owens, and won four gold medals in track and field in one Olympics -- the only woman to do so -- died yesterday in Amsterdam. She was 85.         The International Association of Athletics Federations, which oversees track and field, announced her death on its Web site. Her daughter, Fanny, said she had had serious heart problems over the past several years, Reuters reported, and the track and field federation said she also had Alzheimer's disease.         In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, 18-year-old Francina Elsje Koen (pronounced COON) finished fifth in the women's 4x100-meter relay and sixth in the high jump. Her most memorable moment came, however, when she got the autograph of Owens, the American sprinter who won four gold medals.         The 1940 and 1944 Olympics were canceled because of World War II. In 1940, Koen married her coach, Jan Blankers, 12 years her senior, and by the time the 1948 London Olympics arrived, they were raising a son, Jan, and a daughter, Fanny.         Blankers-Koen held or shared six world records -- in the 100-meter dash, 80-meter hurdles, high jump, long jump, 4x100 relay and 4x400 relay -- but she was 30 years old. No woman in Olympic track that year was older.         At the time, elite track and field was still an amateur sport. She trained only two hours a day, twice a week, and in the winter only on Saturday afternoons. She pedaled to practice with her two children in a bicycle basket behind her. They would build sand castles in the dirt high-jump pit while she worked out.         Her track career upset people.         ''I got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with -- how do you say it? -- short trousers,'' she said in The New York Times in 1982. ''But I was a good mother. I had no time for much besides my house chores and training, and when I went shopping it was only to buy food for the family and never to buy dresses.         ''One newspaperman wrote that I was too old to run, that I should stay at home and take care of my children. When I got to London, I pointed my finger at him and I said, 'I show you.' ''         She did. In the 1948 London Olympics, the 5-foot-9, 140-pound Blankers-Koen won four of the nine track and field events for women. First came the 100 meters in 11.9 seconds. Then the 80-meter hurdles in 11.2 seconds, an Olympic record, though she had to survive a three-way photo finish and a huge scare.         For many minutes, the judges examined the finish photo. When the band struck up ''God Save the King,'' she thought it meant that an English rival had won. Instead, the music marked the arrival of King George VI, and moments later Blankers-Koen learned that she had won.         Next came the 200 meters and more painful moments. Before the semifinals, she told her husband she was nervous and wanted to quit the Olympics because of the pressure. ''Two Olympic medals is enough,'' she said.         Years later, her husband remembered in The Times: ''I had to talk much. There is only one chance in your life that you can perhaps win three gold medals, and that's the chance that you will take.''         She cried, then won the 200 final by 7 yards, the widest margin ever in an Olympics, in 24.4 seconds. Then, in the 4x100-meter relay, she took the baton for the anchor leg in fourth place, 5 yards behind the leader, and won a photo finish in 47.5 seconds.         In seven days, she ran 11 races and won them all. When she returned to Amsterdam, she was driven through crowded streets in an open carriage drawn by four white horses. The celebration almost equaled the one held when the city was liberated from German occupation.         Queen Juliana made her a knight in the Order of Orange Nassau. Neighbors gave her a bicycle so she wouldn't have to run so much.         ''I didn't know the Dutch people were so interested in track,'' she said in The Times. ''They never came to any of our meets.''         She was born on a 62-acre farm outside the Dutch village of Baarn, the only daughter of a well-off father who became a government inspector. When she started track at age 15, she was already a good swimmer. The pool director soon told her she had to choose one sport. She chose track, and by 17 she had broken her first national record.         Blankers-Koen kept running after the 1948 Olympics. She won three gold medals in the 1950 European championships and, despite painful boils on a leg, she ran the 80-meter hurdles in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. She became dizzy from medication, tripped on a hurdle and dropped out of the race.         In 1955, she retired from track but kept in shape with running, swimming, cycling and tennis. Her husband died in 1977.         She remained a national hero. When she was 64, her son said in The Times: ''I remember when I was growing up, there were always so many people greeting my mother on the street that I was embarrassed. I'd walk five paces behind her. I don't have that feeling anymore, but I still walk five paces behind her. That's because she walks so fast. Mother still goes everywhere in a hurry.''       
         Uta Hagen, the formidable and wide-ranging stage actress who electrified audiences with her Tony Award-winning performance as the ferocious, tart-tongued Martha in the original Broadway production of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1962, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter, Leticia Ferrer, said. She was 84.         Over seven decades, Ms. Hagen acted in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Shaw, as well as in plays by Mr. Albee and Tennessee Williams. With her husband Herbert Berghof (who died in 1990), she ran the HB Studios in Manhattan and was celebrated not only as an actress but also as a teacher of acting and author of books on the subject. She continued to teach after a stroke and until several months before her death. Occasionally she appeared in films and on television, but principally her life was onstage, and it was there that she was able to incarnate the widest diversity of characters.         Ms. Hagen made her professional debut in 1937 playing Ophelia to Eva Le Gallienne's Hamlet, and was acclaimed for her Nina (in ''The Seagull''), Desdemona (opposite Paul Robeson's Othello), Shaw's St. Joan, Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and as the title character in ''The Country Girl'' by Clifford Odets. Mr. Albee's Martha became her signature role.         It was a long journey from Ophelia to Martha, but one that she traveled with an unmatchable authority and an intuitive sense of character. Whether she was playing a saint or a termagant, she anchored each role with a firm base in reality. Despite her onstage strength, she said she always considered herself ''a vulnerable actress.'' Once asked what qualities an actress needed to play Martha, Ms. Hagen said, ''Intelligence, voluptuousness and hypersensitivity,'' and then added, ''wit'' -- all of which she had in abundance.         In a recent interview, Mr. Albee recalled her ''extraordinary performances as Desdemona in 'Othello' and Martha in 'Virginia Woolf,' '' and praised Ms. Hagen first as ''a profoundly truthful actress'' and then as ''a dedicated and demanding teacher.''         ''I should add,'' he said, ''she was a great anti-hypocrite, and a superb cook -- not a bad friend to have.''         In 1999, she called her whole goal as an actress ''the spontaneity that comes without planning.'' Whenever possible, she uncovered the drama behind the comedy -- or the comedy behind the drama. As she said, ''Somebody with wit and a sense of humor sees the most tragic event without the sentimentality, sees in any life experience something ludicrous -- which is probably why Chekhov is my favorite.''         She believed a performance should change in the course of the run, depending on the identity of the other actors, the audience response and the actress's mood and temperament. She played Blanche opposite Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn (her favorite), Ralph Meeker, Richard Kiley and Jack Palance. ''If you go on with another actor and your performance doesn't change, you're a bad actor.''         In contrast to many other actors, she loved long runs: ''After a couple of months,'' she said, ''it really starts to get in my bones.'' On keeping a part alive, she called Laurette Taylor her guide. She saw her play Amanda in ''The Glass Menagerie'' 10 times, saying, ''Ten different exciting performances -- to me, that is the magic of the theater.''         Uta Hagen was born in Göttingen, Germany, on June 12, 1919. Her father named her after a 13th-century statue he saw in a Nuremburg cathedral. When Uta was 7, the family moved to Madison, Wis., where her father was head of the department of art history at the University of Wisconsin (her mother was an opera singer). From the age of 6, when she saw Elisabeth Bergner play Shaw's ''St. Joan'' in Berlin, she wanted to be an actress. She studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and at the University of Wisconsin, and left college -- and left home -- to pursue an acting career.         In 1937, Le Gallienne was preparing to play Hamlet in a production in Dennis, Mass., and was having difficulty finding an Ophelia. Ms. Hagen sent a letter requesting an audition. As Le Gallienne recalled in her autobiography, her impulse was to refuse, but something in the letter encouraged her to invite the young actress to audition.         ''She was very young -- only just 17 -- a tall, rather gawky creature, by no means pretty, but with a face that one remembered,'' Le Gallienne wrote, adding she had ''the shy ungainly grace of a young colt.'' For her audition, Ms. Hagen acted the end of the trial scene from ''St. Joan,'' ''quite badly,'' Le Gallienne said, ''and yet I sensed in her an inner truth that very occasionally filtered through in a word or a look.'' She told her to go and think about the role and return in an hour.         ''The improvement was startling,'' Le Gallienne said, ''The truth that had glimmered so faintly in the first reading now blazed up strongly, and the overall effect was strangely moving.'' She cast her.         In the dress rehearsal, she said, ''the sacred fire struck, and the child Uta was transported to a region which I well knew she would not set foot in again for many years to come.'' And so, just 18, Ms. Hagen made her professional debut as Ophelia, an Ophelia that was several inches taller than Hamlet.         She then joined Le Gallienne's theater company, which was preparing a production of ''The Seagull.'' The director was playing the role of Nina, with Ms. Hagen as her understudy. That production never came to fruition, but soon Ms. Hagen heard that Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were about to do it on Broadway.         At the audition, Lunt told her to do something simple, not classical and nothing from ''The Seagull.'' She had planned to do the last scene from ''A Doll's House,'' but at the last minute decided to do Nina anyway. ''I played the whole last scene as Nina alone, without a Konstantin present,'' she recalled, ''and I came offstage in a daze.'' As she headed out the stage door, she was called back, and Lunt (who was playing Trigorin) rehearsed with her long into the night, and then told her she had the part. Ms. Hagen's Broadway debut came the next year as Nina in Lunt and Fontanne's ''Seagull.'' In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson singled her out for praise as ''grace and aspiration incarnate.''         That summer, working in Ridgefield, Conn., she acted in ''The Latitude of Love,'' opposite José Ferrer. In the course of the play, she was required to knock him down. Several months later they were married. During their 10-year marriage, they appeared together in several plays, including ''Angel Street.''         Ms. Hagen is survived by their daughter, Leticia, known as Lettie, of New York City; a granddaughter; and a great-granddaughter.         Ms. Hagen said she considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as ''the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater.'' During that time, she acted in seven Broadway plays, including ''Key Largo'' (with Paul Muni) and ''Othello'' (with Robeson as Othello and Ferrer as Iago). The turning point, she said, was in 1947 when Harold Clurman directed her in ''The Whole World Over.'' The play was forgettable, but she greatly admired Clurman as a director and teacher, and it was in that play that she met Berghof, who replaced another actor in the company.         Having divorced Ferrer, she married Berghof and the two dedicated themselves to teaching actors in their HB Studio, on Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In subsequent years, teaching young actors became as important to her as her own acting. In one of her books, ''A Challenge for the Actor,'' she disagreed with Shaw's pronouncement ''He who can does. He who cannot teaches.'' For her, ''Only he who can should teach.''         In 1948, she led the national company of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and then followed Jessica Tandy in the role on Broadway. In 1950 she played the title role in ''The Country Girl.'' For that performance, she won her first Tony.         The next year, she finally played St. Joan, in Margaret Webster's production. Always outspoken about politics and human rights, Ms. Hagen was blacklisted in the 1950's, and, she said, ''that fact kept me pure.'' Unable to work in the movies or on television or to tour plays through the United States, she continued to focus her attentions on New York theater. She was a member of the Phoenix Theater, but her acting became more sporadic.         Then, in 1962, the call came to return to the stage. The producer Richard Barr and his partners were bringing a new play by a new playwright to Broadway, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, and they were searching for an actress to play the central role. Ms. Hagen read the play between classes and it so gripped her that she taught her final class, she said, ''in a daze.'' Immediately she agreed to do it, and when she met the playwright she told him the play was ''like a great modern Bosch canvas.''         In the play a faculty couple, George and Martha (Arthur Hill and Ms. Hagen) engage in a long night of mutual abuse -- and revelation. Ms. Hagen's performance galvanized the play. ''Virginia Woolf'' was a turning point for the actress and for Mr. Albee. The play received five Tonys, including awards for both Ms. Hagen and Mr. Hill. In 1964, they both did the play in London.         In the years that followed, Ms. Hagen occasionally ventured back into theater. In 1968, she played Mme. Ranevskaya in Le Gallienne's A.P.A. ''Cherry Orchard.'' Later she did Peter Hacks's ''Charlotte'' (in which she played Goethe's mistress), Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell'' and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' Nicholas Wright's ''Mrs. Klein'' and, in 1998, Donald Margulies's ''Collected Stories.''         After playing Martha on Broadway and London and making a recording with the original cast, she did not return to the role -- until 1999.         In a single performance for the benefit of the HB Playwrights Foundation, she played Martha once more in a staged reading on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce played George and Matthew Broderick and Mia Farrow were the couple's two guests.         At 80, she was aware of the pitfalls. ''It's a terrible risk for me,'' she said. ''I'm 28 years too old for the part. I was 42 when I played it. Martha's supposed to be 52. People have such incredible memories of my performance. I don't see how anybody could possibly live up to it, certainly not me, almost 40 years later.''         But once she came onstage, and said Martha's first line: ''Jesus H. Christ,'' followed by her imitation of Bette Davis saying ''What a dump,'' and as she pitched into verbal battle with her husband, the intervening years passed in a cloud.         Correction:  January 29, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the Broadway actress and drama teacher Uta Hagen on Jan. 15 misidentified the German city where the cathedral is the site of a statue for which she was named. It is Naumburg, not Nuremberg.       
         Eleanor Holm Whalen, an Olympic swimming champion who was expelled from the 1936 Berlin Games in a headline-making drinking episode that brought her a second career as a slightly notorious but glamorous show-business figure, died Saturday at her home in Miami.         The cause was kidney failure, said her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Flotron.         By her own account, she would have been 90 at her death, but her sister-in-law said she was 91.         When she boarded the S.S. Manhattan in New York Harbor on July 15, 1936, with some 330 fellow Olympians bound for the Berlin Olympics, Eleanor Holm Jarrett, as she was then known, stood at the pinnacle of the swimming world. She had captured the 100-meter backstroke at the 1932 Los Angeles Games and had set world records in that event and the 200-meter backstroke. She had not lost a race in seven years and was the first female swimmer to be chosen for three American Olympic teams.         But when the ship docked at Hamburg, Germany, she was no longer a member of the Olympic team. The American Olympic Committee and its president, Avery Brundage, had expelled her from the Games for carousing and breaking curfew, an incident that became one of the most publicized flaps in Olympic history.         Her actions seem tame by modern standards, when sports pages have no shortage of accounts detailing drug abuse, criminal behavior and narcissism. But the tale of Olympic partying and drinking that emerged in 1936 enthralled readers who were hardly used to hearing about athletes' lives beyond the playing fields.         Eleanor Holm was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a New York Fire Department officer, and learned to swim at the pool near her family's summer cottage in Long Beach, N.Y.         She finished fifth in the 100-meter backstroke at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. Having won a gold medal in the backstroke at the Los Angeles Games in 1932, she was favored to repeat at the Berlin Olympics. But that was before she incurred the wrath of Brundage, the powerful American Olympic chief.         Holm was both a world-class swimmer and eminently worldly. She had married Art Jarrett, a bandleader, singer and fellow graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, in September 1933. She had appeared with his band, wearing a white bathing suit and white cowboy hat with high heels, singing ''I'm an Old Cowhand.'' She had bit parts in several Warner Brothers movies.         Two days after the Olympians' ship left for the Berlin Games, Holm was invited to an all-night party for sportswriters on the first-class deck. Her drinking there and her violation of curfew brought a warning from Olympic officials.         Then, during a stopover in Cherbourg, France, she won a couple of hundred dollars playing dice with sportswriters aboard the ship during the afternoon. That night, she attended another party with them.         In an interview for ''All That Glitters Is Not Gold,'' by William O. Johnson, she remembered the moment:         ''This chaperone came up to me and told me it was time to go to bed. God, it was about 9 o'clock, and who wanted to go down in that basement to sleep anyway? So I said to her: 'Oh, is it really bedtime? Did you make the Olympic team or did I?' I had had a few glasses of Champagne. So she went to Brundage and complained that I was setting a bad example for the team, and they got together and told me the next morning that I was fired. I was heartbroken.''         According to ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' by David Wallechinsky, the Olympic team doctor had reported that she was suffering from acute alcoholism, but Holm denied it.         Holm maintained that many of her fellow athletes had also been drinking on the voyage because there was no ban on alcohol, and some 200 team members petitioned Brundage to reverse the ban. But Brundage, who ruled amateur athletics in the United States for decades, stood fast.         ''I was everything that Avery Brundage hated,'' Holm said in ''Tales of Gold,'' by Lewis H. Carlson and John J. Fogarty. ''I had a few dollars, and athletes were supposed to be poor. I worked in nightclubs, and athletes shouldn't do that. I was married.''         She went on to recall: ''But he rained on my parade for only a very short time. He did make me famous. I would have been just another female backstroke swimmer without Brundage.''         While Nida Senff of the Netherlands was winning Holm's specialty, the 100-meter backstroke, with American entries finishing third and fourth, Holm joined her sportswriter friends. Hired by the International News Service to file reports on the Games, she became a celebrity presence in the press area, although her articles were ghostwritten.         She also attended receptions held by Hitler and other Nazi leaders. Hermann Goering, the Luftwaffe chief, gave her a silver swastika he took off his uniform. When Holm married Billy Rose, who was Jewish, she had it copied in gold and then placed a Star of David set in diamonds inside it.         After the Olympics, Holm continued in her singing act and was co-featured in the 1938 20th Century Fox movie ''Tarzan's Revenge,'' playing alongside Glenn Morris, the 1936 Olympic decathlon champion, who was cast as Tarzan.         After her divorce from Jarrett in 1939, Holm married Rose, who had obtained a divorce from the comedian Fannie Brice. Co-featured with Johnny Weismuller and then Buster Crabbe, Holm did 39 shows a week at Rose's Aquacade in the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940.         ''I thought I'd never be dry,'' she recalled in ''Tales of Gold.''         ''My hair turned green from the chlorine, and swimming on those cold October and November nights in New York was awful.''         Holm lived with Rose in a five-story, 14-room house on Beekman Place in Manhattan. They were divorced in 1954. She later married Tom Whalen, a retired oil executive, and settled in the Miami area.         She had no children and is survived by two nieces. Whalen died in 1984.         ''I don't swim anymore, I just play tennis,'' she told Dave Anderson of The New York Times in 1984. ''But I still have my 1932 Olympic bathing suit. It's blue with a red, white and blue shield on the front. It's long-waisted with a little skirt. And I don't drink Champagne anymore. Just a little dry white wine.''       
         Mary A. Gardner, a journalism professor whose teaching had a strong influence on contemporary journalism in Mexico and Latin America, died Jan. 22 in East Lansing, Mich., her sister-in-law, Donna Gardner, said. She was 83.         Dr. Gardner's influence in Mexico stemmed from her connection to a former student, Alejandro Junco de la Vega. Mr. Junco, heir to what was then a small family-owned newspaper company that published El Norte in Monterrey, studied journalism with Dr. Gardner at the University of Texas.         When he took over the family business, he turned to his former teacher to help train his staff in reporting, writing and ethics. For more than 20 years, Dr. Gardner spent her summers training reporters at El Norte.         In the mid-1990's, Mr. Junco started a newspaper in Mexico City, Reforma, incorporating the journalistic principles Dr. Gardner helped to instill at El Norte.         Today, Reforma is regarded by many as Mexico's most influential publication.         ''She had an enormous influence on the quality of journalism in Mexico, and in Latin America as well,'' said Richard Cole, dean of the University of North Carolina journalism school and another former student of Dr. Gardner's.         Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, Mary Gardner never intended to be a journalist or a teacher; rather, she aspired to be a physician. A pre-med student at Ohio State University, she was informed that medical school was not an option because she was a woman.         After serving in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II, she earned a master's degree in journalism from Ohio State. In 1960, she received a doctorate in journalism and political science from the University of Minnesota, where she began her teaching career.         In 1961 she moved to the University of Texas, where she was an assistant professor until 1966. She then taught at the Michigan State University School of Journalism until she retired in 1991.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her brother, Porter, of Zoar, Ohio.       
         MARIE C. WILSON, the president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, has the comportment of a seasoned politician. One of the sharper ones. She speaks with passion and laser-beam focus in a soft Georgia accent. Perhaps this impression is enhanced by that snappy red blazer, so bold and camera ready. Maybe it's the good political hair. It stays in place.         In this election year, does she wish she were out there? ''No,'' she says in a quick breath, eager to steer the chat back to her campaign with the White House Project, a nonpartisan group focused on getting women into leadership roles, up to the presidency. Besides, Ms. Wilson, who is 63, has been there, done that. Twenty years ago, she left a seat on the Des Moines City Council, where she got encouragement to run for governor, to lead the Ms. Foundation, which finances hundreds of programs to advance the rights of women and girls.         This brings us to the subject of the white bowler, emblazoned with ''Madame President'' in red, white and blue, propped on Ms. Wilson's computer in her comfortable office on Wall Street. What's with the hat?         Ms. Wilson is convinced that it won't be long before a woman is in the Oval Office. Perhaps in this decade. She thinks this even with nary a woman among the current pack since the withdrawal of Carol Moseley Braun, whom she praises highly.         She rubs her slender hands together fiercely, as if kindling fire. ''This is our time,'' she says. ''I think by 2008, we're going to see several women in the race.'' As president of the five-year-old White House Project, she hopes to recruit and train 1,000 women to become political leaders, and to enlist 25,000 women to get out the vote this year. She hopes to find these women by teaming with sister groups across the country. (She has contacts!)         So getting back to the presidency, who can we expect four years from now? Hillary Rodham Clinton? ''The common thinking is about Hillary Clinton, but there are other women, great women governors out there,'' says Ms. Wilson, a Democrat. She mentions two Democrats, Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, and a Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas.         ''I think we will see two or three women running,'' she continues. ''And that's the point, to get enough women running so they are seen and they're evaluated on their agenda, not just gender, because numbers matter. One woman is always hair, hemline and husband. She has to prove she is man enough for the job.''         One might be tempted to say good luck.         Yet in 1993, people didn't take Ms. Wilson seriously when she had this notion to get parents to take their daughters to their workplaces to focus attention on their potential, not on their problems. Take Our Daughters to Work Day now has the participation of about 15 million adults annually.         ''People would tell us, 'I've always trusted you, but that's the nuttiest thing I've heard,''' she says.         Let's just say, in women Ms. Wilson trusts. She goes into this more in her book, ''Closing the Leadership Gap: Why Women Can and Must Help Run the World,'' due out next month from Viking Press. It is a call to action.         ''Think about what is going on in the country: terrorism, corporate greed,'' she says. ''These are things people are so concerned about that they are glued on the election. And what's an intervention that might have the most positive outcomes? It is bringing in a critical mass of women, a diversity of women, so you get some really different perspectives at the table so we can have different solutions.''         When Ms. Wilson arrived at the Ms. Foundation, there were four staff members and a $500,000 annual budget. The foundation now has a budget of $11 million and 40 employees. One is a man, a receptionist.         SHE describes her life as that of an ordinary American woman. Raised in segregated Atlanta, the daughter of a typesetter and a dental hygienist, she was high school homecoming queen and a cheerleader. She became immersed in civil rights after studying philosophy at Vanderbilt University. Her passion was stoked by a childhood incident in which a white bus driver dragged her crying from the back of the bus where she sat with her black baby sitter.         She married a man who became a minister of music, and followed him to churches in Delaware, Pennsylvania and Iowa, where she developed women's programs at Drake University. Later, she became an educator and human resources director for the Iowa Bankers Association. Her family grew to five children. She divorced. She came to New York to lead the Ms. Foundation.         ''I ended up loving a woman,'' she says simply. ''My relationship is wonderful.''         Her partner of 15 years is Nancy A. Lee, a vice president for business development at The New York Times, and they live in Manhattan.         One senses she would rather keep her private life private. The conversation turns to topics of the day. Same-sex marriage? ''The most important thing is really having the rights,'' she says. ''It's not about the marriage. It's having the same rights that you would get if you were married.''         She is asked if she thinks the foundation, created in 1972, is as relevant today as it was then. Of this, she has no doubt. ''Whether you look at the glass ceiling or the sticky floor, we're still there,'' she says. ''We've stayed in the game.''         PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  February 19, 2004, Thursday  A Public Lives profile on Tuesday about Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, which is trying to involve more women in leadership roles, misstated the type of hat, emblazoned with ''Madame President,'' that sits atop Ms. Wilson's computer. As the picture showed, it is a boater, with a flat crown and brim, not a bowler, which would have a round crown and curved brim.       
         Irma Fleck, a physician's wife who looked at the vacant lots and abandoned buildings of her South Bronx neighborhood and retaliated by starting organizations to celebrate art and turn rubble piles into emerald oases, died on Feb. 11 in Naples, Fla.         She was 84 and lived in Naples.         The cause was complications after a broken hip, said her daughter, Bonnie Oppenberg.         Among many other initiatives, Mrs. Fleck helped develop the Claremont Neighborhood Center in the South Bronx, the Bronx Council on the Arts and the Bronx Museum. She also hatched a plan to turn compost from the Hunts Point Market into compost for developing lots that had been ravaged by arson.         ''When I work at something, it's like my child,'' she said in an interview with Newsday in 1994. ''I work intensively, and whatever the project, it becomes very important to me.''         Herman Badillo, a former Bronx borough president, said in an interview yesterday that he remembered Mrs. Fleck as being very aggressive in pursuing project after project.         ''She was one of the most active volunteers in the Bronx,'' he said.         Fernando Ferrer, another former Bronx borough president, said in an interview with The Riverdale Press last week that Mrs. Fleck ''put her own stamp on the Bronx in a very important way.''         Irma Lowenthal was born on Oct. 28, 1919, in Poland, the second of three children. Her father, a doctor, ran his practice out of the family's home near Crotona Park, in the heart of the South Bronx. In the three-story house, the family often put up Jewish refugees who like themselves had fled Hitler.         Miss Lowenthal graduated from Walton High School, earned degrees from Queens College and New York University and worked for her father as an X-ray technician. In 1940, she married Henry Fleck, a physician who had fled Europe in 1932. The newlyweds moved in with relatives on Washington Avenue in the Bronx.         The couple continued living in the Washington Avenue house, where Mrs. Fleck had two children, who survive her, Mrs. Oppenberg, of Marco Island, Fla., and Gary Fleck of Safat, Israel. She is also survived by two brothers, both of whom live in New Jersey, and two grandsons. Dr. Fleck died in 1990.         She believed a physician's wife should be active in the community in which he worked and in 1956 was a founder of the Claremont Neighborhood Center on East 169th Street. She was its president for 11 years, successfully pushing initiatives for affordable housing.         The Flecks moved to a penthouse on the Grand Concourse in the 1960's, and in the 1970's Mrs. Fleck held meetings there to try to reverse the decline of the South Bronx. Eventually, these meetings and contacts would lead to the Bronx Museum, which Mrs. Fleck helped found, forming a group in 1986 called the Committee to Make the Concourse Grand Again.         In 1967, Mrs. Fleck formed the Bronx Committee on the Arts. It soon merged with the Bronx Council on the Arts, formed by Gerald Klot in 1961. Mr. Klot's long involvement in the arts in the Bronx included organizing the Bronx Symphony Orchestra in 1945.         The new organization took the name of Mr. Klot's organization and found a home at the Bronx Community College, part of the City University of New York.         At first, ''We had a couple of drawers in a file there,'' Mrs. Fleck said in an interview with The New York Times in 1971.         The council soon found itself coordinating a host of cultural groups, including the Bronx Opera Company, the Bronx Experimental Theater, the Festival of Poetry and the Bronx Showcase of the Visual Arts.         Mrs. Fleck, as executive director of the council, was proudest of her role in creating the museum. It was housed until 1982 in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse, and from the beginning its exhibitions focused on contemporary artists, minority artists and artists from the Bronx.         In 1982, the museum took over the former Young Israel of the Concourse Synagogue, on the corner of 165th Street and the Grand Concourse, which had been sold to the city by its dwindling congregation. Mrs. Fleck raised public and private money to build an exhibition gallery, classrooms and offices, as well as a new glass-walled lobby.         Perhaps her best known accomplishment was collecting spoiling produce from the huge wholesale center at Hunts Point and selling it for compost. With Jack Flanagan, a former police officer, she formed the Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, which collected as much as 40 tons of compost daily.         The compost was used to fertilize new gardens on vacant lots. ''We're in the recycling business,'' Mrs. Fleck said. ''We're recycling land.''         When the vegetable market began to bag its waste in plastic, Mrs. Fleck persuaded the Bronx Zoo to give her the droppings of elephants and other herbivores to use for fertilizer. She called it ZooDoo, and sold some of it in two-pound bags for $2.50 in smart Manhattan stores.       
         Trude Wenzel Lash, inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become a children's advocate through the Citizens Commission for Children of New York, died on Wednesday at her home in Greenwich Village, her family said. She was 95.         Mrs. Lash was an early mainstay of the commission, which Mrs. Roosevelt helped found in 1944. Mrs. Lash, a refugee from Germany who befriended Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt, became the commission's program director in 1946 and was its executive director from 1952 to 1972.         After that, Mrs. Lash devoted herself to the Roosevelt legacy through the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y. Until 2000, she was the institute's co-chairwoman with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and at her death both were honorary chairmen of the institute, housed at the Franklin Roosevelt Library.         Trude Lash was born Gertrud Wenzel in June 1908 in Freiburg, Germany. A rebellious girl and brilliant student, she was thrown out of convent school, went on to study journalism in Berlin and, while teaching kindergarten and first grade, attended the University of Heidelberg.         At the University of Freiburg, she received a doctorate in philosophy in 1930. She came to New York for a year as an exchange teacher of philosophy and German literature at Hunter College while doing graduate work in the social sciences at Columbia.         Back in Germany, she wrote for a newspaper opposed to the Nazis. But in 1932 she returned to New York for good as the wife of Eliot D. Pratt, a member of a socially prominent family, and the couple helped other refugees from Europe find their way to the United States. They were divorced in 1943, and he died in 1969.         In 1944, she married Joseph P. Lash, a journalist and confidant of Eleanor Roosevelt, who played matchmaker to the couple. Mr. Lash wrote the two-volume biography ''Eleanor and Franklin,'' published in 1972.         Mrs. Lash, who worked for the Human Rights Commission at the United Nations before joining the staff of the Citizens Commission for Children, collected data on the status of children in New York for major studies in 1976 and 1980. She was principal investigator for the studies' reports, called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' The reports were influential in inspiring similar studies elsewhere.         After retiring, she continued her advocacy through the Foundation for Child Development and became directly involved in the Roosevelt memorials. After Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962, Congress had authorized an Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. Mrs. Lash helped establish the combined Franklin and Eleanor Institute in 1984 and until just before her death remained a consultant on Roosevelt memorabilia.         Trude Wenzel Lash is survived by three sons, Dr. Peter W. Pratt of Bridgewater, Conn., Roger S. Pratt of New Milford, Conn., and Jonathan Lash of Washington; a daughter, Vera C. Pratt, also of Washington; a brother, Heinz Wenzel of Germany; 11 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. Joseph Lash died in 1987.         Her commission work, which ranged from studying day care and foster care to juvenile detention, often involved sending volunteers to institutions to see how children were treated. It sometimes led to confrontations with officialdom.         ''All too often we take our most difficult children and we turn over their care to professionals, and we leave the matter,'' Trude Lash said in an interiew with The New York Times in 1972. ''But professionals, even good ones, are primarily interested in their jobs and their routines. What is needed is someone who is primarily interested in the children.''         Correction:  February 7, 2004, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Trude Wenzel Lash, an advocate for children in New York City, misstated the name of the organization for which she worked until 1972. It is the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, not Citizens Commission. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the name of the organization for which she later worked on reports called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' It is the Foundation for Child Development, not the committee.       
         Frances Partridge, the last of the spectacularly talented and irreverent group of British writers and artists who coalesced as the Bloomsbury group in the years before World War I, died in London on Feb. 5. She was 103.         Ms. Partridge's death was announced by her literary agency, Rogers, Coleridge & White Ltd., which said she died in her apartment. She was surrounded there by remnants of the Bloomsbury group's heyday, including their books, one of them the letters of her friend Virginia Woolf, and their art, including the painter Dora Carrington's famous portrait of Lytton Strachey.         She was one of the last firsthand chroniclers of Bloomsbury, publishing two volumes of autobiography and six volumes of her diaries, beginning when she was 78. The books captivated a public increasingly fascinated by the socialist, pacifist and intellectually superior -- not to mention sexually adventurous -- bohemians of Bloomsbury, a leafy central London neighborhood.         Her story seemed as much literature as life, even as it was lived. When Ralph Partridge and Frances Marshall fell in love in 1923, Ralph was married to Dora Carrington, who was in love with Strachey, an eminent biographer and critic. But Strachey was in love with Ralph, who, Frances wrote, was ''hopelessly heterosexual'' and could not reciprocate. All, of course, lived in the same house.         Such was life among the Bloomsbury group, whose members also included John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Roger Fry, the art historian who coined the term Post-Impressionism. The group was not a school, as is commonly understood in artistic circles, but a remarkably talented collection of intellectuals who liked to eat good French food and converse, among other activities.         Ms. Partridge was actually on the fringes of the group, somewhat distantly connected by marriage to Duncan Grant, the Post-Impressionist painter and designer, as well as by her husband's first marriage, to Carrington. Another link was Julia Strachey, Lytton Strachey's niece and Ms. Partridge's oldest friend.         Ms. Partridge survived another old friend, the Shakespearean scholar George Rylands, who died in 1999, making her the last person who experienced the Bloomsbury phenomenon close up as an adult. (Angelica Garnett, the daughter of Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf's sister, published a well-reviewed book about her Bloomsbury childhood, ''Deceived by Kindness,'' in 1985.)         Ms. Partridge staked her claim to Bloomsbury history by writing it down. She suggested she survived to be ''some kind of archive.''         She brought life to her account, writing of Keynes's wife, the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, as ''a delightful little person,'' and likening Forster's laugh to a sneeze. She told how Fry explained ''in his beautiful deep voice why it was wicked to like peacock blue.'' Virginia Woolf, she said, had ''irresistible cracked charm.''         Frances Catherine Marshall was born in London on March 15, 1900, and was brought up on Bedford Square, in the heart of Bloomsbury. Her father was William Cecil Marshall, an architect, the runner-up in the first Wimbledon final in 1877 and a friend of Darwin. Her mother, the former Margaret Anna Lloyd, was a suffragist who took the 6-year-old Frances to a protest. Henry James, a family chum, cuddled her as a baby.         An atheist by 12, Ms. Partridge attended Bedales, a progressive school where naked swimming was allowed, except off the high dive, ''since it was 12 feet high and its occupant was visible for miles,'' she wrote.         Ms. Partridge attended Cambridge, where she went ''dancing mad'' and studied English for two years, then switched to courses she hoped would lead to a job in applied psychology. They did: she researched why waitresses drop china.         She soon took a job in a bookstore frequented by Bloomsbury figures. Among them was her future husband, Reginald Sherring Partridge, known as Ralph. A World War I hero and former Oxford rower, he was an employee of Hogarth Press, owned by Leonard and Virginia Woolf.         Frances and Ralph married in 1933, a year after Strachey died. His death had led Carrington to commit suicide. The couple were awakened by their gardener with the news, an oft-noted detail.         ''I would have thought people would find it rather dull, but they still seem fascinated,'' Ms. Partridge said in 1994, speaking of the events surrounding the ménage. ''I supposed because Carrington died for love.''         Together, the Partridges spent nine years editing the eight volumes of Charles C. F. Greville's memoirs, which recorded three British monarchs' reigns. In the years after the war, Ms. Partridge became known as a translator of French and Spanish books.         She was devastated by the deaths of her husband, in 1960, and of their son, Burgo, named for a Trollope character, three years later. She wrote of ''the black velvet oblivion I dream about.''         She is survived by her granddaughter, Sophie, and two great-granddaughters.         In 1978, at 78, she published ''A Pacifist's War,'' a memoir of the World War II years, following it three years later with ''Love in Bloomsbury: Memories,'' which led Anatole Broyard, writing in The New York Times, to conclude that the denizens of Bloomsbury may have been ''too charming for their own good.''         The books kept coming, just as her violin performances (she was an accomplished musician) continued well into her 90's. Craig Brown, a British critic who reviewed her fifth and penultimate volume of daily journals, ''Diaries: 1939-1972'' (2001), thought that the story went on a bit.         ''There are an awful lot of days when nothing of general interest really happens: someone we have never heard of drops by for lunch (full menu included) with a second person we have never heard of, and they all gossip vaguely about what a third person we never heard of thinks of a fourth person we never heard of,'' he wrote.         In 2001 another critic, Adam Nicolson, provided something of an explanation, writing that Ms. Partridge, who in her later years was sometimes compared to the Queen Mother as an English institution, lived ''her life in complete sentences.''       
         Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Robert.         In 12 books and many other writings, Dr. McCord, a professor at Temple University, disputed the effectiveness in fighting crime of boys' clubs, summer camps, programs in which young offenders visit prisons, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and other popular programs.         The first woman to be president of the American Society of Criminology, she was known for her use of longitudinal studies, which follow subjects for many years. Her goal was to examine the long-term effects of programs, ranging from individual mentoring programs often favored by conservatives to social work efforts frequently advocated by liberals.         Dr. McCord believed that just as the government monitors the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, the public should examine data to determine if well-meaning interventions to help people might, in fact, be harmful. Often, she found that programs had no built-in procedure to evaluate their success.         More troubling, she said, was that officials sometimes resisted evaluation of programs, in part because they regarded it as an affront to their good intentions. She also said she sensed a fear that solid criticism of one social program might brand all as ineffective.         ''That fear, perhaps justified in some quarters, would be like blocking publication of damaging effects of Celebrex, thalidomide, or estrogen because the publication could slow work in disease prevention,'' she wrote in the May 2003 issue of The Annals, the publication of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.         Her best-known longitudinal study was her 1978 follow-up on a youth-mentoring program done 30 years earlier in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass. She found that boys at high risk who had been given mentors, health-care services and summer camp fared worse in later life than a similar group of boys who were given nothing special. The 250 boys who got special services were more likely to become criminals, have trouble in their jobs and marriages, and become alcoholics, according to court, hospital and other records noted in her study.         A possible reason, Dr. McCord suggested, was that those boys had felt they were given the attention because something was wrong with them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Her theory was that the boys who went to summer camp modeled themselves after camp troublemakers.         The counterintuitive result contradicted the statements of two-thirds of the participants that the program had helped them by giving them better values and keeping them off the streets.         In other studies, she found that some youths counseled by court-appointed volunteers fared worse than those who received no counseling. Her statistical analysis of a program in Australia that provided recreation for troubled adolescents found bad effects. And participants in the Scared Straight program, which takes young offenders from many locales to visit prisons, were arrested more often than a control group, she found.         She said that D.A.R.E., the popular nationwide ''just say no'' drug education program in which law enforcement officers spend time in schools talking about drugs, alcohol and violence, may actually have contributed to drug use, according to her analysis of statistics from the program.         Joan Fish was born in Manhattan on Aug. 4, 1930. After graduating from Stanford in 1952, she did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard and Stanford. She earned her doctorate in sociology from Stanford in 1968.         She wrote some of her early papers with her first husband, William M. McCord. Their marriage ended in divorce. Both he and her second husband, Carl A. Silver, are dead.         Dr. McCord is survived by her sons, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord of Durham, N.C., and Robert McCord of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; her ward, whom she regarded as a family member, Tom Underwood of Boston; her brother, Robert Fish of Santa Cruz, Calif.; her sister, Connie Arnosti of Milwaukee; and four grandsons.         Her often pithy remarks appeared in articles about crime in many newspapers and magazines. The New York Times in 1996 asked her about a 12-year-old arrested on charges of gang rape and murder and who was turned in by his mother.         Of the mother's dilemma, Dr. McCord said, ''It's almost impossible to imagine a good thing to do with a gun-toting 12-year-old.''       
         Lisa Gubernick, an author and reporter who wrote about the entertainment industry for The Wall Street Journal and as the Hollywood correspondent for Forbes magazine, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 48 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was colon cancer, said Laurie Cohen, a family friend.         Ms. Gubernick began her career writing about finance. She became a senior writer at The American Lawyer in 1984 and started its spinoff newsletter Takeover Control Alert. She joined Forbes in July 1984, was its Hollywood correspondent from 1987 to 1990, and became a senior editor in 1990. She joined The Journal in 1998, covering entertainment for its Weekend Journal section.         She wrote ''Squandered Fortune: The Life and Times of Huntington Hartford'' (Putnam, 1991) and ''Get Hot or Go Home: Trisha Yearwood, The Making of a Nashville Star'' (Morrow, 1993).         Ms. Gubernick was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College.         She is survived by her mother, Grace, of Manhattan; her husband, Paul Fishleder, an editor at The New York Times; and her daughter, Lily.       
         Jane Wood, a longtime tenant advocate and political radical in New York who once pressured her landlord to replace a broken elevator by sleeping on an air mattress in the lobby, died on Wednesday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Wood died from respiratory complications stemming from a fall last month in which she fractured a rib, said her stepson, Timothy Wood.         Considered a giant in the tenants' rights movement, Ms. Wood was credited by housing advocates for helping to prevent the eviction of hundreds, if not thousands, of tenants, as her Chelsea neighborhood became gentrified. She was the founder of the Chelsea Coalition on Housing, an advocacy group for low-income tenants, and could always deliver a rousing speech at tenant protests, Rent Guidelines Board meetings or neighborhood rallies.         Ms. Wood was one of the last of a breed of activists whose socialist sensibilities were shaped by the Depression, though not through personal deprivation. Ms. Wood was born into a family of means, a world she eventually rejected to help the downtrodden.         Born Janet Kauffman in 1907, Ms. Wood grew up in St. Louis as the only child of Harold M. Kauffman, a wealthy banker, and Jeanette Morton, a socialite and Mayflower descendant. She was related to the Davis family, the namesake of the Davis Cup of tennis. And while Ms. Wood attended Smith College, her sorority mentor was Anne Morrow, the writer who later married Charles A. Lindbergh, her stepson said.         After moving to New York City in the 1930's, Ms. Wood became active in socialist causes and tried to help the poor. ''She felt that what she saw was terrible, and she felt that she had to do something for those less fortunate,'' Mr. Wood said.         In the 1940's, she married Robert Wood, a fellow activist, who later opened a business importing cigars. He died in 1963. Ms. Wood is survived by her stepson and a stepdaughter, Sara Gearry, of Coeburn, Va.         Because of her husband's cigar business, Ms. Wood traveled to Cuba. She made numerous trips there after the embargo was imposed, ferrying medical supplies and other goods. She met Fidel Castro as well, and to the end praised his communist regime, said Kernan Huttick, treasurer and tenant organizer with the Chelsea Coalition on Housing.         Ms. Wood founded the Chelsea group in the 1950's after protesting plans to build the Penn Station South housing development, a middle-income cooperative. The complex ultimately went up, but Ms. Wood helped ensure that the low-income workers who lost their homes were given priority in the new housing.         In the 1990's, one of Ms. Wood's notable fights involved the eviction of several women living at Leo House, a women's residence affiliated with Catholic Charities. Though Leo House ultimately won the fight, the evictions were stalled for several years.         In 2001, Ms. Wood staged what may have been her most colorful protest: sleeping in the lobby of her apartment building to pressure the landlord to hasten the replacement of the elevator, which at that point had been out of service for months. She installed an air mattress in the lobby and went to bed there in a nightgown and nightcap.       
         Princess Juliana, the modest and beloved queen of The Netherlands for 32 years, died early Saturday. She was 94.         The government announced that she had died of pneumonia at the Soestdijk Palace, her longtime home, surrounded by three of her four daughters, including Queen Beatrix. Her fourth daughter, Christina, arrived shortly afterward from New York.         Remembering Juliana, who reigned from 1948 to 1980, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende praised her sense of duty and personal warmth. ''In her own words, she had wanted to be a social worker if she had not been queen,'' he said.         In one way, she was a social worker. Born to privilege and wealth, Juliana made much effort, both as the queen and after she turned over her throne to her daughter, to bring the monarchy closer to the people. She spent much time visiting the sick, the handicapped, the aged and needy children. By many accounts, she helped steer successive governments toward policies promoting social welfare.         Her personal popularity probably helped save the monarchy during several severe crises, when critics agitated for the country to abandon the rituals and symbols of the past and become a modern republic.         Juliana spent her final years in seclusion. For some time she had been unable to recognize her family because of memory loss, said her husband, Prince Bernard, in 2001.         Mr. Balkenende, the prime minister, described her as a mother figure for the nation. ''Many of us feel the death of Princess Juliana as a personal loss,'' he said. ''Today our country in a sense has lost its mother.''         Flags were immediately lowered at Dutch official buildings, and mourners gathered in the rain outside her palace, about 25 miles southeast of Amsterdam. No date for the state burial has been set.         Born April 30, 1909 in The Hague, Juliana was a princess of the House of Orange-Nassau, the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik. She was 39 when her mother, who had been queen for 50 years, abdicated in her favor and passed the throne to her on Sept. 4, 1948.         Although Juliana was brought up in one of Europe's richest families, many Dutch found her endearing because, shy and soft-spoken, she exuded warmth and plainness. She said she found curtsies embarrassing and enjoyed being filmed while riding her bicycle in a flowery housewife's dress. She sent her children to state schools.         She would sometimes have her limousine pull up unannounced outside the home of one of her subjects, knock on the door and ask if she could come in for tea.         But her life was far from idyllic.         She and her husband, Prince Bernard, a German, and their two oldest daughters, then infants, were forced to flee in a truck, then by ship, to England when the Nazi army invaded The Netherlands in 1940, when her mother was still queen. The family spent much of the war in Canada and returned to a devastated, impoverished country at the end of the war.         Among her first acts as a young queen was not only overseeing reconstruction at home, but also dealing with conflicts in the Dutch colony of Indonesia. She handed back sovereignty to the Indonesians in in 1949.         In 1947, Christina, her youngest daughter, was born almost blind. Juliana blamed herself because she had contracted German measles just before giving birth.         With doctors saying they could do little, she turned to a faith healer. Her close relationship with Greet Hofmans, the healer -- who was a militant pacifist and had a penchant for the occult -- became a scandal and nearly led to the breakup of the royal marriage. The prince contended that the healer had a dangerous influence on his wife and, after a political furor, ensured that all contacts between the two women were broken.         Queen Juliana, in turn, stood by her husband during several scandals in which he was involved. Prince Bernard was often linked to extramarital relationships, which were treated as a public secret within the royal family and in some of the Dutch and European press.         But the greater upset to her reign occurred in 1976, when the government disclosed that Prince Bernard was involved in a bribery scandal and had accepted ''dishonorable offers and favors'' from the Lockheed Corp., which was eager to sell aircraft to the Dutch military.         The prince, by many accounts, was spared criminal prosecution because of public sympathy for Queen Juliana's plight. The distraught queen privately told the government she would abdicate. Fearing a constitutional crisis and a public outcry, the government merely stripped the prince of his military, charitable and diplomatic tasks.         When Juliana did abdicate, in 1980, on her 71st birthday, she took evident pride in handing the throne to her daughter Beatrix. ''Everyone getting older, sooner or later must face the sober fact that one's strength is fading,'' she said in her farewell message, adding that it would not be responsible to carry on.         She declined the title of queen mother and chose to be called princess instead because she wanted to stress that she was taking a step backward.         Princess Juliana is survived by her husband and four daughters and numerous grandchildren.         In a nationwide television address on Saturday, Prime Minister Balkenende recalled Juliana's fight for social causes and her talent for remaining positive.         She put people at ease, he said. He described one of Juliana's Christmas messages, when she said, ''Every person has a light that can shine anywhere and anytime.''       
         Mary B. Goodhue, a longtime New York State senator who lost her seat in 1992 in a rare Republican primary to a little-known assemblyman by the name of George E. Pataki, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital, her son, Francis A. Goodhue III, said. She was 82 and lived in Bedford, N.Y.         Mrs. Goodhue had represented northern Westchester and Putnam Counties in the State Legislature for 18 years, first in the Assembly and for seven terms in the Senate, when she was challenged in a Republican primary by Mr. Pataki, a protégé of hers who had once worked on her Senate staff as legislative counsel.         It was the year women running for political office across the nation had named ''the year of the woman,'' and Mrs. Goodhue, who was 71, was the only woman in the State Senate's Republican majority. That spring she had announced she would retire; a few days later, at the urging of party leaders, she changed her mind.         But Mr. Pataki, then 47, decided to challenge her anyway. It was a rare spectacle in state politics: a bitter primary in a party that usually avoids public squabbles. Mr. Pataki campaigned from the right, casting his former boss as too liberal.         Mrs. Goodhue told voters that year that Mr. Pataki was ''a very nice fellow; the only thing is, how come he wants my seat?'' In his autobiography, Mr. Pataki recalled the race as ''an arduous primary battle against an enormously popular incumbent.'' He won narrowly, and the statewide attention that the race drew helped set him on his path to the governorship.         Governor Pataki issued a statement yesterday expressing his condolences to Mrs. Goodhue's family and announcing that he had ordered the flags at the State Capitol in Albany and elsewhere to be flown at half-staff in her honor. ''Mary Goodhue was a dedicated public servant who had a long and distinguished career and contributed much to the greatness of our state, and particularly to Westchester and the Hudson Valley region,'' he said.         Mrs. Goodhue, who was born in London in 1921, became an American citizen as a child. She graduated from Vassar College and earned her law degree from the University of Michigan. As a lawyer, she worked for several firms and at the New York State Crime Commission from 1951 to 1953. She founded her own firm -- Goodhue, Arons & Neary, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y. -- and worked there until 2002.         In the Senate, Mrs. Goodhue, the chairwoman of the committee on child care, investigated violations at day care centers, delved into minutia of the state's complex school financing formulas, and introduced legislation regulating surrogate mothers.         Mrs. Goodhue was married for 42 years to Francis A. Goodhue Jr., who died in 1990. She is survived by her son, of Bedford, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  April 3, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of former New York State Senator Mary B. Goodhue on March 26 misstated the name of the her law firm at its founding; it was Goodhue & Lange. (It later became Goodhue, Arons & Neary; it is now Arons & Neary.)       
         Jane Engelhard, a philanthropist and art collector whose many gifts ranged from major donations to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Christmas crèche displayed at the White House, died on Sunday at her home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 86.         The cause was pneumonia, her daughter Annette de la Renta said.         As the wife of Charles Engelhard, owner of a vast international business empire, she helped Jacqueline Kennedy restore the White House, regularly made best-dressed lists and was such a fixture of New York society, its own magazines recounted, that socialites affectionately called her ''Our Mother Superior.'' After Mr. Engelhard's death in 1971, Mrs. Engelhard continued to display eclectic taste in her personal collecting, picking up rarities like the original presidential proclamation of the Louisiana Purchase as well as the perhaps predictable Monets.         Her gifts to the Met included the Charles Engelhard Court in the museum's American Wing in 1980. She was a trustee from 1974 until 1981, when she became a trustee emeritus.         She also gave to many smaller institutions, including the Newark Museum and the New Jersey Symphony, paying all of the salary expenses of the orchestra in some years.         Her contributions often went beyond money, as when she and Laurance S. Rockefeller and Brooke Astor in 1976 came up with the idea of planting a grove along the Potomac River to honor President Lyndon B. Johnson. From the administration of John F. Kennedy to that of George W. Bush, she served on committees to preserve the White House.         Jane Pinto-Reis Brian was born on Aug. 12, 1917, in Qingdao, China, where her father was serving as Brazil's ambassador. The family moved to Paris, where she was educated at the Couvent des Oiseaux.         Vogue reported that ''at 16 or so, black-eyed, confident and competent beyond her years,'' she married Fritz Mannheimer, a Dutch banker and, like Mr. Engelhard, thought to be one of the world's richest men. Eight weeks after they wed, Dr. Mannheimer died. The next day, his investment house closed, bankrupt.         She did inherit a microfilm company that copied United States war records and material for the Library of Congress, on whose board she later served. She was executive vice president of the microfilm company. After five years there, she married Mr. Engelhard, whose portfolio (ranging from gold, platinum, diamonds and timber to racehorses like Nijinsky II, a winner of the English Triple Crown) was once referred to as ''a consortium of conglomerates.''         They had houses in Johannesburg, in Maine and on the Gaspé Peninsula of Canada, and apartments in Manhattan, Rome and London. But they spent most of their time at their estate in Far Hills, N.J., where they kept champion golden retrievers and a pet lion roamed.         The Engelhards were active in Democratic Party politics. President Kennedy dispatched them as his representatives on diplomatic occasions.         President Johnson continued to send the Engelhards on diplomatic missions. But they proved even more useful as a bridge between Kennedy and Johnson loyalists.         In addition to Mrs. de la Renta, who lives in Manhattan and Kent, Conn., Mrs. Engelhard is survived by her four other daughters, Susan O'Connor of Missoula, Mont.; Sophie Craighead of Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Sally Pingree of Washington; and Charlene Engelhard of Concord, Mass.; two sisters, Brigitte de la Rochefoucauld of Paris and Madame Jacque Bemberg of Lausanne, Switzerland; 12 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Marge Schott, who evoked the image of a charming eccentric when she bought the Cincinnati Reds in 1984 but became a baseball pariah for offensive racial and ethnic remarks, died yesterday in Cincinnati. She was 75.         Her death was announced by Christ Hospital, where she had been treated for several weeks. She had lung-related problems in recent years, The Associated Press said.         When she took control of the Reds, Mrs. Schott, a socially prominent widow and heir to an industrial fortune, was the only female owner in the major leagues who had bought a team in her own right. Joan Kroc of the San Diego Padres and Jean Yawkey of the Boston Red Sox had inherited their franchises from their husbands.         She appeared at her introductory news conference with her 170-pound St. Bernard, Schottzie, who, clad in a Reds cap, perched on the feet of Manager Pete Rose. She maintained that in purchasing the team, she might have prevented its move out of Cincinnati. It seemed that she might be an astute baseball promoter, and she was a formidable contributor to Cincinnati area charities.         But a series of gaffes and intolerant remarks caused Mrs. Schott to lose control of the Reds in 1999. In her 15 years as owner, a franchise that had thrived in the 1970's as the Big Red Machine had seven managers but only one pennant-winner, the World Series champions of 1990.         Mrs. Schott's image first soured in November 1992 when several former Reds executives said that she had referred to players and business associates using racial and ethnic slurs. In an interview that month with The New York Times, she said that ''Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far.''         Mrs. Schott denied she was a racist, but acknowledged she had sometimes used a racial epithet.         Asked in a deposition for a lawsuit brought by a former Reds employee if she was prejudiced against Jews in light of possessing a Nazi armband -- a war souvenir -- she responded: ''No. They are not smarter than us, just sharper.'' The uproar over Mrs. Schott's remarks prompted baseball's leadership to suspend her from day-to-day oversight of the Reds for the 1993 season. After she made a similar comment about Hitler in May 1996, she was forced to relinquish her daily control of the Reds again and she never regained it.         In October 1999, Mrs. Schott turned over control of the team to a group headed by Carl Lindner, one of the limited partners, in a $67 million deal. She remained in Reds ownership as a limited partner.         Mrs. Schott was a major contributor to local charitable causes, including Children's Hospital and the Cincinnati Zoo.         ''Marge was a paradox,'' Mayor Charlie Luken of Cincinnati told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon her death. ''While there is no excusing some of the indelicate things she said, there was a kindness to Marge that made her a woman of the people.''         She was born Margaret Unnewehr, the second of five daughters of Edward Unnewehr, a Cincinnati native who made a fortune in the lumber business.         ''My father was Achtung-German,'' Mrs. Schott recalled in 1992. ''He used to ring a bell when he wanted my mother. When I was 21 and went to vote, he told me who to vote for. I said, 'Yes, Daddy.' ''         She married Charles Schott, a member of a wealthy Cincinnati family, in 1952, and gained notice for the parties she held for friends and charities at her mansion in the suburb of Indian Hill.         When her husband died of a heart attack in 1968, Mrs. Schott inherited auto dealerships in Cincinnati and interests in insurance, brick manufacturing, concrete products and landfills.         She became a limited partner in the Reds' ownership in 1981 and was named the general partner on Dec. 21, 1984, when she purchased the controlling interest held by the brothers James and William Williams and shares held by two other limited partners, reportedly for $11 million.         Mrs. Schott called her purchase of the Reds a ''Christmas gift to the people of Cincinnati.'' She said she was concerned that the Williams brothers might sell the franchise, which reported $4 million in losses in 1984, to an out-of-city group.         Mrs. Schott promoted the team at functions, and she loved to take part in the Wave from her box seat at Riverfront Stadium. But the allegations in 1992 concerning offensive remarks tarnished her image.         The next February, baseball's executive council suspended Mrs. Schott for the 1993 season and fined her $25,000 for ''the most base and demeaning type of racial and ethnic stereotyping.''         Mrs. Schott had apologized for any offensive remarks, but in an interview for ABC-TV's ''Primetime Live'' after the suspension, she suggested the inquiry was a ''witch hunt'' and said, ''I think if I had been a man this would never have happened.''         A month after that suspension was imposed, baseball's executive council banned Schottzie 02 -- another of her St. Bernards -- from the Riverfront Stadium field, citing ''numerous complaints by the players.''         Mrs. Schott had no children, to her great regret. She bestowed great affection on her dogs and delighted in parading with her St. Bernards around the Reds' ballpark and rubbing the dogs' fur on her players.         In yet another incident, Lou Piniella, who had taken the Reds to the World Series championship in his first year as manager, rejected a two-year contract extension after the 1992 season. He said later that a major factor in his leaving was the failure of the Reds' management to support him in a defamation suit -- later dropped -- that was filed by Umpire Gary Darling and the Major League Umpires Association.         Another embarrassment for Mrs. Schott arrived in 1996.         After the season-opening game at Cincinnati had been called off when Umpire John McSherry sustained a fatal heart attack in the first inning, Mrs. Schott told The Cincinnati Enquirer: ''I feel cheated. Nobody feels worse than me.''         She compounded that gaffe with her sympathy offering to the umpiring crew; according to published reports, it was a recycled bouquet given to her by the team's television affiliate.         On June 12, 1996, Mrs. Schott agreed to give up daily operation of the Reds through the 1998 season, having been told by baseball's executive council that she would be suspended again if she did not do so. She turned over day-to-day affairs to John Allen, the team's controller.         Mrs. Schott is survived by her sisters, Charlotte Crane, Winnie Fraser, Caroline Paddock and Mary Elizabeth Unnewehr.         ''I guess I always thought of her as a tragic figure,'' the former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent told The Associated Press. ''I think she tried very hard to do the right things for baseball, but she had some enormous limitations and she had some difficulty overcoming them.''       
         Mary Lindsay, who as John V. Lindsay's accomplished, blue-blood wife brought casual elegance and political acumen to his campaigns for New York City mayor and other offices while fiercely protecting the family's limited privacy, died yesterday in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, her daughter Margaret Picotte said. Mrs. Lindsay lived in Hilton Head, S.C.         Mr. Lindsay, who was mayor from 1966 to 1973, died on Dec. 19, 2000, at age 79.         Mrs. Lindsay, whose energy was suggested by her vigorous bicycle rides in Central Park and the countless coffee hours she held during her husband's campaigns, was her husband's most trusted adviser. James Reston described her in The New York Times as ''smarter than 16 Yale men,'' and Mr. Lindsay once volunteered that she was tougher than he was.         ''You can say anything in front of Mary,'' he said in a remark quoted by Vogue magazine in 1969. ''Besides, it'll save me having to tell her all over again.''         Mrs. Lindsay preceded Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis by three years at Miss Porter's School and Vassar and redecorated Gracie Mansion in the fine manner in which the first lady had made over the White House. But Mrs. Lindsay thought designer gowns were a waste of money and bought her clothes off the shelf in department stores. Reflecting her political sagacity, she explained that locally made clothes were a critical part of the city's economy.         Her never-disguised devotion to her children struck a responsive chord with many mothers.         ''I have a strict rule,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1971. ''Nothing is scheduled for me after 4 p.m. That's when Johnnie comes home from school.''         She was also protective of her husband's most precious asset, time -- not to mention his peace of mind.         ''When he needs something done I may scream around the house,'' she said in a 1969 interview with The Times. ''But when he gets home, it's all peaches and cream.''         Mary Anne Harrison was born on Oct. 30, 1926, in Richmond, Va. Her father, Randolph Carter Harrison, was a senior vice president of Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. Her mother, the former Mary Hawes, was president of the Garden Club of America.         She and her two brothers grew up in Greenwich, Conn. She enjoyed a tomboy's life, developing a reputation for independence. She needed only three years to graduate from Vassar in 1947 with a degree in psychology.         In her last year of college, she and John met when they were members of the wedding party of Nancy Walker Bush, sister of the former president George H. W. Bush, and Alexander Ellis. Mrs. Lindsay told The Post in 1965 that she first thought Mr. Lindsay was ''horrid'' because he did not pay any attention to her.         ''Later, when we knew each other a lot better, he said he had been assigned to be very nice to the groom's younger sister,'' she said. ''I now accept that.''         In 1948, in the kitchen of his parents' home, he asked her to marry him, she said. But he maintained he was only getting a beer.         ''He still says that,'' she said. ''But I know John. If he wanted to get out of something, he would have managed.''         Before her marriage she taught at the Mary C. Wheeler School in Providence, R.I., and at the Buckley School in New York.         They were married in June 1949 and moved into a $63-a-month apartment in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, according to Diplomat magazine. Mr. Lindsay was making $3,600 a year with his law firm. After the couple's first two children were born, they moved into a larger Stuyvesant Town residence that cost $83 a month. Eventually, they bought a $10,000 co-op.         She at first thought she would devote herself to being a homemaker. ''I thought it would be glorious,'' she said to The Post. ''Nothing to do but clean and be a good little housewife. I was bored to death.''         She soon got a job at a nearby nursery school until her first child, now Katharine Lake, of Connecticut, was born.         In addition to her, Mrs. Lindsay is survived by two other daughters, Margaret Picotte of Florida and Anne Lindsay of Massachusetts; her son, John Jr. of Connecticut; and five grandchildren.         The demands of motherhood were soon joined by the rigors of campaigning as Mr. Lindsay won three terms as a congressman from the city's ''Silk Stocking District,'' serving from 1959 to 1965.         She described their days at Gracie Mansion as ''beginning with chaos, ending with chaos and with a slight climactic middle.''         The verbal skills of the slender, green-eyed woman were suggested by her answer when asked how she felt when her husband was described as ''the creator of all urban evil,'' by The Post in 1971. She at first snapped that people who criticized Mr. Lindsay were ignorant.         Mrs. Lindsay quickly recovered.         ''Goodness,'' she said, ''criticism is part of our heritage. It's an important feature of this country.''         Robert Price, who helped direct Mr. Lindsay's four congressional races and first mayoral campaign, once gave Mrs. Lindsay the ultimate politician's compliment. He called her ''a political force more powerful than patronage.''       
         Elise Asher, a painter and a poet who blended images and poetry in her work, died last Sunday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 92 and also had a studio and summer home in Provincetown, Mass.         The cause was complications from a broken hip she suffered three weeks earlier, her family said. She was the wife of Stanley Kunitz, a former poet laureate of the United States.         Ms. Asher was an artist whose work was shown and published for more than 50 years, starting with a one-woman show in 1953 and a collection of poetry in 1955.         A restrospective is scheduled for this September at the June Kelly Gallery in SoHo, and a final sampler of her verse pictures was published in 2000.         Ms. Asher has been called an abstractionist on natural themes. She rendered poetry -- hers and others', including that of Mr. Kunitz -- on canvas in oil or acrylics on plexiglass. Conversely, she translated objects into verse.         Mixing and layering media, her brush jotted words on canvas, joining them through color and calligraphy so that the poem lay splayed in a bouquet of color and symbol.         At times her word-illuminations made the viewer squint to decipher them.         She could be whimsical, evoking ancient landscapes as a backdrop for playful horses and mythical animals. Later, when infirmity made painting a chore, she also used pencil and ink, in small drawings and lithographs.         She was born in Chicago. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and graduated from the Simmons School of Social Work in Boston before moving to New York in 1947.         She started writing poetry at a young age and had it published in Partisan Review and other periodicals. A collection, ''The Meandering Absolute,'' came out in 1955.         She was married to the painter Nanno De Groot in 1949 and divorced in 1957. A year later she married Mr. Kunitz, whom she had met through painter friends. He survives her, along with her daughter, Dr. Babette Becker, of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Dr. Gretchen Kunitz, of Orinda, Calif.; three granddaughters; and three great-grandchildren.         Ms. Asher had her first show in 1953 at the Tanager Gallery in New York. Since then her work has entered private and more than a dozen public collections, including those of the National Academy of Sciences and the Corcoran Gallery. The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown held a retrospective in 2000.         In 1994 the Sheep Meadow Press published ''The Visionary Gleam: Texts and Transformation,'' a title suggested by a William Wordsworth ode to combine the sources of her art. It placed, side by side, color plates of her paintings and the poems that sparked her imagination.         Sheep Meadow also issued ''Night Train'' (2000), for which she re-edited a collection of own poetry. Both books remain in print.       
         Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of persuading her teenage son to kill her wealthy father in Utah because of what she considered his stinginess, died on Tuesday at a hospice in San Diego. She was 65.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Marilyn Reagan, her sister, said. Ms. Schreuder (pronounced SHROY-der) lived in San Diego.         The murder of Franklin Bradshaw in Salt Lake City on July 23, 1978, provoked intense news coverage and led to two books, two television miniseries and, as recently as this year, a documentary on Court TV.         ''True crime is the hottest game in town,'' J. Anthony Lukas wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the two books, both published in 1985. One was ''My Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal'' (Atheneum) by Jonathan Coleman; the other was ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder: A Family Album'' (Doubleday) by Shana Alexander.         ''This is 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty' come to life,'' Bill Wells, the director one of the miniseries, for CBS, said in an interview with The Times in 1986.         The crime indeed involved fascinating characters and plot twists. There was Ms. Schreuder, who bought $40,000 earrings at Tiffany's and sat on the board of the New York City Ballet. Mr. Bradshaw was one of the country's richest men and was known as Utah's Howard Hughes, but he bought his clothes at thrift shops and used a Coors beer carton as a briefcase.         Marc F. Schreuder, the grandson who shot Mr. Bradshaw in the back and head with a .357 Magnum, testified at his mother's trial that she had told him : ''Look, Marc, it is not really killing. It is the right thing to do for us.''         Frances Bernice Bradshaw was born on April 6, 1938, in Salt Lake City. She attended Bryn Mawr but was suspended in 1958 for stealing and forging checks and was told that she could return only if she received psychiatric help.         In the summer of 1958 she lived in Manhattan at the Barbizon Hotel for Women and met Vittorio Gentile, a pearl merchant, at Gino restaurant on Lexington Avenue. They married in 1959 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and in 1960 had two sons, Lorenzo in February and Marco in December.         After the couple divorced, the sons were called Larry and Marc. Larry, who has changed his last name to Bradshaw, now lives in Los Angeles. Marc Schreuder lives in Provo, Utah. In addition to Ms. Reagan, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Schreuder is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, to Frederik Schreuder. She is Lavinia Schreuder of San Diego.         Mr. Coleman, the author, said in an interview that Frances Schreuder was skilled at manipulating her mother to get money, even as her father tired of supporting her extravagant life in New York. Her $360,000 donation to the New York City Ballet was the largest lump-sum contribution in the company's history up to that time.         At the time, news reports said she made contributions to the ballet and other New York causes, but Ms. Reagan said in an interview yesterday that Mrs. Schreuder's mother, Berenice Bradshaw, actually made most of them.         Mr. Bradshaw made his fortune by starting a chain of auto parts stores and acquiring federal oil and gas leases. Ms. Schreuder came to believe she might be disinherited, and her simmering resentment blossomed into a murder plot that at one point involved hiring what turned out to be a bogus hit man for $5,000.         The summer before the killing, when her sons went to Salt Lake City to work in their grandfather's company, she gave them poison to put in his food, Mr. Coleman said.         After the murder, the police first suspected a transient. But a year later, the murder weapon surfaced in Manhattan, and the police traced Marc Schreuder's journey days before the killing, to Utah by way of Texas, where he bought the murder weapon.         Although Mrs. Bradshaw spent $2 million on the legal defense of Marc Schreuder and his mother, Marc Schreuder was convicted of second-degree murder in 1982 and served 12 years in prison. Ms. Schreuder was convicted of first-degree murder the next year and was imprisoned for 13 years.         Marc Schreuder testified against his mother, saying she must be stopped, according to Mr. Coleman's book. ''I'm doing this for Lavinia,'' he said of his sister. ''Someone should care about Lavinia.''         Ms. Schreuder, who earned two sociology degrees while in prison, worked briefly for the Marriott Corporation in Salt Lake City before moving to San Diego. She inherited a comfortable income from her mother, despite family members' efforts to invoke a statute barring convicted killers from inheriting anything from their victims. A judge ruled that the law did not govern Berenice Bradshaw's choice of heirs.         Correction:  April 10, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on April 1 about Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of having arranged the murder of her father in Utah, misstated the time elapsed before the murder weapon was found and referred incorrectly to the college work she completed in prison. The weapon, a handgun, was found two years after the murder, not one. She earned a degree in psychology, not two in sociology. The article also misstated the title of a book about the case by Jonathan Coleman. It is ''At Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal,'' not ''My Mother's Request.''       
         Estée Lauder, the last great independent titan of the cosmetics industry, who convinced generations of women that her beauty creams were ''jars of hope'' in their quest for the eternal look of youth, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her family, in announcing her death, said she was 97.         ''The pursuit of beauty is honorable,'' Mrs. Lauder used to say. And she clearly believed that the business of beauty was just as honorable. No one but a believer could have given so much of herself in becoming an internationally respected strategist in the age-old struggle against wrinkles, sags, bags and blemishes. Her weapons in that effort were creams, powders, ointments, potions and muds, many containing top-secret emollients. And if they didn't do the trick, she had an array of scents, equally secret in their constitution, that might befog man's vision of woman aging.         Her efforts resulted in the establishment of a company estimated to be worth about $5 billion when it went public in 1995 and she was given the title of founding chairwoman. In 2003, it had 21,500 employees and an estimated worth of about $10 billion. Its products are sold in more than 130 countries across five continents.         Estée Lauder Companies was not formally established until 1946 but its roots go back to the 1920's with facial creams concocted over a gas stove in a modest kitchen by Mrs. Lauder's uncle, John Schotz. It was nurtured financially and technically years later by Arnold L. van Ameringen, a Dutch-born industrialist. The company grew exponentially in the 1950's with the introduction of a bath oil called Youth-Dew, the creation of which is variously attributed to Mrs. Lauder and Mr. van Ameringen.         In the years after the start of her almost messianic crusade to give women the perennial bloom of youth, Mrs. Lauder marketed a variety of other beauty aids, among them Super-Rich All Purpose Creme, Cleaning Oil, Creme Pack and a skin lotion (all of them the creations of Dr. Schotz). In all, she marketed some 2,000 individual shades and items produced by five Lauder companies: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Prescriptives and (for men) Aramis. Among the fragrances she introduced were Estée (1968), Azuree (1969), Aliage (1972), Private Collection (1973), Beautiful (1985) and Pleasures (1995).         In 1995 the company also entered into a licensing agreement with the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to market Tommy, a line of fragrances, and with Make-Up Artists Cosmetics of Toronto to distribute its MAC products outside North America.         ''I love my product,'' Mrs. Lauder once said. ''I love to touch the creams, smell them, look at them, carry them with me. A person has to love her harvest if she's to expect others to love it.''         Mrs. Lauder also loved to touch her customers. During the period when she was building her business, she invariably showed up at stores where her products were being introduced and, with no provocation at all, whip out a jar and rub its contents on the wrist or face of a prospective customer so that her skin would acquire ''a gentle glow.''         She also understood the rewards that come from generosity and she was known in the industry for her free samples and particularly for the concept of ''gift with purchase.'' She introduced these creative marketing measures when her company was in its infancy and she was advised by an agency that the $50,000 she had available for advertising was not enough to have any effect.         Although she was protective toward those who trusted her to create effective products, she used stark candor to describe her competitors, all of them ferocious and all of whom she outlived by many years. She referred to Charles Revson as ''my arch and implacable enemy'' and she said that Elizabeth Arden was ''not a nice woman, not a generous woman.'' She said that Sam Rubin of Fabergé was ''patronizing even for those prefeminist days'' and that although Helena Rubenstein may have looked like a czarina, ''the skin on her neck was less than perfect.''         Perfection in the face of woman consumed Mrs. Lauder, and so did her desire to make a lot of money and leave the conditions of her childhood behind her. ''Someday, I will have whatever I want,'' she is said to have predicted many years ago. By the late 1980's, with personal assets of $233 million and a listing in Forbes's gallery of the 400 richest Americans, it was clear that she had made her prediction come true.         Although the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry led many women to believe that Estée Lauder was born in Europe to an aristocratic family, she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all. Josephine Esther Mentzer was born at home in Corona, Queens, on July 1, 1908, according to several biographies, although her family believes it may have been two years earlier. She was the daughter of Max Mentzer, a hardware man who was the proprietor of a hay and seed store, and Rose Schotz Rosenthal Mentzer, a woman who was much interested in beauty regimens.         The Mentzers were hard-working immigrants and Esther, destined to become known to the world by the diminutive of Estée, recalled well the Christmastime wrapping of gifts of hammers and nails, her father's gifts to his customers.         In her 1985 autobiography, ''Estée, A Success Story,'' Mrs. Lauder recalled her mother as ''a Hungarian beauty whose mother was a French Catholic and whose father was a Hungarian Jew.'' She described her father as ''an elegant, dapper monarchist in Europe, who, when transported to a new country, still carried a cane and gloves on Sundays.''         In interviews conducted over the years with various journalists, Mrs. Lauder said much that indicated her beginnings were quite genteel and comfortable. But Lee Israel, whose unauthorized biography, ''Estée Lauder, Beyond the Magic,'' was also published in 1985, maintained that the Lauder family's life in a working-class Italian neighborhood was much more modest than Mrs. Lauder would acknowledge.         Whatever her circumstances, there was no quarrel about the suggestion that as a young girl, Estée, a petite blonde, was known for her lovely skin and her determination to always look good. This determination was heightened when, as a student at Newtown High School in Queens, she became interested in the work of her uncle, John Schotz.         He had come to the United States from Hungary in 1900 with considerable training in chemistry. People referred to him as Dr. Schotz, although it is not clear that he had a doctorate. Whatever his background, he created a number of beauty products, including Six-in-One Cold Cream, Dr. Schotz Viennese Cream and a number of fragrances.         But the New Way Laboratory, which he created in 1924, was hardly limited to the needs of the beautiful people. It also produced a poultry-lice killer, a cure for mange, suppositories, a cream that was touted as promoting the building of muscles, a freckle remover and even embalming fluid. Years later, a chemist for Revlon said that although Dr. Schotz's beauty-care products were heavy and ''very old fashioned,'' they were good for their time and effective, especially for dry skin. One of the Schotz products even contained a primitive form of sunscreen.         Estée studied his homemade products closely and, since Dr. Schotz was no businessman, helped him to sell them. Estée said little about her past and it is not clear that she even graduated from Newtown High. But in school or out, she remained fascinated with his beauty aids and was still promoting them in 1930 when she married Joseph Lauter, whom she had been dating for about three years. He was the son of William and Lillian Lauter, who had come to the United States from the part of Austria known as Galicia. Mr. Lauter had tried his hand without much success in both the silk and button businesses. The name was changed to ''Lauder'' later in the decade.         Their marriage foundered and they were divorced in 1939. Their separation lasted until 1942, when Estée told her friends that Mr. Lauder was a very nice man and that ''I don't know why I broke off with him.'' They remarried that December and remained together until his death in 1982.         She is survived by her sons, Leonard A., the chairman of the company, and Ronald S., chairman of Clinique Laboratories; four grandchildren, including William, who will become chief executive of the Estée Lauder Companies on July 1; and six great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Lauder and her husband were apart she met and became close to Mr. van Ameringen, who became president and chairman of International Flavors and Fragrances, a company that formulates fragrances for many well-known beauty houses and has no connection with the Lauder empire. They became lifelong friends and Mr. van Ameringen provided both credit and, some said, product formula for the firm that would bear Mrs. Lauder's name. From the beginning, she was its chief executive and made its most important marketing and product development decisions.         In 1944, the Lauders opened concessions in beauty salons in New York and sold products to out-of-town salons through jobbers. Leonard Lauder, who became president of the company in the 1970's, recalled that ''we had a Boston wholesaler, the Samuel Bernstein Hair Company, and Mr. Bernstein used to talk to me about his son Lenny.''         Mrs. Lauder would go on the road, trying to induce finer stores to feature her merchandise. ''I have the secrets,'' she would tell prospective clients. ''Start the New Year with a new face.''         The concessions were closed in 1946 and gradually the company sold to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. That helped to give her products the prestigious aura they needed for more aggressive marketing.         The introduction of Youth-Dew and Mrs. Lauder's sales expertise combined to take the company from a sales volume of no more than $400 a week to around $5,000 in the early 1950's. It still had no sales staff as such, but it was gaining an image of quality from the department stores in which it was displayed. By 1958, when Leonard joined the company, sales had soared to about $800,000 a year.         The company began to grow more rapidly. In 1965, Mrs. Lauder opened her first beauty ''spa'' in Bloomingdale's New York store. She planned her counters personally and determined that each ''would be a tiny, shining spa -- complete.''         ''I'd make sure the color I chose was the same wonderful 'in between a blue and a green' that whispered elegance, aristocracy, and also complemented bathroom wallpapers,'' she said.         By this time, Estée Lauder was well on her way to becoming the doyenne of beauty and her list of friends began to reflect her regal image. The Duchess of Windsor had long been a friend and now there were others. Princess Grace of Monaco sent her Christmas cards and visited her in New York. Many socially prominent people invited her to their parties, among them the Begum Aga Khan, C. Z. Guest, Nancy Reagan and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. In January 1978, when she received the Legion of Honor, it did not seem to bother the French that Estée Lauder's fragrances were outselling Chanel's by 3 to 1. Gerard Gaussen, the consul general of France, said that she ''represents what we French admire most about Americans -- brains and heart.''         Mrs. Lauder was a generous contributor to civic causes and charities. The Lauder Foundation was set up in the 1960's and it has, among other things, set up three playgrounds in Central Park. The Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies was founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.         It was probably inevitable that such a woman would have her detractors, too. Some said Mrs. Lauder had never adequately compensated John Schotz, who died in the 1960's in modest circumstances at a time when Estée Lauder Inc. was grossing around $14 million a year. Others, according to her biographer, Lee Israel, complained that she denied or played down her Jewishness (Ms. Israel said that Mrs. Lauder told one interviewer that she was half Italian and convent-bred), that she was a name-dropper, a social climber, and not entirely loyal. Ms. Israel quotes an ex-secretary to the duchess of Windsor as complaining that after the duke died and the duchess became infirm, Mrs. Lauder ''deserted'' her.         Unperturbed by the naysayers, Mrs. Lauder lived life vigorously, taking from it what she wanted and rejecting things that would take her away from the people and places she knew. Thus, she rejected President Nixon's offer to make her ambassador to Luxembourg (she blamed her husband, who reportedly said, ''I'm not going to carry her bags'').         In 1982, she demonstrated her approach to life. When she felt that her ruby and diamond tiara clashed horribly with her turquoise dress, she immediately switched to a more suitable gold and diamond crown. ''You know how it is,'' she told Charlotte Curtis of The New York Times. ''You have to wear something.''       
         Rosemary Park Anastos, an advocate for women's education and the liberal arts and a former president of Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women, died April 17 at her home in Los Angeles, said a niece, Joan Citron. She was 97.         Dr. Park, as she was known professionally, came from a family of academics: her mother was a teacher, her father and brother were also college presidents. When she left the Barnard presidency in 1967 after five years, she became the first woman to be a vice chancellor at the University of California. At her Barnard inauguration in 1963, she said that ''to avoid becoming a nursery school to the university with custodial and elementary responsibilities only,'' the college must make its liberal arts more sophisticated. She said that meant moving beyond acquiring facts to the mastery of subjects like advanced mathematics, political and economic theory and classical philosophy.         At Connecticut, where she was president from 1947 to 1962, she expanded the student body by one-third, strengthened the curriculum, built major new buildings and was a tireless fund-raiser. She made the campus a national center for modern dance and generally enhanced the college's reputation. When Yale gave her an honorary degree in 1958, it said she had been a major force in ''adding a bright star to the galaxy of liberal arts colleges for women.''         At Barnard, she followed a similar agenda, strengthening the curriculum, adding major buildings and raising money. But she left after five years, pulled by her marriage in 1965 to Milton Vasil Anastos, a professor of Byzantine Greek at the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in 1997. Dr. Park is survived by her stepson, Milton V. Anastos Jr., of Warwick, R.I., and several nieces and nephews.         Of her departure for California, David Truman, dean of Columbia College, wrote in Barnard's alumnae magazine that although she was the only woman at many Columbia meetings, her wisdom and humor gave weight to her advice and made her ''one of the best men in the university.''         Not all of her dealings with Columbia were harmonious, however, as she related in an interview with Helen S. Astin, a U.C.L.A. colleague, in ''The Higher Education of Women: Essays in Honor of Rosemary Park.'' When she proposed a new science laboratory for Barnard, she said, Columbia discouraged her, saying its labs were sufficient. But, she said, Barnard did not control those labs, and the absence of its own lab would send a signal ''that it didn't believe in science for women.'' Barnard built a new lab.         Born in Andover, Mass., Dr. Park was the oldest of four children of J. Edgar Park, a minister raised in Ireland who became president of Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, and Grace Burtt Park, who taught Greek and mathematics. Her brother, William E. Park, was president of Simmons College, in Boston.         She studied German at Radcliffe and graduated summa cum laude. She later studied at the University of Bonn in 1930 and in 1934 earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cologne. She began teaching German part time, first at Wheaton, then at Connecticut College, where she became dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, then president.         She spoke and wrote widely on education, the role of women and other topics, often breaking from conventional wisdom. She told parents that they should encourage their children to take courses in advanced mathematics and French, because society would need scientists and linguists. She said that schools facing teacher shortages should think about using television and older students to help with the teaching; both, she said, had proved effective.         She often leavened her seriousness with wit. In one speech, she took a swipe at English usage: ''At some point in most of the professions, the regrettable expression 'load' arose: case load, patient load, teaching load,'' she said. ''Artists, as far as I know, do not refer to picture load, poem load or concert load.''         Although she supported women's education, she was not a zealot. In her interview with Dr. Astin, Dr. Park said that women's colleges were ''particularly important for girls who develop slowly,'' but said men might benefit ''from the same kind of protective environment.'' She predicted that women's colleges would become less necessary, and she won authority to establish Connecticut College for Men and then admitted men as graduate students.         She was an energetic fund-raiser at a time when it was not always viewed as dignified. To raise $3.1 million for Connecticut College, she crossed the country, meeting with executives who questioned the need to finance women's education.         She became a vice chancellor at U.C.L.A. in 1967, and then a professor. In 1980, she helped develop the Plato Society, a U.C.L.A. study program for retired people. Until a few months ago, she was a member herself, taking courses like ''Romantic Composers'' and ''Brain and Memory.''       
         Joan Richman, a retired executive at CBS News who oversaw the network's early coverage of the Apollo space program with Walter Cronkite, died on Friday at her home in Lumberville, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, Kyle Good, a family friend, said.         A native of St. Louis, Ms. Richman graduated from Wellesley College in 1961.         She was hired the same year to clip newspapers in the research library of CBS News. By 1965, she was a researcher in the special events unit, and in 1968, she became a full producer. She went on to win two Emmy awards for producing Mr. Cronkite's space coverage, one in 1971 for the Apollo 13 and 14 missions, and another, in 1972, for the Apollo 15 mission.         In a statement released by Ms. Richman's family, Mr. Cronkite said that she ''was probably more important than any other individual in shaping the presentation of a new science that gripped the world's imagination.''         From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Richman worked as senior producer for ''The Reasoner Report'' for ABC News, before returning to CBS.         Ms. Richman became executive producer of the weekend editions of the CBS Evening News in 1976, while also producing special events coverage, including the election-night specials in 1976, 1978 and 1980.         In 1981, she was promoted to vice president and director for special events at CBS News, overseeing special coverage of breaking news.         She built her career at CBS News during a time when it was rare for a woman to be a senior media executive. ''It's difficult for the many women thriving in broadcast journalism today to imagine the battles Joan Richman fought and won on their behalf,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, in the statement from the family.         She retired in 1989 to teach at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         She is survived by her sister, Judith R. Saidel of Albany; two nephews, Andrew, of Gaithersburg, Md., and Jonathan, of Albany; a niece, Lisa Saidel, also of Albany; and three grandnieces.       
         Mildred Jeffrey, who for seven decades was an influential behind-the-scenes combatant in the women's, labor and civil rights movements, died on March 24 in Detroit. She was 93.         Her death was announced by the United Automobile Workers union, where she was the first woman to head a department, becoming director of its Women's Bureau in 1944. She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus and was the unofficial head of a group of women who helped persuade Walter F. Mondale to name Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate on the 1984 Democratic ticket.         As a student at the University of Minnesota in the early 1930's, she and an African-American classmate helped integrate restaurants in Minneapolis. Decades later, she marched in the South with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.         In 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.         Mildred McWilliams, known as Millie, was born on Dec. 29, 1910, in Alton, Iowa, the eldest of seven children. Her grandmother, a widow, ran a farm and raised 16 children by herself. Her mother, who was the first woman to become a registered pharmacist in Iowa, in 1908, raised seven children on her own after her husband left the family.         In 1932, Ms. Jeffrey received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Minnesota, where she immersed herself in the socialist and progressive movements. In 1934, she received a master's degree in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr.         With the passage of laws promoting labor unions, she became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Philadelphia and later the education director of the Pennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers.         In 1936, she married another Amalgamated organizer, Homer Newman Jeffrey. They organized workers in the South and the East, taking mill jobs and rushing to unionize factories before management fired them for their activism. They divorced in the late 1950's.         During World War II, they moved to Washington and became consultants to the War Labor Board. There, they became close to Walter and Victor Reuther, the U.A.W. leaders.         In 1944, she moved to Detroit when the Reuthers offered her the job as head of the union's new Women's Bureau. She organized the U.A.W.'s first women's conference when a flood of returning veterans resulted in the large-scale postwar layoffs of women from factory jobs.         From 1949 to 1954 she ran the union's radio station. She also became director of its community relations department, aligning the union behind many civil rights efforts, and from 1968 to 1976, the year she retired, she headed the union's consumer affairs department.         Throughout her years at the union, she was active organizing, canvassing and raising money for the Democratic Party and civil rights efforts.         After helping create the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971, she became a leader on the Democratic Party committee that ensured that half the delegates to its 1980 convention were women. She helped propel the careers of many women in politics, including the governor of Michigan, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat.         Patricia Schroeder, a former United States representative from Colorado, said, ''Millie is the political godmother for many of us.''         Ms. Jeffrey ran for only one office, when she was elected in Michigan to the board of governors of Wayne State University in Detroit. She served on the board for 16 years, including three years as its chairwoman.         She played a major role in many groups, including the Coalition of Labor Union Women, Emily's List, Americans for Democratic Action, the National Abortion Rights League and the American Civil Liberties Union.         She is survived by a daughter, Sharon Lehrer of San Rafael, Calif.; a son, Balfour, of Missoula, Mont.; three sisters, Arlene Swain of St. Paul, Dorothy Shabel of St. Louis and Marjorie Lapic of Seattle; and two grandchildren.         Three years ago, Ms. Jeffrey told a University of Minnesota magazine: ''My underlying goal was always to empower women. Get them to learn their rights, and to exercise them!''       
         Timi Yuro, the pop singer whose throaty and soulful delivery made ''Hurt'' and other songs hits in the early 1960's, died on March 30 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said her niece, Michelle Duval.         Ms. Yuro's hits, like ''I Apologize,'' ''For the Love of a Boy'' and ''What's a Matter Baby (Is It Hurting You),'' featured her husky alto rising to dramatic climaxes above gentle orchestral accompaniment.         Her songs had the sentimentality of teenage pop, but in her vocals Ms. Yuro borrowed the bluesy intensity of black jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson.         Ms. Yuro began her career with ''Hurt,'' which reached the Top 10 in 1961, and it remained her signature song. Though recorded when she was barely out of her teens, she sang it with a strength and finesse that earned her a reputation as a soul powerhouse; her voice was often mistaken for that of a black woman or a man.         Born Rosemary Timotea Aurro in Chicago, she moved to Los Angeles as a child and began singing in her family's Italian restaurant. She signed with Liberty Records in 1959 and recorded ''Hurt'' with Clyde Otis, who had been a producer for Dinah Washington. The song, which had first been an R & B hit for Roy Hamilton in 1953, was later sung by Elvis Presley and Juice Newton.         Ms. Yuro had a string of hits with Liberty until she left the label in 1964, when she began recording with Mercury and other companies. She quit in the 1970's and her attempts to return to music in the early 80's were stymied by throat cancer.         She is survived by her husband, Robert Selnick, of Las Vegas, from whom she had separated; a daughter, Milan Reinoehl; a brother, Anthony; and three grandchildren.       
         Mary McGrory, an unapologetic liberal who chronicled 50 years of scandal, war, Congressional turmoil and political heartbreak as a columnist for The Washington Star and The Washington Post, died on Wednesday at George Washington University Hospital. She was 85.         Ms. McGrory won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1975 for her columns on Watergate. But her career had a remarkable range, from the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, where she first made her name, to the Bush administration and the war with Iraq, which she opposed in her final foreboding columns in March 2003. She suffered a stroke that month and did not return to her column. She had been in declining health ever since, said her nephew, Ted McGrory.         The daughter of a scholarly Boston postal clerk, Ms. McGrory was raised on Latin, poetry and a profoundly Irish love of the game of politics. She covered virtually every presidential campaign since 1956, drawn to their ''endless possibility,'' she once said. Her columns captured some of the greatest political characters of the era -- their loyalty, treachery, weaknesses, sacrifices, high causes and low moments.         She wrote a series of columns about the assassination and funeral of President John F. Kennedy that became one of the most evocative and enduring eulogies for the man and the times.         ''He was just home from the Pacific when I first saw him in 1946,'' she wrote. ''He was thin as a match and still yellow from malaria. But he was blithe and determined and wherever he went he was surrounded by young men who felt with him that the Irish had something more to give to American political life than a last hurrah.''         She was at the airport when Kennedy's body was flown back from Dallas, and she described the tearful, ''leaderless men of the New Frontier'' as they ''picked up their inexpressible burden'' of the young president's coffin. She then wrote a powerfully spare account of his funeral:         ''His old friend, Cardinal Cushing of Boston, who married him, baptized his children and prayed over him in the icy air of his inaugural, said a Low Mass. At the final prayers, after the last blessing, he suddenly added, 'dear Jack.' ''         Across the generations, Ms. McGrory was a fixture on Capitol Hill, summoning House members off the floor for a chat in the speaker's lobby, showing up every Tuesday to grab senators after their weekly party caucuses. She called Congress the ''federal entertainment center,'' and said she vastly preferred it to covering the White House, where ''there are all those courtiers,'' ''so full of themselves,'' who ''may or may not call you back.''         She wrote a column steeped in reporting at a time when other columnists increasingly focused on attitude, analysis and television appearances, and she did her own legwork well into her 80's.         ''I can't do it any other way,'' Ms. McGrory once said. ''I have to see, I have to hear. I'm primitive, I guess. I don't want anyone else doing my listening or watching for me.''         Her second cousin Brian McGrory, a columnist with The Boston Globe, recalled, ''She was hellbent on making sure every column was reported, hellbent on being out on the campaign trail, even when physically it wasn't the easiest thing for her.''         Nothing made her happier, Mr. McGrory added, than being in the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer outside Manchester, N.H., when it functioned as a roiling intelligence center for politicians and journalists covering the New Hampshire primary.         Ms. McGrory was a ground-breaking woman in American newspapers, often the only woman or one of a very few on the campaign trail in her early days. But she played down the notion that this was always, necessarily, a hardship. A woman who increasingly acquired the manner of an aging countess, as her friend Phil Gailey, editor of editorials at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida put it, she was legendary on the campaign trail for enlisting male reporters as her porters.         In his memoir ''A Good Life,'' Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, wrote: ''In the 60's I had been allowed to carry her bags and typewriter during the presidential campaign. We were known as McGrory's bearers.'' Several generations of bearers followed after him.         Her path to political reporting was not easy. A graduate of Boston's elite Girls' Latin School and Emmanuel College, Ms. McGrory got her start as secretary to the book editor of The Boston Herald Traveler. She also wrote book reviews and the kind of features she called ''dog stories,'' but she was ''crazy'' about newspapering and felt stymied, Ms. McGrory said in an oral history for the Washington Press Club Foundation.         She moved to The Washington Star as a book reviewer in 1947. She got her big break in 1954, when her editor, Newbold Noyes, sent her to Capitol Hill to cover the Army-McCarthy hearings. He urged her to write her stories as if she were writing a letter to a favorite aunt. She thought of her Aunt Sarah, ''a very nice, lonely person in our family,'' she said later, and a genre was born. She viewed Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, she said, as ''an Irish bully,'' a type she had seen before.         ''For eight days,'' she wrote in an early column, ''the Army secretary has been having his honesty questioned, his motives impugned and his patriotism challenged. He has been bullied, baited and patronized. He has been treated like a stubborn and not very bright child. Throughout his ordeal, moreover, he has been subjected to the rather jostling familiarity of Senator McCarthy, who calls him 'Bob.' ''         Ms. McGrory went on to cover all the classic Congressional dramas, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. ''Nothing that Bill Clinton did in the matter of Monica Lewinsky shows any class or character,'' she wrote, but added: ''The Republicans are beyond reason. They are like people on New Year's Eve, determined to have a wild time, no matter the cost.''         She was intensely loyal to The Star, and while The Washington Post tried to woo her many times over the years, she did not make the move until The Star closed in 1981. Post editors often joked they were always second best to Ms. McGrory.         In 1998, when accepting the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award, Ms. McGrory described her view of a Mary McGrory column. ''No great men call me,'' she said, proudly. ''You know who calls me? Losers. I am their mark.'' She added, ''If you want to abolish land mines. If you want to reform campaign spending'' or ''if you want to save children from abuse, or stupid laws, or thickheaded judges, you have my telephone number.''         ''All the places of little hope, that's my constituency,'' she said.         The Vietnam War was her great passion, and it framed her coverage of the 1968 presidential campaign, particularly the insurgent antiwar candidacy of Eugene J. McCarthy. But she ranged widely, with judgments that were often withering. Senator Edward M. Kennedy said ruefully, ''As Bobby once said, 'Mary is so gentle until she gets behind a typewriter.' ''         In a column about Richard M. Nixon's 1962 news conference after he lost the California governor's race, Ms. McGrory wrote: ''For Richard M. Nixon, it was exit snarling.'' She later made the Nixon administration's famous enemies list.         Ms. McGrory did not marry or have children, but had a large extended family, including two nieces, in addition to her nephew; a loyal group of Washington Star veterans; and a longtime relationship as the ultimate volunteer with St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home.         She was also a hostess of some renown. Mr. Gailey remembers one McGrory party in 1982, a christening for his son, that featured Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. singing, ''If you're Irish, come into the parlor,'' while a Reagan White House aide, Michael K. Deaver, accompanied him on the piano.         When she accepted her press club award in 1998, Ms. McGrory declared, ''I should confess that I always felt a little sorry for people who didn't work for newspapers.''       
         Muriel Mallin Berman, a Pennsylvania arts patron and philanthropist, died on April 13 at her home in Allentown, Pa. She was 89.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Berman, an optometrist by profession, and her husband, Philip, were benefactors of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, among other institutions. She was an honorary board member and served on committees concerned with contemporary art, prints and drawings.         The Bermans helped endow the museum's curatorship of 20th-century art. Their gifts let it acquire thousands of old master drawings and 19th-century and old master prints, and the museum named its prints and drawings gallery in their honor.         Their other beneficiaries included cultural, educational and medical institutions in eastern Pennsylvania, the American Jewish Committee, the Jewish Publication Society, and the Hadassah Medical Organization and Hebrew University in Jerusalem.         They established the Philip and Muriel Berman Center for Jewish Studies at Lehigh University, and the Center for Biblical Archaeology at Hebrew University. Paintings from their personal collection toured the world via the Art in the U.S Embassies Program.         In the past, Mrs. Berman was a Unicef delegate to international conferences. She was a United States representative at the United Nations International Women's Year Conference in Mexico City in 1975.         She was born Muriel Mallin in Pittsburgh, studied at the University of Pittsburgh and what is now Carnegie Mellon University, and graduated from the Pennsylvania College of Optometry. She practiced as her husband built his fortune in trucking and heavy equipment, keeping her optometrist's license into the 1980's.         She also took part as a corporate officer in Mr. Berman's growing business, which later included the Hess's department store chain. Philip I. Berman died in 1997 after 55 years of marriage.         She is survived by two daughters, Nancy Berman of Los Angeles and Nina B. Schafer of Unionville, Pa.; a son, Steven M. of Mill Valley, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Kamala Markandaya, the novelist who helped forge the image of India for American readers in schools and book clubs from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on May 16 at her home in London. She was 79.         The cause was kidney failure, said Kim Oliver, her daughter and only immediate survivor.         Ms. Markandaya is best known for her first book, ''Nectar in a Sieve,'' which introduced millions of readers to rural life in an industrialized India through the eyes a peasant woman named Rukmani.         ''Most Americans' perception of India came through Kamala Markandaya,'' said Charles Larson, chairman of the department of literature at American University in Washington.         ''Nectar in a Sieve'' was a best seller and the main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club in March 1955, earning Ms. Markandaya a $100,000 prize. She published nine other novels, including ''A Handful of Rice'' in 1966 and ''The Nowhere Man'' in 1972.         The dominant theme of Ms. Markandaya's work is the intersection of rural and urban life in India and the unrealized dreams of peasants seeking their fortunes in the factory.         Ms. Markandaya wrote under a pseudonym. She was born Kamala Purnaiya in 1924 in Mysore, in Southern India. Her family was Brahmin, the highest Hindu caste. She studied history at the University of Madras and worked as a journalist. In 1948 she moved to London, where she met her husband, Bertrand Taylor, who died in 1986.         Ms. Markandaya wrote in London, but made frequent trips back to India.         Later in her career she struggled to find a publisher as a cluster of new writers, including Amitav Ghosh and Salman Rushdie, emerged in the 1980's and redefined Indian literature, pushing it toward a magical realism that captivated the American audience.         Referring to Mr. Rushdie's 1981 novel, Mr. Larson said, ''Once 'Midnight's Children' got out there, the more traditional realistic novel wasn't very popular anymore.''       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Virginia Capers, an actress and singer who won a Tony Award in 1974 for her role in ''Raisin,'' the musical version of ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' died on Thursday in Los Angeles. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         She died after a bout of pneumonia, said her son, Glenn Capers.         Ms. Capers was an experienced but little-known character actress when she was cast as Lena Younger, the matriarch of the struggling working-class black family in ''Raisin,'' a musical that opened in the fall of 1973, based on Lorraine Hansberry's play. But Ms. Capers's intense stage presence captivated critics. In his review for The New York Times, Clive Barnes called her ''a vast and loving Gibraltar of a woman'' and said she was ''tremendous in just about every sense you can use the word.''         Ms. Capers won the Tony for best actress in a musical. The show, which also starred Deborah Allen, Ernestine Jackson and Joe Morton, was nominated for nine Tonys, and also won for best musical. It ran on Broadway for more than two years and had a long life as a touring show.         Eliza Virginia Capers was born in Sumter, S.C., and attended Howard University and the Juilliard School. She began performing in Yiddish theater and by the late 1950's had made her way to Broadway. She was an understudy for Adelaide Hall in ''Jamaica,'' which opened in 1957, and in 1959 she was in the cast of ''Saratoga,'' the Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer musical.         Before ''Raisin,'' Ms. Capers worked extensively in television and in the movies, appearing on ''The Untouchables,'' ''Have Gun, Will Travel,'' ''Mannix'' and ''Dragnet,'' among many other shows. In the 1972 film ''Lady Sings the Blues,'' she played the mother to Diana Ross's Billie Holiday, and she was also in ''Trouble Man'' and ''The Lost Man.'' After ''Raisin,'' she appeared on the television shows ''Frank's Place,'' ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' and ''The Hughleys.''         Besides her son, of Los Angeles, she is survived by a brother, James H. Capers, of New York.       
         Dorothy Van Engle, a 1930's star of several films of the pioneer black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, died here on Monday, her family said. She was 87 and had recently moved to Ocala from her longtime home in Port Charlotte, Fla.         Known for her beauty and cool sophistication, Ms. Van Engle was a favorite of African-American audiences of her era. Among her most notable films were Micheaux's ''Swing'' (1938), ''Murder in Harlem'' (1935) and ''Harlem After Midnight'' (1934).         She left the movies around 1940, at the height of her career, to marry and start a family.         From the 1920's until mid-century, there was a vital industry of movies made by black filmmakers for black audiences. At the time, these were virtually the only films in which black characters were given leading roles. Micheaux was one of the key figures of this African-American cinema as both producer and director. He used all-black casts and crews, but was sometimes criticized for stereotypical portrayals of his characters.         Ms. Van Engle's real name was Donessa Dorothy Hollon. She grew up in Harlem with connections to show business, her cousin Edna Turner-DeGeneste said. A relative whose husband played with Cab Calloway's band introduced her to Micheaux.         An accomplished seamstress, Ms. Van Engle made her own costumes for her films, Ms. Turner-DeGeneste said.         After leaving the movies, she never looked back on her career in show business, her cousin added. She worked for the library system in Port Charlotte until four years ago.         Ms. Van Engle is survived by her children Herbert H. Hollon of Zarra, Spain, and Marc S. Hollon of Aurora, Ontario; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Brenda Fassie, the wild child of South African pop who was beloved as the piercing siren of the dispossessed under apartheid, died on May 9. She was 39.         Family members said that her death stemmed from an April 26 asthma attack at home that led to heart failure and brain damage. She had been on life support since then at the Sunninghill Hospital north of Johannesburg.         For 20 years, singing in English, Xhosa and Zulu, Ms. Fassie was one of Africa's top-selling musicians and the object of some of its liveliest gossip.         ''Black President,'' her anthem to Nelson Mandela in jail envisioning the day that he would come out and lead the country, became her generation's harder-edged addition to its elders' tradition of religious liberation songs.         ''Vulindlela,'' her wedding song, was adopted by the African National Congress in its 1999 election campaign. ''Weekend Special,'' her complaint that she would not be a married man's part-time girlfriend, topped the charts before she was 20 and remained a staple.         Ms. Fassie's tempestuous life and her changing fashions in music and clothing earned her the nickname ''the black Madonna of the townships,'' but she was far less solvent and far more impetuous than the American Madonna.         She struggled for years with drug and alcohol problems, hitting bottom in 1995 when she woke up in a seedy Johannesburg hotel next to the body of her lesbian lover, who had overdosed. She went into rehabilitation, but was defiant in interviews about her crack use and her bisexuality, then largely taboo subjects among black South Africans.         She was often broke, sharing her large houses with her singers, musicians and hangers-on and helping support her siblings. She missed concerts, leading her fans to riot and her producers to sue. Even when she was famous, her son, Bongani, now 20, was asked to leave his grammar school when she could not pay tuition. He is her only survivor.         She had a series of stormy relationships with men and women, many of which ended in a hurricane of newspaper articles with accusations from one side or the other of beatings, theft or drug binges. She fired and then reunited with various managers, and alienated critics by hurling obscenities at them during awards ceremonies. And yet through it all, the nation looked on her with indulgent affection.         She could call herself the niece of former President Mandela (she was a member of the same Madiba clan of the Xhosas) and refer to him as a ''bloody jailbird'' in the same sentence and still be forgiven. (He, his former wife Winnie and President Thabo Mbeki all visited her in the hospital before her death.)         Recently, after a string of South African music awards, she boasted: ''I'm going to become the pope next year. Nothing is impossible.''         Ms. Fassie, who was named for the American singer Brenda Lee, grew up in a two-bedroom house in Langa, a black township outside Cape Town. The last of nine children of a domestic worker, she sang as a child at churches and hospitals, and then in high school she joined a group that performed in colored townships, which was unusual in those days when apartheid segregated the races on a hierarchical ladder and mixed-race audiences rarely accepted African singers.         She described running away from home at 14 and hitchhiking on a gasoline truck to the Soweto township outside Johannesburg. Other accounts said she went in an agent's car with her mother's permission. In any case her talent was soon recognized, and she was asked to front a group that then changed its name to Brenda and the Big Dudes.         After their initial hits, she went off on her own, and the Dudes named their next album ''Hamba Uzobuya'' (''Yeah, Go, but You'll Come Back''). She did not. The Dudes disbanded. Her career took off.       
         Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, a self-trained South African naturalist who in 1938 discovered the coelacanth, a species of bony, four-finned fish often described as a living fossil, died on May 17 in East London, South Africa. She was 97.         A cause of death was not determined, although she had suffered a series of falls, said Susan L. Jewett, a researcher for the Smithsonian Institution who recently visited her.         The story of Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's discovery remains among the most famous in the annals of modern biology. She was a young curator at the East London Museum when, on Dec. 22, 1938, she spotted the coelacanth in a pile of fish on a vessel at the town's dock. After taking steps to preserve the 127-pound fish, she sent a quick sketch to South Africa's leading fish expert, Dr. J.L.B. Smith of Rhodes University.         ''With that action, Courtenay-Latimer became the point person and den mother for all who were to study the fish,'' said Dr. Keith S. Thomson, professor emeritus of natural history at Oxford University and author of the book ''Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth'' (1991).         Dr. Thomson compared the discovery to finding a lost dinosaur on a South American plateau or a pterodactyl in the Everglades. Before Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's discovery, the coelacanth was thought to have been extinct for at least 70 million years.         As a living species, it is believed to hold a unique place in the evolutionary chain from fish to land vertebrates. Early theories that held that the fish might be a direct ancestor of humankind were disproved by studies in the 1980's of the coelacanth's anatomy and DNA.         ''We continually ask, how can this fish have evolved so little?'' Dr. Thomson said.         Recalling her discovery, Ms. Courtenay-Latimer later wrote: ''I saw a blue fin and, pushing off the fish, the most beautiful fish I had ever seen was revealed. It was five feet long and a pale mauve blue with iridescent silver markings.'' She added, ''This I will definitely take to the museum.''         The second coelacanth was caught 14 years later, in 1952, in the Indian Ocean off the Comoro Islands after an international effort by Dr. Smith to find more specimens of the fish. Some 200 coelacanths have been captured since, leading to a call to study the fish in its environment and to preserve the species. Several were found off the South African coast last month.         The significance of the coelacanth continues to unfold.         Dr. William E. Bemis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said studies of the fish's eye muscles, used to close its jaws, had provided important links to how similar muscles in frogs and vertebrates worked. Other studies have shown that the fish possesses within its snout an electrosensory organ, the rostral organ, which scientists have determined is probably used to find prey.         Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer was born Feb. 24, 1907, the daughter of a railroad accountant who moved the family to stations throughout South Africa. While still a child, she began a collection of bird eggs and insects. She was educated at a convent school and intended to train as a nurse, but became curator at the East London Museum in 1931, a position she held until 1973. She never married.         Although best known for her discovery of the coelacanth, Ms. Courtenay-Latimer had a broader interest in natural history, and also wrote about wildflowers.         In 1971, she received an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University. In 1998, she was a guest of honor when the South African government unveiled a gold coin minted to commemorate the coelacanth's discovery. Ms. Courtenay-Latimer's scientific collaborator, Dr. Smith, named the species after her, Latimeria chalumnae.         Ms. Courtenay-Latimer is survived by two nieces and a nephew.       
         Irene Manning, a lyric soprano and actress who charmed audiences with her performances in 1940's musical films like ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' ''Shine On, Harvest Moon'' and ''The Desert Song,'' died on May 28 at her home in San Carlos, Calif. She was 91.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her stepdaughter Peggy H. Schafer of Pleasanton, Calif.         Trained as a classical singer, Ms. Manning had a fleeting but stellar career as a leading lady. She appeared glamorously in westerns, on Broadway and the London stage and entertained wounded soldiers in World War II.         Still billed as Hope Manning, she made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''Susanna, Don't You Cry,'' a bouquet of Stephen Foster songs arranged into a musical for the American Lyric Theater at the Martin Beck. The show soon closed, but she received good reviews, and Warner Brothers signed her for ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' a blockbuster musical of 1942 with James Cagney as the producer and songwriter George M. Cohan. Ms. Manning portrayed the diva Fay Templeton and sang ''Mary Is a Grand Old Name'' and ''So Long, Mary.'' Because the movie is a perennial on television, it is probably her most famous film role.         She played opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Big Shot,'' a hard-boiled gangster movie of 1943, and in a version of ''The Desert Song'' also in 1943, with Dennis Morgan. She appeared the next year in ''Shine On, Harvest Moon'' and ''Make Your Own Bed'' and made two forgettable war pictures before returning to Broadway in 1945 for ''The Day Before Spring,'' an original Lerner-Loewe caper about a class reunion, with ballets by Antony Tudor.         During the war, she had led a four-women U.S.O. troupe touring for the Air Force and performing at hospitals throughout Britain. She also recorded four songs, in German, with Glenn Miller's orchestra just before he died in a plane crash in 1944, including ''Begin the Beguine'' and ''All the Things You Are.''         Ms. Manning was born Inez Harvout into a musical family in Cincinnati; both her parents were singers. She trained at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and seemed headed for the opera stage.         Her first movie was ''The Old Corral'' (1936), starring Gene Autry, and she was in at least two more westerns before her Broadway debut.         After the war she returned to England for a time to work onstage and had a BBC television show, ''An American in England.'' In the 1950's she toured in America and appeared in regional theaters and on television, notably with Cyril Ritchard in ''The King and Mrs. Candle'' (1955). She had the lead in ''The Tattoed Princess,'' a 1961 musical at the Barbizon Plaza Theater in Manhattan in 1961.         She taught voice and acting into the mid-1990's but performed only occasionally.         In 1964 Ms. Manning married Maxwell White Hunter II, a rocket engineer and space-flight manager, with whom she lived in San Carlos until his death, in 2001.         In addition to Ms. Schafer, Ms. Manning is survived by another stepdaughter, Sally H. Wiley of Evanston, Ill.; three stepsons, Matthew S. Hunter of Los Angeles; Maxwell Hunter III and David M. Hunter, both of Holidaysburg, Pa.; and five grandchildren.         Correction:  June 12, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on Thursday about Irene Manning, a singing film actress of the 1940's, misstated the name of an Off Broadway musical in which she appeared in 1961. It was ''The Tattooed Countess,'' not ''The Tattooed Princess.''       
         Agnes Cunningham, a founder of the influential folk-song journal Broadside, died on Sunday at a nursing home in New Paltz, N.Y., her daughter Jane Friesen said. She was 95.         Broadside, begun by Ms. Cunningham and her husband, Gordon Friesen, in 1962, published more than 1,000 topical songs during its 26-year run, including some of the first works by Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Janis Ian, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Tom Paxton. Though its circulation never reached higher than four figures, it lasted for 187 issues and played a significant role in the development of the 60's folk style.         ''This very small magazine, it reached key people throughout the country,'' Pete Seeger, a frequent contributor, said yesterday. ''When a good song came along, it got picked up right away.''         For the magazine's first issues, Ms. Cunningham, known as Sis, and Mr. Friesen invited musicians from the New York folk scene to their apartment in the Frederick Douglass housing project on West 104th Street in Manhattan to perform their newest songs into a reel-to-reel tape recorder.         They chose songs with strong leftist politics and a direct style, and stated their aims in the first issue with a quotation from Woody Guthrie that ''a good song can only do good.''         ''We favored singers who were simple and didn't have all the fluff,'' Ms. Cunningham said in an interview with The New York Times in 2001. ''Poetry set to music has to be mulled over. I think the more sharply and simply it's written, the better.''         Mr. Dylan's ''Blowin' in the Wind'' was published on the cover of the sixth issue, in May 1962, shortly after the song was written. Malvina Reynolds, whose songs often appeared in Broadside, had ''Little Boxes'' in issue No. 20; ''I Ain't Marching Anymore'' by Mr. Ochs, another frequent contributor, was in issue No. 54.         The couple churned out the early issues using a mimeograph machine once owned by the American Labor Party. Because it was illegal to run a business in their housing project, they smuggled copies out the door in a baby carriage.         As a singer and an accordionist, Ms. Cunningham had played with Mr. Seeger and Mr. Guthrie in the Almanac Singers during the 1940's. At Broadside, she transcribed the chords and lyrics to songs from tape recordings made by musicians. Mr. Friesen, a novelist and journalist, wrote the commentaries.         Songs from the magazine were collected in 2000 on a five-CD boxed set, ''The Best of Broadside, 1962-1988,'' on the Smithsonian Folkways label. The album was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for best historical album and best liner notes.         Born to a poor farming family in Watonga, Okla., Ms. Cunningham graduated from what was then called Southwestern State College in Weatherford, Okla., and married Mr. Friesen, another Oklahoman, in 1941. They came to New York late that year and moved into the communal Almanac House in Greenwich Village with Mr. Seeger, Mr. Guthrie and others. Ms. Cunningham joined the Almanac Singers and performed on their 1942 album, ''Dear Mr. President.''         With Mr. Friesen, who died in 1996, she wrote ''Red Dust and Broadsides: A Joint Autobiography,'' which was published in 1999.         Besides Ms. Friesen, of New Paltz, Ms. Cunningham is survived by another daughter, Agnes Friesen, of Berkeley, Calif.; three grandchildren; and one great-grandson.       
         Rosemary Breslin, a journalist and screenwriter who wrote a piquant memoir about her own stubbornly undiagnosable illness, died yesterday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47.         The cause was cardiac and renal failure associated with a blood disorder, family members said. Fourteen years ago, she began suffering increasingly serious bouts of what she thought was influenza but was later labeled an autoimmune blood disorder.         In the 1990's, Ms. Breslin and her father, Jimmy Breslin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper columnist, both published books about their life-threatening illnesses and gave joint interviews about them.         Mr. Breslin's book, ''I Want to Thank My Brain for Remembering Me'' (Little, Brown and Company, 1996), was about his successful operation for a brain aneurysm. Ms. Breslin's book, ''Not Exactly What I Had in Mind: An Incurable Love Story'' (Random House, 1997), was about coping with regular and painful blood transfusions while also growing into a marriage and career.         In 1992, Ms. Breslin married Anthony Dunne, an independent builder of movie sets who later became a producer of documentary films. In 1993, while she was briefly a writer for ''NYPD Blue,'' Ms. Breslin was hospitalized for a month at U.C.L.A. Medical Center. She recovered and was able to write her book and, in 2000, help her husband establish an Internet venture, HauteDecor.com, a virtual interior design center that foundered, like many other Web ventures of the time.         In 2002, Ms. Breslin and Mr. Dunne won awards for two documentaries related to the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, ''Women of Rockaway'' and ''A Smile Gone, But Where?''         Ms. Breslin graduated from Hamilton College. In addition to her husband, father and stepmother, Ronnie M. Eldridge, a former City Councilwoman, she is survived by her sister, Kelly, and her brothers, James, Kevin, Patrick and Christopher.       
         Emma Buck, who ran a pre-Civil War family farm in Illinois that remained virtually unchanged into the 21st century, died on June 5 on the sleigh bed with handmade ticking she had slept in for 98 years, in the log cabin built by her great-uncle, a German immigrant, in 1849.         She was 100 or 101, said Annie Rieken, a close friend and director of the Heritage Foundation of Monroe County, where the farm is located. The cause of death was breast cancer, Ms. Rieken said.         The 70-acre farm, a sort of rural Smithsonian, was named one of the state's 10 most endangered sites in 1998 by the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. Miss Buck, who had pulled the last of her own teeth some years ago, lived there without running water, drawing her water from a well. Until two days before she died, she walked to the outhouse, one of many structures on the farm.         It also has a blacksmith's shop, a smokehouse, a butchering shed, a threshing barn and a rare outdoor bake oven.         Miss Buck sharpened scythes on a foot-operated grinding wheel well into her 90's. Speaking with a thick German accent, the slightly persnickety Miss Buck always wore a skirt as she worked.         ''Emma could be blunt and coarse and uncouth by Emily Post standards,'' Ms. Rieken said. ''But there was a total authenticity about her.''         To spend time with Miss Buck was to feel the evocative power of a place that has all but vanished from the American landscape, a fragile holdover where it was possible to encounter wooden butter churns, hobnail boots, copper kettles for making sausage and apple butter and hoops for a Conestoga wagon in the rafters.         ''That was German business,'' she once said speaking of the heavy trough in the smokehouse, used to scald the fur off carcasses, and her other implements. ''What would you do with all these things? Throw them out?''         While contemporaries embraced tractors and other modern machinery, the Buck family stuck to the old ways. The farm was settled by Miss Buck's maternal great-grandparents, Christian and Christina Henke, German immigrants from East Friesland who came by boat from New Orleans and settled in western Illinois, about 35 miles down river from St. Louis, in 1841. As was the custom among German families in the area, Emma and her sister Anna, who died in 1992, worked side by side with their father, Fred, who died in 1966. A brother, Albert, died in 1999. Emma Buck never married and leaves no survivors.         ''The Buck farmstead is a rare glimpse into the past,'' said Mike Jackson, chief architect with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. ''It is an extremely well-preserved place, maintained by a woman who lived a 19th-century life throughout the 20th century. Its significance is far greater than its humble origins.''         In 1999, Miss Buck deeded the property to Ahne Road Farms Inc., a nonprofit foundation in nearby Waterloo created with her lawyer, Otto Faulbaum, to preserve the farm as a historic site and interpretive center.         The goal is to inventory the farm's historic buildings and to lay the groundwork for long-term stewardship. ''Farms like Emma's were once common in the Midwest, but everybody else is gone and now the antiques are hanging in some suburban ranch house somewhere,'' Mr. Faulbaum said. ''We would like to restore the whole place as a living history museum and to preserve the farm intact.''         Miss Buck was buried June 6, in the old-fashioned way: by friends and neighbors who lowered her pine coffin into the ground in a corner of the cornfield, the stalks waist high.         She had left clear instructions. ''She said she didn't want an open casket,'' Ms. Rieken said. ''She said, 'If people couldn't visit me alive, they have no business visiting me as a dirty old dead woman.'''         Before covering the coffin, friends threw oranges onto the vault, recalling a story Miss Buck would tell about her grandmother Christina Bode. When German settlers heard there was sickness aboard the ship that brought her from Germany, they rowed into the harbor and tossed oranges onto the deck.         ''Life is like that ship,'' Miss Buck would say. ''Sometimes it blows forward, sometimes back. And just when you think all is lost, someone throws an orange on your deck.''       
         Lillian Seril, who as landlord of a grand Upper West Side apartment building, the Belnord, became the central figure in one of New York City's longest rent strikes, died on Monday at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and had been living as a tenant at the building she once owned, at 225 West 86th Street.         Her death was announced by her family in a paid notice in The New York Times.         The 16-year battle between Mrs. Seril and her tenants played out on a suitably historic stage. The Belnord, an ornate Italian Renaissance building 12 stories tall, occupies the entire block between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. It was advertised as the largest apartment house in the world when it was completed in 1908 and was designated as a New York City landmark in 1966.         Designed to be one of the city's most luxurious residences, it has huge, high-ceilinged apartments and surrounds a half-acre courtyard. It became a center of the Upper West Side's intellectual life, home over the years to figures like the Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Actors Studio founder Lee Strasberg and the actor Zero Mostel.         But the Belnord was more than a glamorous address; it also was one of Manhattan's biggest real estate bargains. When Mrs. Seril and her husband, Nathan, became sole owners of the building in 1974, two-thirds of its 225 apartments were covered under the city's rent control law, which originated as a federal plan in World War II to prevent war profiteering. With prices averaging $60 per room, tenants of rent-controlled 10-room apartments could pay less than $500 per month, well below the market rate even then.         Upon taking over the building, the Serils said some tenants owed back rent and accused others of infractions from illegal subletting to ripping out fixtures to installing appliances that put a dangerous strain on the building's wires and pipes.         Tenants had their own complaints: elevators frequently went out of service; pipes burst; the roof leaked; plaster fell from ceilings: the building often had no hot water, or no water at all. The tenants also said the Serils would not allow them to make repairs themselves.         To the Serils, these problems were a simple matter of economics. As their son-in-law, Owen C. Pell, later told said, ''If you keep the rents in the building lower than they are in the South Bronx, how do you stop the property from running down?''         The rent strike began in 1978, joined by nearly half of the Belnord's residents. It was soon followed by litigation that became so bitter that the Manhattan Housing Court judge originally assigned to the case withdrew in 1980 after the collapse of a settlement he had arranged, saying that the two sides ''deserved each other.''         When the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development was asked to intervene in the dispute four years later, he said, ''I'm not going to get myself into a West Beirut situation, where one or both parties are shooting at us.''         The battle continued through the 1980's, outliving Mr. Seril, who died in 1981. At one point, a court-appointed administrator was put in charge of the building, a step usually taken against slumlords. Later, a justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that many strikers were withholding rent to force Mrs. Seril to sell the building or to convert it to condominiums or cooperatives; he also found that some of the strikers were failing to place their withheld rent in escrow, in effect living rent free.         The strike finally came to an end in October 1994, when Mrs. Seril agreed to sell the building to investors for $15 million, or about $66,000 an apartment. Experts estimated that she could have asked two or three times as much if the rents had been at market level and the building had been in better shape.         Her opponents were surprised when she finally sold the Belnord.         ''Mrs. Seril has turned down many offers from buyers,'' a tenant leader said. ''The tenants have even offered to buy the building. This is not about money.''         Born Lillian Trachtenberg, Mrs. Seril is survived by her daughters Barbara and Pearl, her stepdaughter Zena Carp, her sisters Ada Hinden and Gladys Feigenbaum, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Seril remained a part of the Belnord saga even after selling the building. In a long speech before the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1996, she criticized the new owners' renovation plans and their intention of putting a large supermarket in the building's basement. This time Mrs. Seril, who lived in a 3,000-square-foot, $450-a-month, rent-controlled apartment in the Belnord, was speaking as a tenant.       
         Doris Dowling, who made an impression as a husky-voiced character actress in the film classics ''The Lost Weekend,'' ''The Blue Dahlia'' and ''Bitter Rice,'' died on June 18 in Los Angeles. She was 81.         Her death was announced by Lee Redmond, a family friend.         Ms. Dowling was the brunette sibling of a well-known blond actress of the era, Constance Dowling. The sisters appeared together when Doris made her Broadway debut in the 1940 hit musical ''Panama Hattie.''         She was back on Broadway briefly in ''Banjo Eyes'' (1941), ''Beat the Band'' (1942), ''New Faces of 1943'' and, later, in a revival of ''The Women'' (1973). But she spent the better part of her career in Hollywood and in Italy, where Constance had gone to work as an expatriate.         After an unheralded beginning in an earlier Raymond Chandler movie, ''And Now Tomorrow'' (1944), she made an auspicious appearance in ''The Lost Weekend'' (1945), an Oscar-winning film starring Ray Milland as an alcoholic. Ms. Dowling played Gloria, the available barfly with a heart whom he meets on his downward spiral.         In ''The Blue Dahlia'' (1946), a Raymond Chandler thriller starring Alan Ladd, she was the faithless wife who is murdered.         In Italy, Ms. Dowling took the part of Francesca, a gangster moll hiding among rice workers, in ''Riso Amaro'' (1949). The film gave the actress Silvana Mangano her sensational start and opened as ''Bitter Rice'' in this country in 1950.         Ms. Dowling made several more pictures in Italy and France, among them Orson Welles's version of ''Othello'' (1952), in which she played the small role of Bianca; Welles portrayed the Moor.         After returning to this country, she was a frequent guest star on television into the 1980's, and appeared often on the stage in Los Angeles.         Ms. Dowling was married three times. In 1952 she became the seventh of the bandleader Artie Shaw's eight wives. Her marriage to him was dissolved, but their son, Jonathan Shaw, survives, according to The Associated Press. In 1960 she married Leonard B. Kaufman, a television producer, who also survives her.         Constance Dowling died in Los Angeles in 1969. She was 49.       
         Paula Danziger, who established herself as a writer of popular fiction for young readers with her first book, ''The Cat Ate My Gymsuit,'' died on Thursday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59.         The cause was complications of a heart attack she suffered on June 9, said Doug Whiteman, president of Penguin Young Readers Group, the publisher of most of her books.         Her smart-talking fictional voice, making light of family problems large and small, carried through a 30-year career in which she wrote more than 30 books.         Ms. Danziger was born in Washington and reared in Metuchen, N.J. She earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in education from Montclair State College.         Although she wanted to be a writer, Ms. Danziger began working as a substitute teacher in 1967 and taught at the junior high school level for several years. After being injured in two automobile accidents, she decided not to postpone her ambition any longer and wrote her first book.         Building on the success of ''Gymsuit,'' Ms. Danziger also became a popular speaker. She decked herself out with rhinestone-trimmed glasses, feather hats and beaded outfits, talked fast and was funny.         She often said in interviews that her alternative career choice was stand-up comedian, and she was as glamorous to the school audiences she visited as Dame Edna Everage. Moreover, to the delight of her young fans, she could use mirror writing as well as a conventional signature when she autographed their books.         In 1994, in ''Amber Brown Is Not a Crayon,'' she introduced a deadpan heroine inspired by her niece, Carrie Danziger. The book led to two hugely popular series of Amber Brown adventures, the original for middle school students and a later one for early readers.         With her friend, Ann M. Martin, the author of ''The Baby Sitters Club'' series, Ms. Danziger also wrote two epistolary novels for slightly older readers, ''P.S. Longer Letter Later'' and ''Snail Mail No More.'' All of Ms. Danziger's books are in print in the United States, and many have been published in 53 countries and 14 languages.         Her survivors, in addition to her niece, are a brother, Barry Danziger of Califon, N.J., and three nephews.       
         Sandra Helen Payson, a socially prominent patron of the arts, died on July 15 in Manhattan, where she was visiting. A former New Yorker, she was 78 and lived in Washington and Delaplane, Va.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Payson was the founder and president of the Beard's Fund, through which she supported groups in the performing arts and individual artists. She also sponsored fellowships for aspiring artists.         The daughter of Charles Shipman Payson, an industrialist, and Joan Whitney Payson, founder of the New York Mets baseball team, she grew up in Manhasset, N.Y., where she founded the Manhasset Stable for thoroughbred racing, which she later moved to Delaplane.         She was a board member of the Lincoln Center Institute for Arts in Education, the Whitney Museum, the Madeira School and the Research Center at the New York Public Library. She also was active in the Women's Leadership Forum of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.         Her two marriages, to William Blair Meyer and George (later Lord) Weidenfeld of London, ended in divorce.         Ms. Payson is survived by a son, William Blair Meyer Jr. of Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Joan Curci Meyer of London and Porto Ercole, Italy, and Averil Payson Meyer of New York City and Katonah, N.Y.; two sisters, Payne Whitney Middleton of Manhattan, and Lorinda Payson deRoulet of Manhasset; a brother, John Whitney Payson of Jupiter Island, Fla.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Myra Waldo, a writer who filled bookshelves with advice on places to see and their cuisines, died Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 88 and formerly lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         Starting in the mid-1950's, Ms. Waldo wrote more than two dozen travel guides and cookbooks, which she periodically updated. Her ''Serve at Once: The Soufflé Cookbook'' of 1954, for instance, was revised as ''The Soufflé Cookbook'' in 1961 and, reissued in 1990, remains in print. A book she wrote in 1955 with the actress Gertrude Berg, ''The Molly Goldberg Cookbook,'' based on Ms. Berg's famous television character, was reissued most recently in 1999.         Myra Waldo was born in Manhattan and attended Columbia University. In 1937 she married Robert J. Schwartz, a lawyer, who died in 1997. She used her maiden name professionally.         Ms. Waldo worked on special projects for the Macmillan Publishing Company in the late 1960's. From 1968 to 1972, she was on the air as food and travel editor of WCBS radio, a job that led to her 1971 ''Restaurant Guide to New York City and Vicinity,'' which she continued to revise into the 1980's.         Her first book, as editor, was ''The Complete Round-the-World Cookbook,'' featuring recipes gathered by Pan American Airways (Doubleday, 1954, revised 1973).         There followed books about Roman, Northern Italian, Spanish and Asian food, about meals at restaurants that accepted the Diners Club card, and others about barbecues and desserts and cooking with wine. She wrote ''The International Encyclopedia of Cooking'' and ''The Dictionary of International Food and Cooking Terms'' (Macmillan, 1967).         Ms. Waldo's travel guides to Europe were each updated several times. She later added guides to South America, the South Pacific and Japan. She was a consultant to airlines and hotels.         Ms. Waldo is survived by her sister, Naomi Waldo Holtzman of Oakland, Calif.         Correction:  August 4, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Myra Waldo, an author of travel guides and cookbooks, gave an incomplete title for a book she wrote with the actress Gertrude Berg. It was ''The Molly Goldberg Jewish Cookbook,'' not ''The Molly Goldberg Cookbook.''       
         Isabel Sanford, the Emmy Award-winning actress who portrayed Louise Jefferson, the stoically beleaguered better half to Sherman Hemsley's reactionary in ''All in the Family'' and ''The Jeffersons,'' died on Friday at a Los Angeles hospital. She was 86 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Sanford's health had declined since she had preventive surgery on a carotid artery 10 months ago, said her longtime manager and publicist, Brad Lemack.         At an age when many actresses would have called it quits, Ms. Sanford made her feature film debut in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?'' in 1967 after having caught the eye of its director, Stanley Kramer, in the 1965 Broadway production of James Baldwin's ''Amen Corner.''         As Tillie, the Drayton family's staunchly loyal housekeeper, Ms. Sanford displayed a defiant acceptance of position and disdain for interracial marriage that stood in stark contrast to the presumed liberalism of the characters portrayed by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.         The portrayal impressed show-business insiders, including the television producer Norman Lear, who in 1971 hired Ms. Sanford to play a Queens neighbor to the confrontational Archie Bunker, and an eventual friend to his wife, Edith, in ''All in the Family.'' In 1975, Mr. Lear moved the Jeffersons, by now the owners of a successful dry-cleaning franchise, and their son, Lionel, to a ''deluxe apartment in the sky'' on the East Side of Manhattan.         In 1981, Ms. Sanford became the first black woman to win an Emmy for best actress in a comedy series. The show was canceled in 1985.         In an ''Intimate Portrait'' on Lifetime Television last year, Ms. Sanford called herself a survivor: literally, as the youngest of seven children and the only one to survive infancy, and figuratively, as she came to rely on her comedic skills for respite from her poverty-stricken childhood in Harlem. As a teenager, she dreamed of becoming an actress, earning raves at an amateur night at the Apollo Theater before her mother's death quashed her aspirations, leaving Ms. Sanford to take over her job as a cleaning woman.         Still, amid a troubled marriage and the birth of three children, Ms. Sanford joined the Star Players, later the American Negro Theater, in the 1930's and made her stage debut in the company's 1946 production of ''On Strivers Row.''         In 1960, she moved with her children to Los Angeles, where the actress Tallulah Bankhead almost immediately asked her to join the national production of ''Here Today'' -- a job that Ms. Sanford said resulted in her first encounter with discrimination, as she found herself relegated to separate sleeping and dining quarters from her white colleagues.         Ms. Sanford is survived by two sons and a daughter, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Bella Lewitzky, a modern-dance pioneer and an outspoken champion of artistic freedom, died on Friday in an assisted-care center in Pasadena, Calif. She was 88.         She had a heart attack after a stroke, said Marjorie Perces, a friend.         A fearless and tireless dancer, choreographer, teacher and cultural crusader, Ms. Lewitzky struggled to make modern dance a major art form in California and to make Los Angeles an important dance center. She campaigned passionately for government support of the arts. Yet she was undaunted by attempts to limit artistic freedom.         Ms. Lewitzky, who was politically active all her life, was called before a hearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1951 and asked to identify acquaintances who might have been members of the Communist Party. She declined to supply names, giving the punning reply, ''I am a dancer, not a singer.''         Decades later, when the National Endowment for the Arts started requiring grant recipients to sign an anti-obscenity pledge, Ms. Lewitzky and her company filed a lawsuit, and in January 1991, a federal judge found the pledge unconstitutional.         Ms. Lewitzky was born in Llano del Rio, a utopian socialist community in the Mojave Desert. Her family later settled in San Bernardino, where Ms. Lewitzky received dance and piano lessons. Dance especially fascinated her, and her love of the art grew during the 1930's, when she attended classes taught by Lester Horton, the Los Angeles area's most prominent modern dancer at that time.         She soon established herself as a charismatic performer with the Horton Dance Group, starring in highly dramatic works by Mr. Horton like ''Salome'' (1937) and ''The Beloved'' (1948), in which she portrayed a wife accused of adultery by her puritanical husband.         Other company members included Rudi Gernreich, who became an innovative fashion designer and a stage designer for some of Ms. Lewitzky's later productions, and Newell Reynolds, Ms. Lewitzky's husband, who later became an architect.         Ms. Lewitzky left Horton in 1950 to pursue an independent career. She developed a considerable reputation as a dynamic teacher, holding posts at the University of Southern California, the Idyllwild arts school (accepting an appointment there without signing its loyalty oath) and the California Institute of the Arts. She also served as a guest teacher around the world.         She directed the Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitzky Dance Company from 1966 to 1997. It first traveled to the East Coast in 1971, appearing at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         As a performer, Ms. Lewitzky was a fiery stage personality. Anna Kisselgoff described her in The New York Times in 1971 as ''an extraordinary artist with an astounding mastery of technique.''         But as the creator of works like ''On the Brink of Time'' (1969), ''Kinaesonata'' (1970) and ''Greening'' (1976), she favored a cooler choreographic style.         In directing her group, Ms. Lewitzky was deeply concerned about her dancers' welfare. Her company members were always fully insured, and she paid them annual salaries even when they did not perform every month of a year.         Ms. Lewitzky served on the dance panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and on the California Arts Council and was the recipient of the Dance Magazine Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Tiffany Award, the National Medal of Arts, the Capezio Award and, in 1989, the first California Governor's Award for Lifetime Achievement.         Ms. Lewitzky and her husband lived in New Mexico in the 1990's but returned to Southern California in 2001. In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Nora Reynolds, a dancer, and two grandsons, Keenan and Ross McCune.       
         Anne Gorsuch Burford, a Colorado conservative who was chosen by President Ronald Reagan as his top environmental regulator only to resign under Congressional fire 22 months later, died Sunday in Aurora, Colo. She was 62.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Stephanie Gorsuch of Denver, said.         In appointing her administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, President Reagan made Ms. Burford a leader in his effort to bring economic discipline to environmental cleanup and to give the states greater enforcement powers on matters like clean air and water, policies she had earlier advocated on the state level. Critics contended that the policies weakened federal environmental enforcement to please polluting industries.         This fundamental difference in perspective reached a climax in a battle between a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, which demanded thousands of pages of documents relating to toxic waste cleanup, and Ms. Burford, who refused to hand them over. She said she would go to jail rather than surrender them to Congress.         Eventually, the White House gave up its claim of executive privilege to keep the documents secret, and Ms. Burford resigned on March 9, 1983.         In her tenure as the second-ranking woman in the Reagan administration, after the United Nations Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Ms. Burford showed sharp intelligence, as well as a taste for confrontation with environmental groups.         Environmentalists like Gaylord Nelson, chairman of the Wilderness Society, accused her of ''a wholesale dismantling'' of environmental advances, but Ms. Burford insisted that she was bringing cost-effective market forces to the regulation of pollution.         Anne Irene McGill was born on April 21, 1942, in Casper, Wyo. Her father, a surgeon, moved the family to Denver when she was an infant.         She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in two years and finished law school there at 20, then became the youngest woman admitted to the Colorado bar. She used a Fulbright scholarship to study criminal law in India.         She worked for a bank and then as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson County, Colo., and as deputy district attorney for the City of Denver. After working at two state regulatory agencies, she became a lawyer for Mountain Bell Telephone.         In 1976, she was elected to the first of two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of a group that called itself the Crazies for its members' passionate devotion to states' rights and opposition to federal energy and environmental policies. She was named outstanding freshman legislator and worked on legislation concerning hazardous wastes and vehicle emissions.         In 1964, she married David Gorsuch, whom she divorced in 1982. The next year, she married Robert Burford, a rancher who was then head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. He died in 1993, while divorce proceedings were in progress. Ms. Burford returned to private law practice after her resignation.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her sons, J.J. Gorsuch of Denver and Neil Gorsuch of Vienna, Va.; her mother, Dorothy McGill of Denver; her sisters, Mary Edwards of Severna Park, Md., Theresa Peace of Lincoln, Neb., Dorothy McGill of El Paso, Tex., Veronica Urban of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Rosie Binger of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, Joe McGill of Plano, Tex.; and four grandchildren.         James Watt, who became Mr. Reagan's interior secretary, and James Coors, the Colorado brewing and energy magnate, sponsored Ms. Burford for the E.P.A. post. Her confirmation was held up for months as senators debated her qualifications and questioned her agenda, but the outcome was never in serious doubt.         When her nomination hearing was finally held on May 1, 1981, she began by speaking lyrically of her own environment.         ''As a long-term Coloradan,'' she said, ''I come before you with a deep appreciation of the unique beauties which we enjoy in our environment -- the majesty and grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the openness and sense of space of our eastern plains.''       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Helen K. Copley, former publisher of The San Diego Union-Tribune and its predecessors and a prominent philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the newspaper said.         Mrs. Copley began working at the Union Tribune Publishing Company as a secretary in 1953. She became the publisher in 1973, taking the position after the death of her husband, James S. Copley. She retired in 2001.         Until 1992, the company's two flagship newspapers, The San Diego Union and its afternoon sister paper, The San Diego Tribune, were the major competing papers in the city. Responding to declining circulation numbers and a drop in advertising, Mrs. Copley merged the two papers into The Union-Tribune, a morning paper. It is now the third-largest newspaper in California, with a daily circulation of 355,000. The Sunday circulation is 445,000.         As the population grew in San Diego, Mrs. Copley dealt with growing competition from smaller papers and a regional edition of The Los Angeles Times. In her first years as publisher, she sought to meet with all 1,500 employees of the company in small groups in an effort to improve morale. Under her tenure, The San Diego Tribune won two Pulitzer prizes.         Copley Press Inc., which owns the Union-Tribune Publishing Company, publishes eight other daily newspapers, in California, Illinois and Ohio. Keeping Copley Press in family hands was a priority for Mrs. Copley, and she turned it over to her son, David C. Copley, when she retired.         Margaret Helen Kinney was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Nov. 28, 1922. After a stint in the Waves in the 1940's and a brief marriage, she moved to San Diego with her mother in 1951.         In 1953, Mrs. Copley answered an ad for a job at the Union Tribune Publishing Company. She began working as a secretary for Mr. Copley, who had become chief executive of Copley Press after the death of his father, Ira C. Copley, who started the company in 1905. In 1965, she married Mr. Copley; eight years later, he died of brain cancer.         Mrs. Copley, whose worth was estimated to be $960 million by Forbes magazine last year, gave millions to the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. She also underwrote the construction of a library at the University of San Diego.         In addition to her son, David, of La Jolla, Mrs. Copley's survivors include a sister, Mary Frances Davison of Santa Maria, Calif.; a brother, Frank E. Kinney of Cedar Rapids; and two stepchildren from her husband's first marriage, Michael Copley of San Diego and Janice Obre of New York.       
         Gloria Emerson, a journalist and author who wrote with angry dignity about the effects of war on Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, was found dead by friends and the police yesterday morning in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 75 and left no immediate survivors.         The medical examiner's office said that it had not ruled on the cause of death. Her physician, Karen Brudney, said Ms. Emerson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, which she feared would leave her unable to write, and she left many notes at the apartment indicating that she had taken her own life.         Both as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Vietnam in the early 1970's and later as a writer of nonfiction books and a novel, Ms. Emerson wrote passionately about ordinary people and soldiers ground up by the machinery of war in places like Vietnam, Gaza and Algeria.         War as she wrote about it was not ennobling but debasing, a misery that inflicted physical suffering and psychic damage on civilians, children, and soldiers on both sides. Her literary model was Graham Greene, whose dark portrayal of the early days of the American war in Vietnam influenced her articles and her style. ''Loving Graham Greene'' was the title she gave her novel, published by Random House in 2000.         She was working in the London bureau of The Times in 1969 when, as she wrote in an obituary she left with a covering note that was dated Tuesday, ''Ms. Emerson requested that she be sent to Vietnam because she had been in that country in 1956 and wanted to go back to write about the Vietnamese people and the immense unhappy changes in their lives, not a subject widely covered by the huge press corps who were preoccupied with covering the military story.''         Her articles from Vietnam, many reported with the help of Nguyen Ngoc Luong, her interpreter, brought alive for many readers people who had been an abstraction, the Vietnamese whose ''hearts and minds'' the United States went to war to win, but lost to communist adversaries who prevailed despite millions of casualties.         One of her articles after the unsuccessful South Vietnamese attempt to cut off North Vietnamese supply lines in Laos in 1971 reported how Sergeant Co, an infantry platoon leader, clung to the skids of an American helicopter to get out alive. '''Each helicopter could have been the last one, so what choice was there for me?' he asked. 'Only the madmen would stay and politely wait for the next helicopter.'''         Her literary voice was always gravely serious. In person, she was well dressed, precise in speech and eccentrically funny.         She was constantly giving money to veterans, refugees and street beggars. She could be possessive and domineering, especially toward the photographers whose work she thought would outlast her articles published with them; the words she compared to ice cubes that melted in the sun.         As Ms. Emerson put it in her own obituary: ''Her dispatches from Vietnam won a George Polk Award for excellence in foreign reporting, and, later, a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Her nonfiction book on the war, 'Winners & Losers' (Random House, 1977), won a National Book Award in 1978 but she described it as 'too huge and somewhat messy.' Its subject was the effects of the conflict on some Americans, or 'an absence of the effect,' as she once said.''         Typical of ''Winners & Losers'' were lines like these, about Joseph (Teddy) Humber Jr., who lost both his legs in a mine explosion in Vietnam in 1972 and came home to his family in Westboro, Mass. ''Teddy did not seem to always know what the others were saying,'' she wrote. ''He seemed busy with something else; perhaps it was pain. He sat at the table without moving, often without hearing.''         Another book in 1985, ''Some American Men,'' published by Simon & Schuster, ranged further into the souls of her countrymen and their afflictions in sports and love as well as in war. ''Gaza, a Year in the Intifada,'' about a year she spent with Palestinians in what she called ''an occupied land,'' was published by The Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991.         ''Made to feel inferior, treated with contempt and cruelty, the Gazans struggled to transcend their own feelings of helplessness,'' she wrote then.         ''The book provoked hostility among friends, and others felt it was anti-Israel, but Ms. Emerson insisted this was not the reason for writing it,'' she explained later, in the obituary she left behind. ''She hoped to provide a primer for those who felt the situation in the Middle East was too complicated or too controversial to understand.''         Born in New York City to William B. Emerson and Ruth Shaw Emerson in 1929, she began her career in The Times's women's news department in 1957, describing herself on her application as a widow, giving her married name as Znamiecki.         ''I applied for a job at The New York Times many years ago, and felt correctly that my life depended on it,'' she explained in a note written just before her death. ''I didn't go to college, I ran away from an alcoholic wretched home and went to work on a hotel giveaway magazine.'' She continued, ''Getting a job on the women's page was a gift from heaven although I hated writing about shoes and clothes, all under the eye of the advertising department who measured editorial mention of retailers. You cannot imagine what it was like in those days.''         She left the paper in 1960 to live in Brussels with Charles A. Brofferio, whom she described as ''an ill-suited husband'' she divorced a year later.         The Times hired her back as a reporter in Paris in 1964 ''on the understanding that I would cover the haute couture collections twice a year,'' she explained. Moving to the paper's London bureau in late 1968, she made her way to Belfast to write some articles about the conflict in Northern Ireland, and in 1970, as she put it, ''I was allowed to go to Vietnam because the war was supposed to be over so it didn't matter if a female was sent. Et voilà!''       
         Geraldine Peroni, an Academy Award-nominated film editor known for her work with Robert Altman, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan, said her sister, Pamela O'Grady. She was 51.         The New York City medical examiner's office ruled the death a suicide, but Ms. Peroni's family is disputing that finding.         Ms. Peroni was Mr. Altman's favorite editor and worked on eight of his films beginning with ''Vincent & Theo'' in 1990 and continuing through ''The Company'' last year.         She was nominated for an Oscar for her editing of ''The Player'' in 1992. She also edited Mr. Altman's ''Short Cuts,'' ''Prêt-à-Porter,'' ''Kansas City,'' ''Gingerbread Man'' and ''Dr. T and the Women.''         Over the years Mr. Altman developed a close working relationship with Ms. Peroni and often praised her work and her judgment as being an essential part of his movie making.         ''It gets to the point where I could be shooting a scene and a little bird will jump into my ear and say, 'Gerri's not going to like this,''' Mr. Altman said in a recent interview in DGA magazine, a publication of the Directors Guild of America.         Ms. Peroni was born in Manhattan and raised in Rockaway Beach, Queens.         She studied film at Hunter College, and her first job in the movies was as an editorial apprentice on the 1983 film ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.''         She was the first assistant editor, under Thelma Schoonmaker, on Martin Scorsese's ''Last Temptation of Christ'' (1988) and received her first credit as editor on ''Iron & Silk'' (1990).         She also edited ''Johnny Suede'' and ''The Safety of Objects,'' among other films.         Besides her sister, of Belle Harbor, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Peter, of Ormond Beach, Fla.       
         Fay Wray, an actress who appeared in about 100 movies but whose fame is inextricably linked with the hours she spent struggling, helplessly screaming, in the eight-foot hand of King Kong, died on Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 96.         Rick McKay, a director and her friend, said she died peacefully in her sleep. He recalled that Miss Wray's family moved to the United States from Canada in a stagecoach and said that she was possibly the longest-living true star of silent films.         As sound and color came to the movies, Miss Wray remained at the top, but it was the celebrated role that took her to the top of a very tall building that elevated her to cinematic immortality.         The huge success of ''King Kong,'' a beauty-and-the-beast film that opened in New York at both Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy in 1933, led to roles for Miss Wray in other 1930's films in which her life or her virtue, or both, were imperiled. But she was always aware that she would be remembered for the pivotal scene of ''King Kong,'' in which the giant ape carries her to the top of the Empire State Building, gently places her on a ledge, lunges furiously at fighter planes peppering him with bullets and falls to his death.         ''When I'm in New York,'' Miss Wray wrote in The New York Times in 1969, ''I look at the Empire State Building and feel as though it belongs to me, or is it vice versa?''         The most hazardous part of filming ''King Kong,'' Miss Wray recalled, was the tendency of the giant gorilla hand to loosen its grasp while she was suspended high above the set. When she felt she was about to fall, she implored the director, Merian C. Cooper, to have her lowered to the stage floor to rest a few minutes before being secured once again in the hand and sent aloft.         She spent an entire day recording additional screams, variously shrill and plaintive, that an editor later inserted in the soundtrack -- too often, she later emphasized. Asked how she was able to muster such animated cries, she replied, ''I made myself believe that the nearest possible hope of rescue was at least a mile away.''         Over the years, Miss Wray said, she came to feel that Kong had ''become a spiritual thing to many people, including me.''         In a 1987 interview, Miss Wray said she had been sent a script for the 1976 remake of ''King Kong,'' in which Jessica Lange played Kong's co-star, because its producers wanted her to play a small role. She said she disliked the script and declined the offer because ''the film I made was so extraordinary, so full of imagination and special effects, that it will never be equaled.''         Fay Wray was born on Sept. 15, 1907, on a farm in Alberta, a daughter of Jerry Wray, an inventor, and his wife, Vina. Vina Wray and her three daughters moved to Arizona by stagecoach when Fay was 3, and to Lark, Utah, when she was 5. Her father and two brothers had gone ahead.         By the time Fay was 12 or 13, her parents had separated, a sister had died of the flu, and the family was struggling financially. Fay's mother sent her to Los Angeles to live with a friend and pursue a movie career. She appeared in her first film, ''Gasoline Love,'' in 1923. She was an ingénue in a half-dozen silent westerns.         Her breakthrough came when Erich von Stroheim chose her to play the bride in his 1928 silent classic ''The Wedding March.'' Miss Wray was always drawn to writers, as she recounted in her 1989 autobiography, ''On the Other Hand.'' She was just 19 when she married John Monk Saunders, a Rhodes scholar and screenwriter known for films like ''Wings.'' She divorced him, she said, after he injected her with drugs while she slept, sold their house and their furniture and kept the money, and disappeared for a time with their baby daughter, Susan. Saunders hanged himself in 1940.         She was pursued by Sinclair Lewis and had a long romance with Clifford Odets. In 1942 she married Robert Riskin, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of ''It Happened One Night.'' They had two children, Vicki and Robert Jr. Riskin had a stroke in 1950 and died five years later. In 1971, she married Dr. Sanford Rothenberg, a neurosurgeon who had been one of Riskin's doctors. Dr. Rothenberg died in 1991.         Miss Wray retired in 1942 but made occasional movies in the 1950's and had a leading role in ''Gideon's Trumpet,'' a 1979 film with Henry Fonda. On television, she starred in a situation comedy, ''The Pride of the Family,'' from 1953 to 1955. In later years she also wrote plays that were produced in regional theaters.         Miss Wray is survived by her daughters Susan Riskin of Manhattan and Victoria Riskin of Los Angeles; her son, Robert Riskin Jr., of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.         In 1997, Miss Wray joined Julius Epstein, a writer of the film ''Casablanca,'' to testify to Congress in favor of greater copyright protection for pre-1960's film writers.         Last March Peter Jackson, the director, asked her over dinner if she would appear in his remake of ''King Kong.'' He wanted her to read the summary line, '''Twas beauty killed the beast.''         She thought that might be too confusing, said Mr. McKay, who was host at the dinner.         ''How can someone play me when I'm here?'' she asked.       
         Leslie Revsin, a culinary trailblazer who achieved celebrity early in her career as the first woman to work as a chef in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, died on Monday at her home in Shoreline, Wash., a suburb of Seattle. She was 59.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Philip Carlson.         In the early 1970's, when Ms. Revsin graduated from the hotel and restaurant program at New York Technical College in Brooklyn, there were very few well-known young Americans, let alone women, in the field of fine cuisine. One of her instructors encouraged her to apply for a job at the Waldorf, and in 1972 she started on the bottom rung as a ''kitchen man.'' A year later she was promoted to fish chef and achieved national renown.         In 1977 after a brief stint as the chef at P.S. 77, an outpost of fine dining on the Upper West Side, she opened her own place, Restaurant Leslie, on Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village, with nine tables and a highly personal interpretation of nouvelle cuisine. That was when her name became forever associated with Roquefort beignets on apple purée. Restaurant Leslie closed in 1981. It was the last time Ms. Revsin was her own boss.         She worked at many well-known Manhattan restaurants, starting with 24 Fifth Avenue in 1982, and including Bridge Cafe. Her job at Argenteuil ended abruptly in February 1988 after a dispute with Paul Gregory, the restaurant's owner.         In 1990 she became the chef at the Inn at Pound Ridge in Pound Ridge, N.Y., where she remained until 1995. It was her longest and last kitchen position. Her lengthy résumé in the kitchen ended with her eventual career shift from restaurant chef to consultant, television cook and cookbook author.         Her name began to appear on lists of top American chefs starting in 1983. In 1985 she was featured on a cooking series on public television, and she was on other television cooking shows for many years. She also wrote for several food magazines and became a spokeswoman and consultant for a pantry full of products, including olive oil, strawberries, catfish and Alaskan seafood.         In 1997 her first cookbook, ''Delicious Dinners From Fillets and Shellfish,'' was published by Doubleday, followed in 2003 by ''Come for Dinner'' (John Wiley & Sons). Three additional cookbooks are scheduled to be published by John Wiley & Sons in September and March.         Leslie Kim Revsin was born on Oct. 19, 1944, in Chicago. She attended the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated in 1966 from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. She became devoted to fine French cuisine and sharpened her skills cooking at home in Brooklyn before enrolling in the professional course.         Her marriage to Bill Arp, a television producer, ended in divorce. In 1980 she married Mr. Carlson, a talent agent. Her illness was diagnosed about a year ago, when they were moving to the Seattle area to be near Ms. Revsin's daughter, Rachel Arp Ramstead, and her family.         In addition to her husband and daughter, Ms. Revsin is survived by a brother, Ethan Revsin, of New Albany, Ohio, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 30, 2004, Monday  An obituary of the chef and cookbook author Leslie Revsin on Aug. 13 misstated the title of her first book. It was ''Great Fish Quick''; the subtitle was ''Delicious Dinners From Fillets and Shellfish.'' The obituary also misspelled the surname of Ms. Revsin's surviving daughter. She is Rachel Ramstad, not Ramstead.       
         Elly Annie Schneider, who was known for many years in the circus world and on the big screen as Tiny Earles, then Tiny Doll, and who played one of the Munchkins in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' died here on Sept. 6. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Marlene Grunewald, a longtime friend who took care of her.         Ms. Schneider was born in Stolpen, Germany, in 1914, the youngest of nine children. She came to the United States in 1925 to join two sisters and a brother, all of short stature. Ms. Schneider herself was 39 inches tall and never weighed more than 46 pounds. She became an American citizen at 21.         At first the siblings in the United States used the name Earles, the last name of the man who brought them to America. They changed it to Doll after Mr. Earles died.         Before retiring in the mid-1950's, the Doll family -- Harry, Grace, Daisy and Tiny -- performed with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. They appeared in several films, among them a Laurel and Hardy short, ''Sailors, Beware!'' in 1927, and the cult classic ''Freaks'' in 1932.         The family moved here in 1934. All four siblings traveled to California to appear in ''The Wizard of Oz.''         Ms. Schneider, the last of the Doll family, left no immediate survivors. Until two months ago, she would entertain her many friends by singing songs from ''The Wizard of Oz'' and her circus shows.       
         Françoise Sagan, the rebellious French writer who achieved fame as a teenager with her first novel, ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' a precocious tale of sexual disillusionment, but whose international reputation dimmed as literary tastes changed, died yesterday in Honfleur, in northern France. She was 69.         The cause was a blood clot in a lung, friends of her family told Agence France-Presse. She had been in poor health for several years.         Ms. Sagan had an enormous international success with ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' about an amoral teenager who sets out to keep her philandering widowed father from marrying again. The novel was originally published in France in 1954. The following year an English translation reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Sagan was only 19, making her the youngest author to achieve that feat at the time.         By early 1958, the book had sold 810,000 copies in France and more than a million in the United States and had been translated into 20 languages.         Serge Gavronsky, a professor of French literature at Barnard College, said in a 1995 interview that Ms. Sagan's early novels expressed the rebelliousness and cynicism of many of her peers in the French bourgeoisie. Those books, he said, ''were perfectly in accord with a moment of time'' -- the mid-1950's -- and ''well connected'' with France's literary past.         John Updike, writing in The New Yorker 20 years after ''Bonjour Tristesse'' appeared, praised ''its sparkling sea and secluding woods, its animal quickness, its academically efficient plot, its heroes and heroines given the perfection of Racine personae by the young author's innocent belief in glamour.''         Later works by Ms. Sagan appeared repeatedly on best-seller lists in France, and she went on to write more than a score of books, as well as plays, film scripts, short stories and song lyrics. Some of her novels were turned into movies -- ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and ''A Certain Smile'' in 1958 -- and she directed the 1977 French film ''Les Fougères Bleues.''         ''Les Auteurs de la Littérature Française,'' a standard French work for students, described Ms. Sagan's terrain as somewhat limited: ''a worldly, rich, idle, luxurious universe; some characters who live without material cares, who drink, who love themselves without conviction. A taste for the unfinished, for biting analysis, for narcissism. Sagan has forever been recounting the rotting of a generation.''         Roger Shattuck, a cultural historian and professor of French at Boston University, said in 1995 that Ms. Sagan's reputation ''had declined considerably after her first half-dozen novels'' because she wrote too much and repeated herself and because of changing literary fashions.         Ms. Sagan's view of herself and her life was sometimes harsh. In ''Et Toute Ma Sympathie,'' a 1993 book made up largely of reflections, she included a poem in which she called herself ''this bizarre woman, childish and messed up.''         In the first flush of Ms. Sagan's fame, she became known for drinking until dawn and gambling lavishly. It has been reported that she once made a killing at the gaming tables of Deauville and then turned around and used the money to buy herself a turn-of-the-century chateau.         She also praised the joys of driving sports cars. ''Whoever has not thrilled to speed has not thrilled to life,'' she wrote in ''With Fondest Regards'' (1985). ''However madly and hopelessly in love you may be, at 120 miles an hour you are less so. Your blood no longer congeals around your heart; your blood throbs to the extremities of your body, to your fingertips, your toes and your eyelids, now the fateful and tireless guardians of your own life.''         She suffered a skull fracture and other injuries in 1957 when her Aston-Martin overturned while she was living in Milly, a resort town in northern France.         Ms. Sagan was convicted twice of narcotics offenses, in 1990 and 1995, receiving fines and prison sentences, which were suspended.         She once told an investigating magistrate: ''I believe I have a right to destroy myself as long as it does not harm anyone. If I feel like swallowing a glass of caustic soda, that's my own problem.''In 2002 she was also convicted of tax fraud in a case involving payments she received in the early 1990's to intercede with François Mitterrand, a friend and then the president of France, in an oil deal. Her health prevented her from appearing in court.         Ms. Sagan was born on June 21, 1935, in Cajarc, a village in southwest France. She was the third and youngest child of Paul Quoirez, a well-to-do businessman, and his wife, Marie.         Françoise Quoirez, nicknamed Kiki, grew up largely in Lyons and on an estate in the Vercors region in the southeast. When she was 15, her family moved to Paris. She attended convent schools before an unsuccessful academic experience at the Sorbonne.         She took the pen name Sagan because she liked the way it sounded. The name also harked back to the Prince and Princesse de Sagan, 19th-century Parisians on whom Marcel Proust is said to have based some of his characters.         After two years at the Sorbonne, with much time spent in cafes and little studying, she failed crucial year-end examinations in June 1953, angering her family. She felt she ''had to do something'' to placate them, she would recall, so she sat down and wrote ''Bonjour Tristesse'' in August. She had already been thinking about the novel and making notes for it for some months.         The book begins with what has come to be seen as a vintage Sagan sentence: ''A strange melancholy pervades me, to which I hesitate to give the grave and beautiful name of sorrow.''         In ''With Fondest Regards,'' Ms. Sagan, noting that ''Bonjour Tristesse'' enjoyed a ''succès de scandale'' when it first came out in France, said that in those days she could not understand what all the fuss was about.         Looking back three decades later, she said the furor resulted partly from the relationship between the heroine, Cécile, and her boyfriend.         ''It was inconceivable,'' she wrote, ''that a young girl of 17 or 18 should make love without being in love with a boy of her own age, and not be punished for it.''         Furthermore, she added, people couldn't accept that this girl ''should know about her father's love affairs, discuss them with him, and thereby reach a kind of complicity with him on subjects that had until then been taboo between parents and children.''         Ms. Sagan continued to weave fiction from sentences that were a bit abstract in the French way but that at their best dealt trenchantly and economically with the emotions.         Her other novels published in translation in the United States include ''A Certain Smile'' (1956), ''Those Without Shadows'' (1957), ''Aimez-Vous Brahms?'' (1960), ''Wonderful Clouds'' (1962), ''La Chamade'' (1966), ''The Heart-Keeper'' (1968), ''A Few Hours of Sunlight'' (1971), ''The Painted Lady'' (1983), ''Incidental Music'' and ''Salad Days'' (1984).         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1983, Nora Johnson praised ''the grace and freshness of her early novels, those slender tales of love between aged children and middle-aged burnouts that seemed so remarkable when they began appearing in the 50's,'' observing that Ms. Sagan ''seemed to know everything then.''         Ms. Sagan won the Prix des Critiques in 1954 for ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and the Prix de Monaco 30 years later for her work as a whole.         Her 1958 marriage to Guy Schoeller, a publisher, ended in divorce in 1960. Her 1962 marriage to Robert James Westhoff, an American ceramicist and sculptor, ended in divorce in 1963.         Her survivors include a son, Denis, from her marriage to Mr. Westhoff.         Ms. Sagan's views on romance could be somber. In a 1980 interview, she said: ''I think love is like an illness, an intoxication. Sometimes I've been intoxicated for three or four years, but never more. I think that people can be happy together for longer than I used to believe, but I still don't think it can be forever.''         In a 1993 interview before her second drug trial, Ms. Sagan recalled: ''I had incredible luck because just when I grew up, the pill came along. When I was 18, I used to die with fear of being pregnant, but then it arrived, and love was free and without consequence for nearly 30 years. Then AIDS came. Those 30 years coincided with my adulthood, the age for having fun.''       
         Nuha al-Radi, the Iraqi artist and diarist whose work depicted her country's tribulations with a wry, impish wit, has died in Beirut. She was 63.         Ms. Radi died on Aug. 30, of pneumonia, her immune system severely weakened as a result of treatment for leukemia, said her sister, Selma al-Radi, speaking by telephone from the Lebanese capital.         Although both a ceramist and a painter, Ms. Radi was best known for her book ''Baghdad Diaries,'' a vivid account of the texture of daily life during the first gulf war and its aftermath, when she found shelter from the bombing in the family orchard in a well-to-do neighborhood.         ''The birds have taken the worst beating of all,'' she wrote. ''They have sensitive souls, which cannot take all this hideous noise and vibration. All the caged lovebirds have died from the shock of the blasts, while birds in the wild fly upside down and do crazy somersaults. Hundreds, if not thousands, have died in the orchard. Lonely survivors fly about in a distracted fashion.''         After the book was reissued last year in the wake of the second gulf war, Michiko Kakutani wrote in a review in The New York Times that ''the opening sections of these diaries give the reader a tactile and highly personal sense of how the allied bombing of Baghdad in 1991 affected ordinary Iraqi civilians. These descriptions can be read as a harbinger, in some respects, of residents' efforts to cope with the recent war and the continuing postwar upheaval.''         While not overtly political, Ms. Radi had no love for either the government controlling Iraq or for the United States for repeatedly causing destruction in Baghdad, her native city.         The book brims with criticism of the United States for making Iraqi civilians bear the brunt of the violence in their efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein, while depicting the grim resignation and black humor Iraqis used to survive under his violent rule.         She relates in matter-of-fact detail how a friend's nanny working in one of the presidential palaces told about what happens to thieves:         ''She said that when someone was caught stealing, they gathered the staff together, brought in a doctor, who chopped off this guy's hand, and immediately dunked it into boiling oil to cauterize it.''         The work also included jokes like the one about Mr. Hussein asking his cabinet members what time it is, with them responding in unison, ''Whatever time you want, sir.''         After her book's publication Ms. Radi, uncertain of the reaction from the government, chose to live in exile in Beirut, following something of a family tradition. She was born in 1941 in Baghdad. Her father was an Iraqi diplomat who served as the country's ambassador to Iran and India until the monarchy was overthrown in 1958.         The family later moved to Beirut, where her survivors still live periodically. They include her mother, Suad Munir Abbas; a brother, Abbad, of Abu Dhabi and Toronto, and her sister, Selma, a renowned archaeologist who has done extensive work on preserving historic buildings in Yemen.         In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Radi studied pottery at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London before moving to Beirut and teaching for a short period at the American University there. With the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon, she returned to Baghdad, where her work included several government commissions for large ceramic tableaus.         Ms. Radi used to joke that even the attempt to see her work was a perfect reflection of the turmoil in her country: one massive piece showing a magic carpet flight from ''1,001 Nights'' hung on a government building facing the Iranian Embassy while the other graced a presidential palace and was therefore off limits.         Taking visitors around the Iraqi capital in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, she would nod toward the work near the embassy and tell them not to point and not to take pictures and that stopping to look was certainly out of the question.         Her work often combined a certain whimsy with the darker aspects of life in the Middle East. One exhibition, titled ''Embargo Art,'' held in Amman during the late 1990's, a period of Western sanctions against Iraq, consisted of ''found objects'' like old mufflers from cars, the kind of things Iraqis had to use to get by, she said.         Ms. Radi was especially trenchant in describing the growing divide between the West and the Arab world, one to which she was particularly attuned, given her ease at working in both cultures.         In her diary, she tells of an encounter in Baghdad during which a woman wishes that some great catastrophe would ''envelop the U.S. and swallow the whole continent.'' When someone else in the conversation protests that his brothers living there would perish, the woman responds, ''They can go down with it.''         Last year, weeks after Mr. Hussein was overthrown, Ms. Radi went back to Baghdad to spend several weeks with her mother, who had refused to leave, comparing herself to Scarlett O'Hara after having survived so many wars in Iraq.         Ms. Radi, who usually managed to find a flower to tuck behind her ear every day no matter what war-ravaged city she was in, scampered through the wreckage of Mr. Hussein's compound and found happily that much of her large ceramic tableau of Iraq had survived the bombing unscathed.         She was somewhat less than enchanted with Iraq's latest overseers for failing to provide basic security and services, however, describing the new tenants of the presidential compound in an interview with The Times last year in her typically caustically droll manner:         ''America is in its ivory tower palace,'' she said, ''We are used to having coups and revolutions. But usually people who stage them take over the country afterward.''       
         Ilona Marton, an award-winning journalist who was imprisoned for her coverage of events leading up to the Hungarian uprising of 1956, died Saturday at her home in Silver Spring, Md. She was 92.         The cause was heart failure, her daughter, Kati Marton, said.         With her husband, Dr. Marton received a George Polk Award in 1957. The award is presented annually for reporting, often at great personal risk, in the public interest.         Writing for United Press, the precursor of United Press International, Dr. Marton covered the Communist takeover of Hungary, often in competition with her husband, Endre Marton, a reporter for The Associated Press.         ''She became a journalist, although that was an almost recklessly brave thing to do in the chilliest days of the cold war, because she wanted to be with my father,'' Kati Marton said in a telephone interview.         In 1955, the Martons were arrested on manufactured charges of spying for the United States. They were tried and convicted by a secret Hungarian military court but freed the following year, in time to cover the anti-Communist uprising and its suppression by Soviet forces.         After the uprising, Dr. Marton helped organize a general strike, an activity that placed her in renewed danger of arrest. Alerted that the secret police were closing in, the Martons and their children were smuggled out of Hungary, first to Vienna and later to the United States. There Dr. Marton worked as a French teacher in Maryland high schools.         Ilona Marton was born March 14, 1912, in the Hungarian town of Miskolc. Her parents were Jewish -- the family's original name was Neumann -- and at 19 she adopted the surname Nyilas to pass as Catholic. In 1944, her parents were deported to Auschwitz, where both died.         Dr. Marton earned a master's degree in history and a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Debrecen. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she married Mr. Marton in 1943. He survives her, along with a sister, Magda, of Budapest; three children, Kati, of Manhattan, a journalist; Andrew, of Fort Worth; and Julia Marton-Lefevre of London; and four grandchildren.       
         Janet R. Whitman, former president and chairwoman of the Sheltering Arms foster care agency in New York, died on Sept. 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her son Charles S. Whitman III.         Mrs. Whitman, who was an officer or board member of several other charities and societies, belonged to a politically prominent family. Her father-in-law, Charles S. Whitman, was a governor of New York, and her daughter-in-law Christie Whitman is a former governor of New Jersey.         Mrs. Whitman was born Janet Russell on Jan. 2, 1919, in Manhattan and was a graduate of the Brearley School and Bryn Mawr College.         She was on the board of the Society for the Relief of Women and Children for more than 50 years, and she spent 35 years on the board of the Stony Wold-Herbert Fund, which makes grants to fight pulmonary disease.         Mrs. Whitman was national president of the Daughters of the Cincinnati, a historical society started by women descended from Revolutionary War officers, and was on the board of the Colonial Dames of America.         Her husband of 61 years, Charles S. Whitman Jr., a civil court judge, died in 2002. Besides her son Charles, her survivors include another son, John R., husband of the former governor; a daughter, Janet; and three grandchildren.       
         Janet Leigh, the demure but sexy blond movie star of the 1950's who will always be remembered for the 45-second shower scene in which she was slashed to death in Hitchcock's ''Psycho'' in 1960, died on Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 77.         The cause was vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, said Heidi Schaeffer, a spokeswoman for the family.         ''Psycho'' was a landmark in Hollywood moviemaking, both controversial and shocking, partly because of its violence and partly because the director did the unthinkable and killed off his star one-third of the way through the movie.         As Marion Crane, an embezzler on the run with $40,000, Ms. Leigh made the mistake of stopping for the night at the Bates Motel and taking a shower. She was apparently stabbed dozens of times, although the movie never showed the knife touching her flesh. Bernard Herrmann's shrill music underscored the slashes; the scene is beloved of both serious movie scholars and parodists.         ''It took us seven days to shoot that scene, and there were 70 camera setups for 45 seconds of footage,'' Hitchcock said in ''Hitchcock'' by the filmmaker François Truffaut.         After ''Psycho,'' for which Ms. Leigh received her only Academy Award nomination, was released, Mr. Hitchcock told his star that they could never work together again.         In a 1998 interview, Ms. Leigh remembered the director's words: ''Whatever I put you in, the audience would immediately think of 'Psycho.' It wouldn't be fair to the picture or the character.''         In a career with many forgettable films, Ms. Leigh starred in two other classic movies. She was the woman who met Frank Sinatra on a train in John Frankenheimer's thriller ''The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962), and Susan Vargas, the threatened American bride of the Mexican narcotics cop Charlton Heston in Orson Welles's film noir ''Touch of Evil'' (1958).         She played the role in ''Touch of Evil'' with a broken arm masked by a coat. ''I broke my arm doing a TV show the week before we started,'' Ms. Leigh told the interviewer Patrick Giles in 1998. ''I had it set at a 45-degree angle, not a 90-degree angle.''         When she told Welles, he said: ''Oh, that's no problem. When I heard you'd broken it, I thought about showing it like that in the picture. But Susan's on her honeymoon, so that's too weird, even for me.''         One of the first of a crop of post-World War II ingénues, Ms. Leigh was the love interest of Van Johnson in her debut film as a mountain girl in ''The Romance of Rosy Ridge'' (1947).         She became the darling of the fan magazines with her marriage to Tony Curtis in 1951. Ms. Leigh and the good-looking boy from the Bronx were the perfect embodiment of the young Hollywood of the 1950's, as they starred together in four films, including  ''The Black Shield of Falworth'' (1954) as a medieval lady and her would-be knight suitor. They were divorced in the early 1960's, and Ms. Curtis soon married Robert Brandt.         She was born Jeanette Helen Morrison on July 6, 1927, in the Central Valley town of Merced, Calif. Her parents moved from apartment to apartment and town to town. At the age of 14, Ms. Leigh escaped from home by eloping. The marriage was later annulled, and Ms. Leigh returned to high school, graduating just before her 16th birthday.         The 19-year-old Jeanette Morrison became a movie actress in classical old-Hollywood fashion. The MGM star Norma Shearer saw her photograph at a ski lodge where her parents were working as desk clerk and maid. A screen test at MGM was followed by a contract at $50 a week.         By 1949, a second marriage had ended in divorce, and Ms. Leigh was making five movies a year. The most memorable were the all-star ''Little Women'' (1949) -- in which June Allyson played the tomboyish heroine, Jo, Elizabeth Taylor played the selfish Amy; and Ms. Leigh was the nurturing, practical Meg -- and Anthony Mann's rough western ''The Naked Spur'' (1953), which pit the bounty hunter James Stewart against Robert Ryan, with a crop-haired Janet Leigh in the middle.         After 1966 Ms. Leigh turned to television, although she did appear with her younger daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, in John Carpenter's horror film ''The Fog'' in 1980.         Ms. Leigh is survived by her husband Robert Brandt and by Kelly Curtis and Jamie Lee Curtis, her daughters with Tony Curtis.         Ms. Leigh's own reaction to ''Psycho'' was visceral. After she saw the movie, she said many times, she never wanted to take a shower again.       
         Phyllis Williams Lehmann, an archaeologist and art historian known for reuniting the hand of one of the icons of Western art, the Winged Victory of Samothrace, with two of its long-lost fingers, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Haydenville, Mass. She was 91.         The cause was congestive heart failure, according to Smith College, where Dr. Lehmann taught for more than 30 years.         Dr. Lehmann was an authority on the monuments and architecture of Samothrace, a remote, mountainous island in the north Aegean. The island was considered crucial in the development of the art and architecture of the Hellenistic period, which lasted from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. until the mid-first century B.C.         Samothrace was the center of one of the most famous mystery cults of Greek antiquity; its rituals were carried out in the group of imposing buildings known as the Sanctuary of the Great Gods, erected between the fourth and the second centuries B.C. The first of these structures to be built in marble was dedicated by Alexander's father, Philip II. Alexander's successors also erected monuments in the sanctuary.         As a result, the ruins at Samothrace have been of continuing interest to archaeologists, who have excavated there since the 1860's. Dr. Lehmann, who first visited the island in 1938, did her early work there with her husband, the archaeologist Karl Lehmann. She was assistant field director of the excavation from 1948 to 1960 and acting director from 1960 to 1965, and she remained closely involved with Samothrace for the rest of her career. A member of the Smith faculty from 1946 to 1978, she was dean of the college from 1965 to 1970.         Phyllis Williams was born Nov. 30, 1912, in Brooklyn. She received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1934, and for the next two years worked at the Brooklyn Museum as an assistant in charge of the Classical collection. In 1936, she began her graduate work at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, which ran the excavation on Samothrace. She received her Ph.D. in 1943, and married Mr. Lehmann, the excavation's director, the next year. He died in 1960. No immediate family members survive.         Working on Samothrace in 1949, Phyllis Lehmann made one of her most important discoveries, a tall marble statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, dating from the second century B.C. Unearthed in three large pieces, Dr. Lehmann's statue was the third Nike to be found on the island. The first, the Winged Victory that today greets visitors to the Louvre from the top of an imposing staircase, was found in 1863 by the French archaeologist Charles Champoiseau. That statue, from around 190 B.C., was unearthed in fragments, probably damaged in an earthquake in the sixth century A.D. Reassembled in Paris, it lacked head, arms and hands.         In the 1870's, Austrian archaeologists uncovered a second Nike on Samothrace, this one a Roman copy. They took it to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, along with an unrelated assortment of marble fragments also found on the island. The fragments remained at the museum, unidentified and forgotten, for three-quarters of a century.         Dr. Lehmann's Nike, which had stood atop a building called the Hieron, is today on display in a museum on Samothrace.         In 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's Winged Victory. The hand, which had lost its fingers, had slid out of sight, under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood. The team also found the tip of the ring finger nearby.         On their way home from Samothrace, the Lehmanns stopped in Vienna, where Phyllis sifted through the dusty storerooms of the Kunsthistorisches Museum. Examining the fragments left there by the Austrian team more than 70 years before, she found the rest of Winged Victory's ring finger and a thumb. The hand, with thumb and finger reattached, is displayed at the Louvre in a glass case next to the statue.         Dr. Lehmann's many books include ''The Pedimental Sculptures of the Hieron in Samothrace'' (1962) and ''Samothrace III: The Hieron,'' which was awarded the Alice Davis Hitchcock Book Award of the Society of Architectural Historians in 1969.         She was made an honorary citizen of Samothrace in 1968.       
         Bernice Rubens, a prolific British novelist who drew on her Jewish upbringing and ill-fated marriage to tell stories of vice and grimness with warmth and even humor, died on Oct. 13 in London, British newspapers reported. She was 76.         Ms. Rubens won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for fiction in 1970 for ''The Elected Member,'' the story of a Jewish family whose secrets drive one son insane.         ''Madame Sousatzka,'' her 1962 novel about the tenuous bond between an eccentric piano teacher and a child prodigy, was adapted in 1988 into a film with Shirley MacLaine in the title role.         Ms. Rubens wrote the first of her 25 books when she was 35, to cope with what she later described to The New York Times as ''the kind of despair that any intelligent woman has today.'' She said she thought of writing as therapy.         The daughter of Orthodox Jews, and the lone non-musician among gifted siblings, Ms. Rubens made family relationships and expectations frequent themes in her stories, placing familiar characters in peculiar circumstances.         In ''Spring Sonata'' (1979), a fetus decides against being born after listening to its parents' high expectations, while ''Brothers'' (1983) follows four generations of a Jewish family that flees Russia for Europe, as Ms. Rubens's father did.         In 1966, while still married to her husband, she wrote a thinly veiled account of his infidelity in ''Mate in Three.'' They divorced a few years later.         Bernice Ruth Rubens was born in Cardiff, Wales, on July 26, 1928, and studied English literature at Cardiff University, graduating in 1948 and then teaching in Birmingham, England.         She started writing after her two daughters entered nursery school. At roughly the same time, she began creating documentary films with humanitarian themes, often focusing on people with disabilities. She traveled to Asia and Africa to document the role of women in rural development.         She was writing her memoirs when she died.         She is survived by two daughters, Sharon and Rebecca.       
         Terry Dintenfass, a longtime New York art dealer whose gallery brought together several currents from outside the mainstream of 20th-century art, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         Her death was reported by her son Andrew Dintenfass.         For nearly 40 years the Terry Dintenfass gallery swam mostly against the tide of the rest of the art world. In the era of Pop and Minimal Art, Ms. Dintenfass was drawn to politically aware figurative painting rooted in the Social Realism of the 1930's.         She also represented the estates of first-generation American modernists like Arthur Dove and Charles Sheeler, as well as that of Ben Shahn.         At a time when nearly all artists showing in New York galleries were white, she represented several black artists, most notably Jacob Lawrence, but also Raymond Saunders, Richard Hunt and Walter Williams, a little-known painter whose work she showed in her first gallery, which was in Atlantic City.         She also represented the estate of Horace Pippin, a black folk artist, and worked on an important traveling exhibition of his work in 1977 that was organized by the Phillips Collection in Washington.         And, even though the line separating high and low culture was fairly firm, she also exhibited artists with a strong illustrational bent, like Ronald Markman, Richard Merkin and Robert Andrew Parker, as well as Edward Koren, a cartoonist for The New Yorker.         Ms. Dintenfass's life was an unusual mixture of propriety, activism and bohemianism. Born Theresa Kline on Easter in 1920, she grew up in Atlantic City, where her family owned a small department store.         She and her brother, Nathan S. Kline (author of ''From Sad to Glad,'' about depression), lived in a house full of art, books and music, with parents who wanted their children to be aware of people different from themselves.         Ms. Dintenfass attended finishing school in Virginia and studied art on and off for years, mostly at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art in Philadelphia. In 1938 she married a surgeon, Arthur Dintenfass, and had three children; after World War II they settled in Atlantic City, where she ran her husband's medical office for several years.         Using a small trust fund, Ms. Dintenfass began buying one painting every year, often from the Whitney Museum of American Art's annual exhibitions of painting and sculpture.         Her first galleries, called D Contemporary Gallery, were in Atlantic City hotels. She showed work on consignment from prominent New York dealers, and became especially close to Edith Gregor Halpert, whose Downtown Gallery represented several artists from the Alfred Stieglitz circle. She also sold the work of Milton Avery.         In 1959 she opened a gallery in a garden apartment at 18 East 67th Street in Manhattan, where she also lived for several years. In 1975 she moved her gallery to a large space in Manhattan, at 50 West 57th Street, and retired in 1999. Her business is now run by her son Andrew.         Ms. Dintenfass's first marriage and a brief second one ended in divorce. In 1976 she married James M. Reed, a career diplomat who also worked for the American Friends Service Committee. Mr. Reed died in 1985. In addition to Andrew, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., Ms. Dintenfass is survived by two other children from her first marriage, Dr. John Dintenfass of Manhattan and Susan Subtle Dintenfass of Berkeley, Calif.; and three grandchildren.       
         Sister Nancy Salisbury, longtime headmistress of New York's oldest independent school for girls, the Convent of the Sacred Heart, died on Sept. 27 in Atherton, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was respiratory failure after a kidney infection, according to an announcement by the United States Province of the Society of the Sacred Heart, the Roman Catholic religious order she entered in 1952; according the practice of the order, she was known as Sister Salisbury.         In her 20 years as headmistress of Sacred Heart, which runs from prekindergarten to 12th grade, Sister Salisbury overhauled the school's curriculum, upgraded its facilities and nearly doubled its enrollment. In 1990, the school received a Blue Ribbon Award for Academic Excellence from the United States Department of Education.         Sister Salisbury was also vice chairwoman of the board of the New York State Association of Independent Schools and head of its accreditation commission.         Sister Salisbury was born May 15, 1930, in New York and attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Overbrook, Pa., one of several schools across the country founded by the Society of the Sacred Heart.         She received a bachelor's degree in history from Manhattanville College in 1962 and a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Detroit in 1968.         After teaching math at a Sacred Heart school in Grosse Pointe, Mich., she became head of the middle school of the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Conn. She was then headmistress for 10 years, starting in 1970.         In 1980, she became headmistress in New York. After retiring in 2000, she was a mentor to novice nuns in Chicago.         Over the years, Sister Salisbury also sat on the boards of Sacred Heart schools in Albany, Miami and Greenwich.         No immediate family members survive.       
         JOYCE ACCIAIOLI RUDGE is happy to be off her feet. ''It's so good to sit down; man, it's the best,'' she says, relishing the downtime from a morning that began with 70 e-mail messages from Italy. Her legs are tucked underneath her on a wooden bench in Federal Hall National Memorial, the Greek Revival landmark on Wall Street. The hall is now transformed into the downtown branch of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, with 21 portraits of the powerful Medici family dating to the 16th and 17th centuries.         Ms. Rudge is the organizer behind the Splendor of Florence, a cultural festival that is being staged throughout Lower Manhattan through Sunday, with tastings of Tuscan food, concerts and Florentine artisan craft shops in the glass-domed Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, and the Medici exhibition on Wall Street. She convinced the Uffizi to lend the Medici paintings for display until Nov. 12.         How did she manage to pull this off? ''It's all about networking; that's the key,'' says Ms. Rudge, who is 57 and a former fashion model. ''It's about people trusting that you are going to deliver what you say you're going to deliver.''         In the case of the Medici art, she says, the director of the Uffizi and Italian officials took a fancy to her pitch that the festival would bring together Florence's best artisans, many of them making the same beautiful products, including lace and jewelry, that are prominent in the Uffizi paintings hanging in Federal Hall.         ''They took an interest in the theme,'' Ms. Rudge says. ''They love their city, their artisans, and the idea of being able to help artisans who are under threat of extinction because everything is so manufactured these days.''         So who is Ms. Rudge, this delicate-boned beauty with smoky brown eyes and soaring cheekbones? Here's what we know. She was a hometown girl from Providence, R.I., who made good as a fashion model in Milan and Paris in the 1970's and early 1980's, gracing the covers of European Vogue and Cosmopolitan. She organized the first Splendor of Florence in Providence in 1999 as a tribute to her grandfathers, Italian artisans who came to America in the early 1900's. She repeated the festival in Philadelphia in 2001.         She seems to have a knack for organizing things, even rather splashy projects about which she knows very little. She has sailed only twice in her life, yet she handled the logistics for the Italian entry in the 1983 America's Cup race, getting loads of good press in Italy as the Italian sailors regaled the locals in Newport, R.I., with pasta dinners and danced into the night.         ''It established me as a person who could pull rabbits out of hats for Italian companies,'' says Ms. Rudge, elegantly dressed in a taupe-colored pantsuit, her shoulders covered in a striped Kenzo shawl.         In 1995, Ms. Rudge organized her first event in Lower Manhattan, an exhibition about engines of the Renaissance period called ''Mechanical Marvels: Invention in the Age of Leonardo.'' Sponsored by the Italian aeronautics company Finmeccanica, the event was also held in the Winter Garden. That is where she met the mayor of Florence and told him of her idea to celebrate Florentine artisans. Her grandparents are from Molise, a region southeast of Rome, but she says her ancestors are from Florence.         Ms. Rudge is found at the bottom of the grand marble staircase in the Winter Garden. She leans into her cellphone, chatting incessantly, alternating between Italian and English. She says she gets a kick out of working under pressure. She thrives on stress.         ''I could never do something at the same pace, every day,'' she says in a low, husky voice. ''I need to have these moments of high stress, high anxiety, an impossible schedule, then downtime. It's almost like climbing a mountain. Mind you, this is a very big mountain.''         AND what a climb it is. Ms. Rudge is on her cellphone, trying to find black cabbage for Tuscan chefs who consider it an absolute must for a thick peasant soup to be served in the Grill Room at the World Financial Center. Then she is on to another crisis: a Florentine artisan is toting around two suitcases of antique gold jewelry, too afraid to part with it. Ms. Rudge contemplates getting a Brink's armored truck to stash the gold. In the end, the most expensive gold is returned to Florence.         ''To do this job, you just have to be resourceful,'' she says. ''You don't need a degree.''         Ms. Rudge doesn't have a college degree. So does she have a bit of a complex about that?         ''I think you tend to overcompensate,'' she says. ''I've spent my life researching things.''         She moved to Italy at age 19 to discover her roots. Much to the dismay of her parents -- her father was a furniture maker, while her mother made costume jewelry -- she stayed in Europe to pursue a modeling career. She has been married for 15 years to Peter Rudge, an English-born music entrepreneur who managed the Rolling Stones and the Who, among others, in the 1970's. They have a home in London.         For the last couple of years, Ms. Rudge has been living in a hotel suite in Battery Park City, flitting between New York and Florence. She is now looking for a permanent home here. She wants to see the Splendor of Florence be an event every two years in downtown Manhattan.         ''I like solving problems, so I'm certainly having a field day here,'' she says, laughing.         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Yang Huanyi, the last woman to communicate secretly with others in a rare script used exclusively by women, died Sept. 20 in her home in Hunan Province, China. She was believed to be in her late 90's.         The New China News Agency reported her death, saying estimates of her age ranged from 95 to 98.         The script, Nushu, represents the language spoken in Jiangyong Prefecture in the rolling hills of southern Hunan Province. Women, who were denied education for many centuries in China, used it to share feminine feelings, including fears about arranged marriages, husbands and, of course, mothers-in-law.         ''By writing, so much suffering disappears,'' Ms. Yang said in an interview with Northwest Asian Weekly in 1996.         The news agency called Ms. Yang the ''last practitioner'' of Nushu.         However, Orie Endo, a language professor at Bunkyo University in Tokyo and a leading scholar of the writing system, said in an e-mail message that at least two other women knew and still used some Nushu. She said Ms. Yang was important because she was the last woman to use Nushu to communicate with other women under an oath of secrecy, the ancient way.         One of the women she said was conversant with the script is He Yanxin, who learned it from her grandmother. The other, He Jinhua, who like He Yanxin is in her 60's, began to teach herself to write Nushu in 1997.         Laura Miller, a professor of linguistic anthropology at Loyola University in Chicago, said in an e-mail message that she had heard reports that other anthropologists working in China had found other women who continued to use Nushu.         But its disappearance may be inevitable. In 2002, Time magazine included Nushu in the 50 percent of the world's 6,000 languages that might be extinct by 2050. An academic record is being preserved by scholars, some of them men. Also, the Chinese government supports the collection and study of Nushu script, partly to encourage tourism in the small part of Hunan Province where it was historically used. Nushu, which means ''female writing,'' contains at least 1,800 characters, each representing a spoken syllable, not an idea, as is the case for much of Chinese calligraphy, which has at least 50,000 characters. A script specific to one sex is rare among the world's languages, and popular writers have called Nushu ''the witch's script'' and the ''first language of women's liberation.''         Men once used the script but lost interest, not least because they were educated in Mandarin, Dr. Miller wrote in February on a Web site, keywords.oxus.net.         Women were not educated, and gathered at homes to make shoes or embroider. Though in early Chinese history, the penalty for creating languages was death, women quietly developed a code for their secret sorority.         ''What started as a simple way to express themselves became a chronicle of their private anguish,'' Zhao Liming, a Nushu specialist at Qinghua University in Beijing, said in an interview with The South China Post.         Men, who always understood spoken Nushu, derided the written form as ''ant characters'' or ''mosquito scrawls,'' the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported in June. Professor Zhao said the belief was that ''anything to do with women was inferior, insignificant.''         A principal function of the script was for communication among women who called themselves ''sworn sisters.'' Writing in verse on handkerchiefs, fans and elsewhere, they often used Nushu's vocabulary of more than 20,000 words to communicate about marriage as a tragic event. Hardbound booklets conveying deep anxieties about marriage were common wedding gifts in the region.         Chinese scholars began studying Nushu in the mid-1950's, but the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 prohibited its use as a leftover of feudalism. In the early 1980's, academics rediscovered it and the dozen old women who still used it. Yang Huanyi was born in a village in Hunan in 1909, Dr. Endo and at least one other source said. At 10, she began learning Nushu from a woman whose feet had been bound in the traditional fashion and could not find work. In the lessons, the teacher wrote a strip of characters, as Ms. Yang watched. The woman sang as she wrote, and Ms. Yang sang the same songs when she studied by herself.         Once Ms. Yang mastered Nushu, she, too, wrote for others, but charged only for marriage booklets. She married, but her husband died two years later after he was bitten by a snake. She then married a gambler who ran up big debts. They had eight children before he died.         Her family responsibilities and the deaths of her sworn sisters ended Ms. Yang's writing until 1990, when a scholar urged her to resume.         Ms. Yang is survived by two sons and a daughter, The South China Morning Post reported.       
         Hildy Parks Cohen, the producer, writer and actress known as Hildy Parks who wrote the first 20 Tony Awards telecasts as well as 20 other television specials, including the Emmy Awards, died on Thursday at the Actors Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 78.         The cause was complications of a recent stroke, said her son Christopher Cohen.         Ms. Parks was a partner with her husband, Alexander H. Cohen, one of the last old-time independent theatrical producers, with 101 Broadway and West End shows to his name. He died in 2000. Together, from 1967 to 1986, Mr. Cohen usually produced the Tonys, and Ms. Parks wrote them.         As a result of the couple's ministrations, the Tony shows were frequently held up as a model of what other award shows, like the Oscars, ought to be: fast-paced, lively and topical.         Mr. Cohen said his mother ''was the intellect, and Dad was the bravado'' in their Tony work. Political events always made their way into the presentations. Ms. Parks's own views were very much those of a liberal Democrat, and she went so far as to give up limousines for bicycles, cheerfully waving to her husband as he went by in his big black car.         Ms. Parks won two Emmy Awards: one in 1980 for producing the 34th annual Tony Awards and one for producing ''The Night of 100 Stars'' in 1982.         In a 1982 article in The New York Times, Carol Lawson described how Ms. Parks worked hard behind the scenes at the Tony Awards:         ''As the one who warms up the live audience with good-natured barbs at the theater industry before airtime, Mr. Cohen is the more visible member of the team; but it is Miss Parks who puts the whole thing together.'' Ms. Parks was both shrewd and down to earth, focusing on getting the awards show picked up by television by signing on names familiar to television viewers. She did all the research for the show herself at the Lincoln Center library.         She also wrote the 37th and 38th annual Emmy Awards; ''Plácido Domingo: Steppin' Out With the Ladies'' on ABC in 1985; and NBC's 60th anniversary show in 1986.         Besides her contributions to causes like housing for the homeless, Greenpeace, the Actors' Fund and animal rights (she often brought home animals that appeared in shows to become family pets), she was involved with Community Board 5 in Midtown Manhattan and was prominent in continuing efforts to acquire landmark status for all the Broadway theaters.         Hildy Parks was born in Washington on March 12, 1926. She graduated from the University of Virginia and soon after went to New York to make her stage debut as Curley's wife in ''Of Mice and Men'' at the New School. She made her Broadway debut in 1947, when she appeared in ''Bathsheba'' with James Mason. In 1948 she played the Girl in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' and was the only woman in the London cast of ''Mr. Roberts.''         After a brief marriage to Jackie Cooper, Ms. Parks met Mr. Cohen in 1953 while playing Gwendolyn Holly in the comedy ''Be Your Age'' at the 48th Street Theater. He was one of the play's producers. The play lasted only three days, but the marriage endured for 44 years.         Ms. Parks's involvement with theater also lasted for many years. In the 1983-84 season she worked as a producer or co-producer on the plays ''Edmund Kean,'' ''La Tragédie de Carmen'' and ''Play Memory.'' In 1984 she and her husband co-produced Dario Fo's play ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''         Ms. Parks also acted in films, like ''Fail Safe'' in 1964 and ''The Group'' in 1966, and made regular appearances on major television shows for 12 years. They ranged from ''Philco Playhouse'' and ''Studio One'' to ''To Tell the Truth,'' on which she was a frequent panelist. From 1951 to 1955, she played the character Ellie Crown in the daytime series ''Love of Life.''         In addition to Christopher Cohen, Ms. Parks is survived by her son Gerald Cohen and a stepdaughter, Barbara Cohen Hoffman.       
         Helen Gee, whose Limelight photography gallery in Greenwich Village in the 1950's became a pioneering blueprint for the offering and selling of photography as an art form, died on Sunday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 85. Her death was announced by a friend, John Erdman.         Spacious and well lit, the Limelight was started in May 1954 and supported by the adjoining coffeehouse. Although a market in fine photographs was almost nonexistent, for about seven years Limelight carried on as if there were one, setting the standard for successors that came in a trickle in the early 1970's and grew into a flood by the 1990's. Ms. Gee mounted new shows at roughly five-week intervals and wrote the news releases.         Two earlier galleries -- Alfred Stieglitz's 291 early in the 20th century and Julien Levy's in the 1930's -- had tried to sell photographs but without success. Limelight did somewhat better. An Atget show, with the prints made by Berenice Abbott and priced at $20 each, was almost a sellout. More than half the pictures in an Edward Weston exhibition, at $75 a print, were bought. But rare photographs, photograms and photomontages by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (priced between $100 and $200) failed to sell. Prints by Robert Frank ($25 each) and Julia Margaret Cameron ($65 each) found only a few buyers. Limelight was the showcase for a wide variety of photographic styles, from classic straight photography (Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham) to social documentary (Brassai, Lisette Model, W. Eugene Smith) and subjective and experimental work (Rudolph Burckhardt, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind). Such a roster differed sharply from the generally homogeneous fare found in popular picture magazines like Life and Look.         Before opening Limelight, Ms. Gee had been a successful retoucher of color transparencies. She briefly took photography courses with Alexey Brodovitch, Model and Sid Grossman. But what Ms. Gee lacked in coffeehouse experience, she made up for in iron determination, familiarity with the Village art and photography worlds, and personal charm.         In her 1997 memoir, ''Limelight: A Greenwich Village Photography Gallery and Coffeehouse in the 50's'' (University of New Mexico Press), Ms. Gee recalled with wry humor and unsentimental directness her struggles with freeloading drug addicts, the lack of adequate help, the threat of bankruptcy as well as brutish union officials.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Mary Cantwell described how Ms. Gee ''had to survive a crooked contractor, a plague of city inspectors, hours in the Bowery's restaurant supply stores and an inundation of Seven Sisters graduates and dropouts all looking to be doing 'something' that would bring them closer to the arts.''         Helen Charlotte Wimmer was born on April 29, 1919, in Jersey City. Her father, Peter Wimmer, had trained in Europe as a church decorator. Settling in New York, he supported his family by painting apartments.         At 16, Helen left home to live in Greenwich Village with Yun Gee, a Chinese modernist painter she had met through an art teacher. They were married in 1942. When Yun Gee, subsequently found to be schizophrenic, threatened to turn violent, Ms. Gee left with their infant daughter, Li-lan.         With a child to support, she taught herself transparency retouching, which paid well. By the early 1950's, with leading magazines and advertising agencies for clients, she could afford a secretary, private school for Li-lan and designer clothes. It was during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art that Ms. Gee came across a photography show and was instantly hooked.         Financial and labor pressures forced Ms. Gee to close the Limelight's doors on Jan. 31, 1961. She then became an art consultant and also started to revive interest in Yun Gee's work. When the photography market began to heat up in the late 1970's, Ms. Gee returned to photography, this time as a curator, lecturer and writer.         In late 2001 and early 2002, Ms. Gee offered her collection of photographs for exhibition and sale, first at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago and then at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in New York. Most of the prints had been given to Ms. Gee by photographers whose work had appeared at Limelight.         Ms. Gee's second marriage, to Kevin Sullivan, ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Li-lan Gee, an artist who lives in Easthampton, L.I., she is survived by a sister, Ellen Berland, of Warren, Conn., and a brother, Henry Wimmer, of Bath, N.Y.

         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Miriam Schlein, whose nearly one hundred books, written over half a century, taught very young children about animals and concepts like time and space, died on Nov. 23 in New York. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, her family said.         Ms. Schlein wrote to educate while also entertaining her readers. She found new ways of telling them about bats and skunks and porcupines and their behavior even as she cleared up myths about them. Some of her recent books were about dinosaurs, and four are currently in print: ''Before the Dinosaurs'' (1996), illustrated by Michael Rothman; ''The Dino Quiz Book'' (1995), illustrated by Nate Evans; ''Let's Go Dinosaur Tracking!'' (1991), illustrated by Kate Duke; and ''Discovering Dinosaur Babies'' (1991), illustrated by Margaret Colbert.         Other works featured elephants, pandas, sea horses. pigeons and squirrels. Two new books, her last, appeared this year: ''The Story About Me,'' and ''Little Raccoon's Big Question.'' She first appeared in print in 1951 with ''A Day at the Playground'' from Golden Books, where she worked as a secretary.         Ms. Schlein was born in Brooklyn. She received a B.A. in English and psychology from Brooklyn College in 1947 and then held a number of jobs in advertising and publishing.         She was in the children's department of Simon & Schuster when she decided that her future lay in writing. She pursued it with a series of books about concepts, illustrated by Leonard Kessler and published by William R. Scott. They included ''Shapes'' (1952) and ''Heavy Is a Hippopotamus.'' In the 1950's she also wrote some stories about children and animals that won her wide recognition and awards, including ''Four Little Foxes,'' ''Elephant Herd,'' and ''When Will the World Be Mine?'' about a baby snowshoe rabbit, which The New Yorker called ''a poetic book.''         Some of her books were Junior Literary Guild Selections and several of her natural-science titles received Outstanding Science Books for Children awards. ''When Will the World Be Mine?'' (1953), republished 20 years later as ''The Rabbit's World,'' was named a Caldecott Honor Book.         Her marriage to Harvey Weiss of Westport, Conn., an artist who illustrated some of her early work, ended in divorce.         Ms. Schlein is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth S. Weiss of Union City, N.J.; a son, John M. Weiss of Brooklyn; a brother, Dr. Paul Schlein of Bethesda, Md.; and four grandchildren.       
         Gretchen Bender, an artist who worked in several photographic and film mediums, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bender belonged to the generation of early 1980's Pictures artists, who included Jack Goldstein, Cindy Sherman, Robert Longo and Richard Prince. Combining aspects of Conceptual Art and Pop Art, these artists used the images of popular culture to dissect its powerful codes, especially regarding gender and sexuality.         Ms. Bender was born in Seaford, Del., earned a bachelor of fine arts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1973 and moved to New York in 1978. She had her first New York gallery show at the Nature Morte Gallery in the East Village in 1983. Made of black-on-white enamel on squares of tin in cruciform arrangements, Ms. Bender's early work contrasted different categories of images from abstract art, glossy advertising and new photographs. She also appropriated from the mostly male Neo Expressionist painters of her generation and in harsher pieces paired impersonal computerized patterns with grisly images of massacres. Throughout her work she contrasted the immense power of technology and corporations with the plight of individuals.         Ms. Bender did not limit her activities to the art world. The credits she designed for the television show ''America's Most Wanted'' may have originated the rapid-fire hyperediting now pervasive in film, television and video art. She produced, directed and edited music videos for Babes in Toyland and Martha Wash; edited music videos for R.E.M., New Order and Megadeth; and designed sets for the choreographers Bill T. Jones and Molissa Fenley. Her midcareer retrospective, organized by the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse in 1991, toured internationally, as did her multimedia theater pieces ''Total Recall'' (1987) and ''Dumping Core'' (1984).         Ms. Bender's work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Menil Collection in Houston.         Ms. Bender is survived by her partner, Mitchell Wagenberg of Manhattan; her parents, Charles and Carolyn Bender of Charlotte, N. C.; a brother, Jonathan Bender of Los Angeles; and two sisters, Kate Bender of Charlotte and Valerie Godwin of Philadelphia.       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Bernarda Bryson Shahn, the widow of the painter Ben Shahn, who won her own recognition as an artist late in life, died on Sunday at her home in Roosevelt, N.J., her son, Jonathan Shahn, said. She was 101.         Ms. Shahn, who began her career as a writer, printmaker and illustrator, was best known in recent decades for her paintings, which critics described as simultaneously realistic and mysterious in style.         Her one-woman exhibitions included shows at Midtown Galleries in New York in 1983; at the Ben Shahn Galleries of William Paterson University in Wayne, N.J., in 2002; and at the Susan Teller Gallery in Lower Manhattan last year in honor of her 100th birthday. Ms. Shahn's work is in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and other institutions.         Bernarda Bryson was born on March 7, 1903, in Athens, Ohio. From her family, she inherited both an interest in writing (her father owned The Athens Morning Journal) and the progressive social conscience that informed much of her work (her maternal grandfather's home had been a stop on the underground railroad). She studied printmaking at several schools, including Ohio University, Ohio State and the Cleveland School of Art.         After an early marriage that ended in divorce, Ms. Shahn went to work as a newspaper journalist. In 1933, she traveled to New York to interview the muralist Diego Rivera for an Ohio newspaper. There, she met Rivera's assistant, Ben Shahn, who became her life companion. They married shortly before Mr. Shahn's death, in 1969.         In the mid-1930's, the couple drove across the country, documenting rural life for the Resettlement Administration. Ms. Shahn's series of lithographs from that trip was published in 1995 as ''The Vanishing American Frontier.'' She collaborated with her husband on two of his New Deal-era murals, one in what is now the Roosevelt Public School in Roosevelt, N.J., and the other in the Bronx General Post Office. Both still exist.         In midcareer, Ms. Shahn turned primarily to illustration. She wrote and illustrated several children's books, including ''The Zoo of Zeus'' (1964) and ''Gilgamesh'' (1967). She also wrote a 1972 monograph on Ben Shahn's work.         In addition to her son, a sculptor, who lives in Roosevelt, Ms. Shahn is survived by a daughter, Abby Shahn, a painter, of Solon, Me.; another daughter, Susanna Watts, died in 1967. She is also survived by two stepchildren from Mr. Shahn's previous marriage, Ezra of Riverdale, the Bronx, and Judith Shahn Dugan, a painter, of Truro, Mass.; three grandchildren; one step-grandchild; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Agnes Martin, an American painter whose luminous fields of pale color traversed by hand-drawn pencil lines preserved the Romantic spirit of Abstract Expressionism and prefigured the austerities of Minimalism, died yesterday in a retirement community in Taos, N.M.         She was 92 and had lived in New Mexico for many years. Her death was announced by the chairman of the PaceWildenstein gallery, Arne Glimcher, her friend and longtime dealer.         In New York in the 1950's and 60's, Ms. Martin was an integral part of a small, brilliant, diverse community of artists -- Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg among them -- who lived in derelict 19th-century shipping lofts in Lower Manhattan and created a new postwar American art.         Yet Ms. Martin was fundamentally a loner. In 1967, when her New York career was taking off, she abruptly left the city, wandered the country for months in a pickup and camper, and stopped making art for seven years. She finally settled in New Mexico, building an adobe house with her own hands on a remote mesa where in winter she was snowed in for weeks at a time. After she resumed painting in 1974 her reputation grew and took on the aura of a legend, and her work was widely collected. She became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher, attracted to her undemonstrative but intensely personal art.         Agnes Bernice Martin was born in Macklin, Saskatchewan, Canada, on March 22, 1912, a descendant of Scottish Presbyterian pioneers. Her father, a wheat farmer, died when she was 2; her mother supported the family by selling real estate. Ms. Martin spent much of her childhood with her maternal grandfather, a gentle, religious man who introduced her to inspirational literature, including John Bunyan's ''Pilgrim's Progress,'' which remained important to her throughout her life.         She had a strong early interest in art, but opted for the financial security of teaching, and in the 1940's moved to New York to study art education at Teachers College, Columbia University. While there she became aware of Abstract Expressionism, the modern style that she felt most in tune with, partly because its artists were of her generation; she and Jackson Pollock were born in the same year. It is possible to view her as the last of the generation of Abstract Expressionists.         After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D.T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life.         ''One thing I like about Zen,'' she wrote. ''It doesn't believe in achievement. I don't think the way to succeed is by doing something aggressive. Aggression is weak-minded.''         In Taos in 1954 she did her first semiabstract work. The art dealer Betty Parsons saw it and invited Ms. Martin to join her New York stable, which included Ad Reinhardt and younger artists like Mr. Kelly. The only stipulation was that Ms. Martin return to Manhattan. She did so in 1957, joining Mr. Kelly, Robert Indiana, Lenore Tawney and other artists on Coenties Slip near Wall Street. Barnett Newman, with whose art she felt a particular affinity, had a studio nearby. During the decade she spent there, she developed a fully abstract style based on tight grids and repetitive linear marks.         Then she left New York. Urban renewal was about to drastically alter her downtown neighborhood. The competitive New York art world unnerved her. A relationship may have gone wrong. Ms. Martin, who had a history of psychological crises, said elliptically, ''I came to a place of recognition of confusion that had to be solved.''         Before leaving she gave away all her paint and canvas rolls, hoping young artists would use them. Once she starting painting again in 1974, however, she worked solidly until the end of her life, in a format that seldom varied: six-foot-square canvases on which she drew horizontal graphite lines and painted bands of color with subtly vigorous strokes. She changed her palette from series to series, using pale colors one year, and black, white or gray the next.         She first showed at PaceWildenstein, formerly Pace Gallery, in 1975, and became a mainstay there. Her most recent show was in the spring, and in a departure, the paintings referred back to the geometric forms of her Coenties Slip work.         She had two career retrospectives, one at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973, the other at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1992. In 1993 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam organized a traveling survey of her post-1974 work. A selection of early paintings is on view at Dia:Beacon through April. And an installation of paintings is on permanent view in a specially designed gallery in the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos. Her work is in most major United States museum collections.         Ms. Martin was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Clinton in 1998 and recently accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Women's Caucus for Art.         Several years ago she moved to the retirement community. There her daily routine seldom varied. She rose early and drove to her nearby studio, where she worked alone from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. One of the few concessions she made to age was to reduce the size of her paintings so that she could continue to move them herself. She never had an assistant.         Although shy in public, Ms. Martin lectured periodically, offering her thoughts on art and life in series of epigrammatic statements that combined Victorian poetry, Buddhist philosophy, transcendentalism, American-style positive thinking and the inspirational literature of her youth. The lectures were collected into a book in 1992, ''Writings,'' which established her as a moral thinker as well as an artist. Some critics consider her words an essential complement to her ineffable paintings.         Like her paintings, her writing was lucid and severe, measured but driven. She insisted that art was not an instrument for social change and, in a post-1960's America highly conscious of racial and sexual identity, her social views tended to be conservative and provincial. Art's value, in her thinking, was in its ability to counteract negative thoughts and emotions, promote psychic calm over chaos, and establish stability in a world of unpredictable and potentially shattering change.         Before her death, Ms. Martin specified that she wanted no memorial service or eulogies. She leaves no survivors.         ''The value of art is in the observer,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times. ''When you find out what you like, you're really finding out about yourself. Beethoven's music is joyous. If you like his music, you know that you like to be joyful. People who look at my painting say that it makes them happy, like the feeling when you wake up in the morning. And happiness is the goal, isn't it?''
